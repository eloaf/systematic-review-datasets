        "title": "Rosuvastatin for lowering lipids",
        "abstract": "Background Rosuvastatin is one of the most potent statins and is currently widely prescribed. It is therefore important to know the dose\u2010related magnitude of effect of rosuvastatin on blood lipids.    Objectives Primary objective  To quantify the effects of various doses of rosuvastatin on serum total cholesterol, low\u2010density lipoprotein (LDL)\u2010cholesterol, high\u2010density lipoprotein (HDL)\u2010cholesterol, non\u2010HDL\u2010cholesterol and triglycerides in participants with and without evidence of cardiovascular disease.  Secondary objectives  To quantify the variability of the effect of various doses of rosuvastatin. To quantify withdrawals due to adverse effects (WDAEs) in the randomized placebo\u2010controlled trials.    Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) Issue 10 of 12, 2014 in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (1946 to October week 5 2014), EMBASE (1980 to 2014 week 44), Web of Science Core Collection (1970 to 5 November 2014) and BIOSIS Citation Index (1969 to 31 October 2014). No language restrictions were applied.    Selection criteria Randomized controlled and uncontrolled before\u2010and\u2010after trials evaluating the dose response of different fixed doses of rosuvastatin on blood lipids over a duration of three to 12 weeks.    Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed eligibility criteria for studies to be included and extracted data. WDAEs information was collected from the placebo\u2010controlled trials.    Main results One\u2010hundred and eight trials (18 placebo\u2010controlled and 90 before\u2010and\u2010after) evaluated the dose\u2010related efficacy of rosuvastatin in 19,596 participants. Rosuvastatin 10 to 40 mg/day caused LDL\u2010cholesterol decreases of 46% to 55%, when all the trials were combined using the generic inverse variance method. The quality of evidence for these effects is high. Log dose\u2010response data over doses of 1 to 80 mg, revealed strong linear dose\u2010related effects on blood total cholesterol, LDL\u2010cholesterol and non\u2010HDL\u2010cholesterol. When compared to atorvastatin, rosuvastatin was about three\u2010fold more potent at reducing LDL\u2010cholesterol. There was no dose\u2010related effect of rosuvastatin on blood HDL\u2010cholesterol, but overall, rosuvastatin increased HDL by 7%. There is a high risk of bias for the trials in this review, which would affect WDAEs, but unlikely to affect the lipid measurements. WDAEs were not statistically different between rosuvastatin and placebo in 10 of 18 of these short\u2010term trials (risk ratio 0.84; 95% confidence interval 0.48 to 1.47).    Authors' conclusions The total blood total cholesterol, LDL\u2010cholesterol and non\u2010HDL\u2010cholesterol\u2010lowering effect of rosuvastatin was linearly dependent on dose. Rosuvastatin log dose\u2010response data were linear over the commonly prescribed dose range. Based on an informal comparison with atorvastatin, this represents a three\u2010fold greater potency. This review did not provide a good estimate of the incidence of harms associated with rosuvastatin because of the short duration of the trials and the lack of reporting of adverse effects in 44% of the placebo\u2010controlled trials.",

Data from studies where rosuvastatin was administered in the morning, or evening, or where it was not specified were accepted. Trials required a washout baseline dietary stabilization period of at least three weeks where all previous lipid\u2010altering medication was withdrawn. This baseline phase ensures that participants follow a standard lipid\u2010regulating diet, and helps to stabilize baseline lipid values prior to treatment. Baseline dietary stabilization periods were not required in trials where participants were not receiving lipid\u2010altering medications or dietary supplements before receiving the test drug.",

        "abstract": "Background Oral anticoagulants may improve the survival of people with cancer through an antithrombotic effect, yet increase the risk of bleeding.    Objectives To evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral anticoagulants in ambulatory people with cancer undergoing chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, or radiotherapy (either alone or in combination), with no standard therapeutic or prophylactic indication for anticoagulation.    Search methods We conducted comprehensive searches on 14 June 2021, following the original electronic searches performed in February 2016 (last major search). We electronically searched the following databases: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase. In addition, we handsearched conference proceedings, checked references of included studies, and searched for ongoing studies. As part of the living systematic review approach, we are running continual searches and will incorporate new evidence rapidly after it is identified.    Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the benefits and harms of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) or direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in ambulatory people with cancer (i.e., not hospital inpatients during the time of their participation in trials) These people are typically undergoing systemic anticancer therapy, possibly including chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, or radiotherapy, but otherwise have no standard therapeutic or prophylactic indication for anticoagulation.    Data collection and analysis Using a standardised form, two review authors independently extracted data on study design, participants, intervention outcomes of interest, and risk of bias. Outcomes of interest included all\u2010cause mortality, pulmonary embolism, symptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT), major bleeding, minor bleeding and health\u2010related quality of life. We assessed the certainty of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach.    Main results Of 12,620 identified citations, 10 RCTs fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The oral anticoagulant was a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) in six of these RCTs, and a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) in the remaining four RCTs (three studies used apixaban; one used rivaroxaban). The comparator was either placebo or no prophylaxis.  Compared to no prophylaxis, vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) probably reduce mortality at six months slightly (risk ratio (RR) 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77 to 1.13; risk difference (RD) 22 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 72 fewer to 41 more; moderate\u2010certainty evidence), and probably reduce mortality at 12 months slightly (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.03; RD 29 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 75 fewer to 17 more; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). One study assessed the effect of a VKA compared to no prophylaxis on thrombosis; the evidence was very uncertain about the effect of VKA compared to no VKA on pulmonary embolism and symptomatic DVT (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.07 to 16.58; RD 0 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 6 fewer to 98 more; very low\u2010certainty evidence; RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.42; RD 35 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 37 fewer to 16 more; very low\u2010certainty evidence, respectively). Also, VKAs probably increase major and minor bleeding at 12 months (RR 2.93, 95% CI 1.86 to 4.62; RD 107 more per 1000, 95% CI 48 more to 201 more; moderate\u2010certainty evidence for major bleeding, and RR 3.14, 95% CI 1.85 to 5.32; RD 167 more per 1000, 95% CI 66 more to 337 more; moderate\u2010certainty evidence for minor bleeding).  Compared to no prophylaxis, at three to six months, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) probably reduce mortality slightly (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.38, RD 11 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 67 fewer to 70 more; moderate\u2010certainty evidence), probably reduce the risk of pulmonary embolism slightly compared to no prophylaxis (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.98; RD 24 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 35 fewer to 1 fewer; moderate\u2010certainty evidence), probably reduce symptomatic DVT slightly (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.15; RD 21 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 35 fewer to 8 more; moderate\u2010certainty evidence), probably do not increase major bleeding (RR 1.65, 95% CI 0.72 to 3.80; RD 9 more per 1000, 95% CI 4 fewer to 40 more; moderate\u2010certainty evidence), and may increase minor bleeding (RR 3.58, 95% CI 0.55 to 23.44; RD 55 more per 1000, 95% CI 10 fewer to 482 more; low\u2010certainty evidence).    Authors' conclusions In ambulatory people with cancer undergoing chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, or radiotherapy (either alone or in combination), the current evidence on VKA thromboprophylaxis suggests that the harm of major bleeding might outweigh the benefit of reduction in venous thromboembolism. With DOACs, the benefit of reduction in venous thromboembolic events outweighs the risk of major bleeding.  Editorial note: this is a living systematic review. Living systematic reviews offer a new approach to review updating in which the review is continually updated, incorporating relevant new evidence, as it becomes available.

            "Appendix 1. Living systematic review protocol": "The methods outlined below are specific to maintaining the review as a living systematic review on the Cochrane Library (Synnot 2017). They will be implemented immediately upon publication of this update. Core review methods, such as the criteria for considering studies in the review and assessment of risk of bias, are unchanged. As such, below we outline only those areas of the methods for which additional or different activities are planned or rules apply.  Search methods for identification of studies  We will rerun the majority of searches monthly. For electronic databases and other electronic sources (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase), we have set up auto\u2010alerts to deliver a monthly search yield by email. We will search the remaining resources (conference proceedings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), the American Society of Haematology (ASH) and ClinicalTrials.gov) on a monthly basis. For that purpose, we will note when these conference proceedings are published.  As additional steps to inform the living systematic review, we will contact corresponding authors of ongoing studies as they are identified and ask them to advise when results are available, and to share early or unpublished data. We will manually screen the reference list of any newly included studies, and identified relevant guidelines and systematic reviews.  We will review search methods and strategies approximately yearly, to ensure they reflect any terminology changes in the topic area, or in the databases.  Selection of studies  We will immediately screen any new citations retrieved by the monthly searches. As the first step of monthly screening, we will apply the machine learning classifier (RCT model) available in the Cochrane Register of Studies (CSR\u2010Web;\u00a0Wallace 2017). The machine learning classifier currently has a specificity/recall of 99.987%and assigns a probability score (from 0 to 100) to each citation for being a true RCT. Two review authors will independently screen any citations assigned a score from 10 to 100. Citations that score nine or less will be screened by Cochrane Crowd (Cochrane Crowd). Any citations that are deemed to be potential RCTs (i.e., scored 10 and above) \u00a0by Cochrane Crowd will be returned to the authors for screening.  Data synthesis  Whenever new evidence (studies, data, or information) that meets the review inclusion criteria is identified, we will immediately assess risk of bias and extract the data and incorporate it in the synthesis, as appropriate. We will not adjust the meta\u2010analyses to account for multiple testing given the methods related to frequent updating of meta\u2010analyses are under development (Simmonds 2017).  Other  We will review the review scope and methods approximately yearly, or more frequently if appropriate, given potential changes in the topic area, or the evidence being included in the review (e.g. additional comparisons, interventions, outcomes, or new review methods available).",

        "abstract": "Background Cancer increases the risk of thromboembolic events, especially in people receiving anticoagulation treatments.    Objectives To compare the efficacy and safety of low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs), direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), and other anticoagulants for the long\u2010term treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in people with cancer.    Search methods We conducted a literature search including a comprehensive electronic search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ), MEDLINE (Ovid), and Embase (Ovid); handsearching conference proceedings; checking references of included studies; \u00a0and a search for ongoing studies in trial registries. As part of the living systematic review approach, we run searches continually, incorporating new evidence after it is identified. Last search date 14 May 2021.    Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the benefits and harms of long\u2010term treatment with LMWHs, DOACs, VKAs, or other anticoagulants in people with cancer and symptomatic VTE.    Data collection and analysis We extracted data in duplicate on study characteristics and risk of bias. Outcomes included: all\u2010cause mortality, recurrent VTE, major bleeding, minor bleeding, thrombocytopenia, and health\u2010related quality of life (QoL). We assessed the certainty of the evidence at the outcome level following the GRADE approach (GRADE handbook [GRADE handbook]).    Main results Of 3583 citations,19 RCTs fulfilled the eligibility criteria. Low molecular weight heparins versus vitamin K antagonistsEight studies enrolling 2327 participants compared LMWHs with VKAs. Meta\u2010analysis of five studies probably did not rule out a beneficial or harmful effect of LMWHs compared to VKAs on mortality up to 12 months of follow\u2010up (risk ratio (RR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88 to 1.13; risk difference (RD) 0 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 45 fewer to 48 more; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). Meta\u2010analysis of four studies did not rule out a beneficial or harmful effect of LMWHs compared to VKAs on major bleeding (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.12; RD 4 more per 1000, 95% CI 19 fewer to 48 more, moderate\u2010certainty evidence) or minor bleeding (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.27; RD 38 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 92 fewer to 47 more; low\u2010certainty evidence), or thrombocytopenia (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.69). Meta\u2010analysis of five studies showed that LMWHs probably reduced the recurrence of VTE compared to VKAs (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.77; RD 53 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 29 fewer to 72 fewer, moderate\u2010certainty evidence).  Direct oral anticoagulants versus vitamin K antagonistsFive studies enrolling 982 participants compared DOACs with VKAs. Meta\u2010analysis of four studies may not rule out a beneficial or harmful effect of DOACs compared to VKAs on mortality (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.21; RD 12 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 51 fewer to 37 more; low\u2010certainty evidence), recurrent VTE (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.31; RD 14 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 27 fewer to 12 more; low\u2010certainty evidence), major bleeding (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.57, RD 8 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 22 fewer to 20 more; low\u2010certainty evidence), or minor bleeding (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.22; RD 21 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 54 fewer to 28 more; low\u2010certainty evidence). One study reporting on DOAC versus VKA was published as abstract so is not included in the main analysis.  Direct oral anticoagulants versus low molecular weight heparinsTwo studies enrolling 1455 participants compared DOAC with LMWH. The study by Raskob did not rule out a beneficial or harmful effect of DOACs compared to LMWH on mortality up to 12 months of follow\u2010up (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.25; RD 27 more per 1000, 95% CI 30 fewer to 95 more; low\u2010certainty evidence). The data also showed that DOACs may have shown a likely reduction in VTE recurrence up to 12 months of follow\u2010up compared to LMWH (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.01; RD 36 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 62 fewer to 1 more; low\u2010certainty evidence). DOAC may have increased major bleeding at 12 months of follow\u2010up compared to LMWH (RR 1.71, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.88; RD 29 more per 1000, 95% CI 0 fewer to 78 more; low\u2010certainty evidence) and likely increased minor bleeding up to 12 months of follow\u2010up compared to LMWH (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.80; RD 35 more per 1000, 95% CI 6 fewer to 92 more; low\u2010certainty evidence). The second study on DOAC versus LMWH was published as an abstract and is not included in the main analysis.  Idraparinux versus vitamin K antagonistsOne RCT with 284 participants compared once\u2010weekly subcutaneous injection of idraparinux versus standard treatment (parenteral anticoagulation followed by warfarin or acenocoumarol) for three or six months. The data probably did not rule out a beneficial or harmful effect of idraparinux compared to VKAs on mortality at six months (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.59; RD 31 more per 1000, 95% CI 62 fewer to 167 more; moderate\u2010certainty evidence), VTE recurrence at six months (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.32; RD 42 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 65 fewer to 25 more; low\u2010certainty evidence) or major bleeding (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.35 to 3.56; RD 4 more per 1000, 95% CI 25 fewer to 98 more; low\u2010certainty evidence).    Authors' conclusions For the long\u2010term treatment of VTE in people with cancer, evidence shows that LMWHs compared to VKAs probably produces an important reduction in VTE and DOACs compared to LMWH, may likely reduce VTE but may increase risk of major bleeding. Decisions for a person with cancer and VTE to start long\u2010term LMWHs versus oral anticoagulation should balance benefits and harms and integrate the person's values and preferences for the important outcomes and alternative management strategies.  Editorial note: this is a living systematic review (LSR). LSRs offer new approaches to review updating in which the review is continually updated, incorporating relevant new evidence as it becomes available.

            "Appendix 1. Living systematic review protocol": "The methods outlined below are specific to maintaining the review as a living systematic review in the Cochrane Library (Synnot 2017). They will be implemented immediately upon publication of this update. Core review methods, such as the criteria for considering studies in the review and assessment of risk of bias, are unchanged. As such, below we outline only those areas of the methods for which additional or different activities are planned or rules apply.   Search methods for identification of studies We will rerun the majority of searches monthly. For electronic databases and other electronic sources (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase), we have set up auto\u2010alerts to deliver a monthly search yield by email. We will search the remaining resources (conference proceedings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO); the American Society of Haematology (ASH); and clinicaltrials.gov) on a bi\u2010yearly basis. For that purpose, we will note when these conference proceedings are published.  As additional steps to inform the living systematic review, we will contact corresponding authors of ongoing studies as they are identified and ask them to advise when results are available, and to share early or unpublished data. We will contact the corresponding authors of any newly included studies for advice as to other relevant studies.We will manually screen the reference list of any newly included studies, and identified relevant guidelines and systematic reviews. .  We will review search methods and strategies approximately yearly, to ensure they reflect any terminology changes in the topic area, or in the databases.    Selection of studies We will immediately screen any new citations retrieved by the monthly searches. As the first step of monthly screening, we will apply the machine learning classifier (RCT model) available in the Cochrane Register of Studies (CSR\u2010web;\u00a0Wallace 2017). The classifier assigns a probability (from 0 to 100) to each citation for being a true RCT. For citations that are assigned a probability score of less than 10, the machine learning classifier currently has a specificity/recall of 99.987% (Thomas 2017). For citations assigned a score from 10 to 100, we will screen them in duplicate and independently. Citations that score 9 or less will be screened by\u00a0Cochrane Crowd. Any citations that are deemed to be potential RCTs by\u00a0Cochrane Crowd\u00a0will be returned to the authors for screening.    Data synthesis Whenever new evidence (studies, data or information) that meets the review inclusion criteria is identified, we will immediately assess risk of bias and extract the data and incorporate it in the synthesis, as appropriate. We will not adjust the meta\u2010analyses to account for multiple testing given the methods related to frequent updating of meta\u2010analyses are under development (Simmonds 2017).  Other  We will review the review scope and methods approximately yearly, or more frequently if appropriate, in light of potential changes in the topic area, or the evidence being included in the review (e.g. additional comparisons, interventions or outcomes, or new review methods available).",

        "abstract": "Background Anticoagulation may improve survival in patients with cancer through a speculated anti\u2010tumour effect, in addition to the antithrombotic effect, although may increase the risk of bleeding.    Objectives To evaluate the efficacy and safety of parenteral anticoagulants in ambulatory patients with cancer who, typically, are undergoing chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy or radiotherapy, but otherwise have no standard therapeutic or prophylactic indication for anticoagulation.    Search methods A comprehensive search included (1) a major electronic search (February 2016) of the following databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2016, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1946 to February 2016; accessed via OVID) and Embase (1980 to February 2016; accessed via OVID); (2) handsearching of conference proceedings; (3) checking of references of included studies; (4) use of the 'related citation' feature in PubMed and (5) a search for ongoing studies in trial registries. As part of the living systematic review approach, we are running searches continually and we will incorporate new evidence rapidly after it is identified. This update of the systematic review is based on the findings of a literature search conducted on 14 August 2017.    Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the benefits and harms of parenteral anticoagulation in ambulatory patients with cancer. Typically, these patients are undergoing chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy or radiotherapy, but otherwise have no standard therapeutic or prophylactic indication for anticoagulation.    Data collection and analysis Using a standardized form we extracted data in duplicate on study design, participants, interventions outcomes of interest, and risk of bias. Outcomes of interested included all\u2010cause mortality, symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE), symptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), major bleeding, minor bleeding, and quality of life. We assessed the certainty of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach (GRADE handbook [GRADE handbook]).    Main results Of 6947 identified citations, 19 RCTs fulfilled the eligibility criteria. These trials enrolled 9650 participants. Trial registries' searches identified nine registered but unpublished trials, two of which were labeled as 'ongoing trials'. In all included RCTs, the intervention consisted of heparin (either unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin). Overall, heparin appears to have no effect on mortality at 12 months (risk ratio (RR) 0.98; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 1.03; risk difference (RD) 10 fewer per 1000; 95% CI 35 fewer to 15 more; moderate certainty of evidence) and mortality at 24 months (RR 0.99; 95% CI 0.96 to 1.01; RD 8 fewer per 1000; 95% CI 31 fewer to 8 more; moderate certainty of evidence). Heparin therapy reduces the risk of symptomatic VTE (RR 0.56; 95% CI 0.47 to 0.68; RD 30 fewer per 1000; 95% CI 36 fewer to 22 fewer; high certainty of evidence), while it increases in the risks of major bleeding (RR 1.30; 95% 0.94 to 1.79; RD 4 more per 1000; 95% CI 1 fewer to 11 more; moderate certainty of evidence) and minor bleeding (RR 1.70; 95% 1.13 to 2.55; RD 17 more per 1000; 95% CI 3 more to 37 more; high certainty of evidence). Results failed to confirm or to exclude a beneficial or detrimental effect of heparin on thrombocytopenia (RR 0.69; 95% CI 0.37 to 1.27; RD 33 fewer per 1000; 95% CI 66 fewer to 28 more; moderate certainty of evidence); quality of life (moderate certainty of evidence).    Authors' conclusions Heparin appears to have no effect on mortality at 12 months and 24 months. It reduces symptomatic VTE and likely increases major and minor bleeding. Future research should further investigate the survival benefit of different types of anticoagulants in patients with different types and stages of cancer. The decision for a patient with cancer to start heparin therapy should balance the benefits and downsides, and should integrate the patient's values and preferences.  Editorial note:This is a living systematic review. Living systematic reviews offer a new approach to review updating in which the review is continually updated, incorporating relevant new evidence, as it becomes available.

            "Appendix 1. Living systematic review protocol": "The methods outlined below are specific to maintaining the review as a living systematic review in the Cochrane Library (Synnot 2017). They will be implemented immediately upon publication of this update. Core review methods, such as the criteria for considering studies in the review and assessment of risk of bias, are unchanged. As such, below we outline only those areas of the methods for which additional or different activities are planned or rules apply.  Search methods for identification of studies  We will re\u2010run the majority of searches monthly. For electronic databases and other electronic sources (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase), we have set up auto\u2010alerts to deliver a monthly search yield by email. We will search the remaining resources (conference proceedings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO); the American Society of Haematology (ASH); and clinicaltrials.gov) on a bi\u2010yearly basis. For that purpose, we will note when these conference proceedings are published.  As additional steps to inform the living systematic review, we will contact corresponding authors of ongoing studies as they are identified and ask them to advise when results are available, and to share early or unpublished data. We will contact the corresponding authors of any newly included studies for advice as to other relevant studies. We will conduct citation tracking of included studies in Web of Science Core Collection on an ongoing basis. For that purpose, we have set up citation alerts in Web of Science Core Collection. We will manually screen the reference list of any newly included studies, and identified relevant guidelines and systematic reviews. Also, we will use the 'related citation' feature in PubMed to identify additional articles.  We will review search methods and strategies approximately yearly, to ensure they reflect any terminology changes in the topic area, or in the databases.  Selection of studies  We will immediately screen any new citations retrieved by the monthly searches. As the first step of monthly screening, we will apply the machine learning classifier (RCT model) available in the Cochrane Register of Studies (CSR\u2010Web; Wallace 2017). The classifier assigns a probability (from 0 to 100) to each citation for being a true RCT. For citations that are assigned a probability score of less than 10, the machine learning classifier currently has a specificity/recall of 99.987% (James Thomas, personal communication). For citations assigned a score from 10 to 100, we will screen them in duplicate and independently. Citations that score 9 or less will be screened by Cochrane Crowd (Cochrane Crowd). Any citations that are deemed to be potential RCTs by Cochrane Crowd will be returned to the authors for screening.  Data synthesis  Whenever new evidence (studies, data or information) that meets the review inclusion criteria is identified, we will immediately assess risk of bias and extract the data and incorporate it in the synthesis, as appropriate. We will not adjust the meta\u2010analyses to account for multiple testing given the methods related to frequent updating of meta\u2010analyses are under development (Simmonds 2017).  Other  We will review the review scope and methods approximately yearly, or more frequently if appropriate, in light of potential changes in the topic area, or the evidence being included in the review (for example, additional comparisons, interventions or outcomes, or new review methods available).",
            "Appendix 2. Cochrane's living systematic review pilots": "Living systematic reviews offer a new approach to review updating in which the review is continually updated, incorporating relevant new evidence as it becomes available (Elliott 2017). Cochrane is exploring the feasibility of preparing and publishing living systematic reviews in a series of pilots (which includes this review). For the Cochrane pilots, searching is being conducted monthly, and new relevant evidence (studies, data or other information) will be incorporated into the review in a timely manner, so that the findings of the review remain current.  For the most up to date information about the review, the results of the searches and any new evidence being incorporated, readers are encouraged to check the update status information. The update status information will be updated whenever the searches are re\u2010run. The review will be updated with a new citation whenever a new study is found.",

        "title": "Early versus late tracheostomy for critically ill patients",
        "abstract": "Background Long\u2010term mechanical ventilation is the most common situation for which tracheostomy is indicated for patients in intensive care units (ICUs). 'Early' and 'late' tracheostomies are two categories of the timing of tracheostomy. Evidence on the advantages attributed to early versus late tracheostomy is somewhat conflicting but includes shorter hospital stays and lower mortality rates.    Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of early (\u2264 10 days after tracheal intubation) versus late tracheostomy (> 10 days after tracheal intubation) in critically ill adults predicted to be on prolonged mechanical ventilation with different clinical conditions.    Search methods This is an update of a review last published in 2012 (Issue 3, The Cochrane Library) with previous searches run in December 2010. In this version, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2013, Issue 8); MEDLINE (via PubMed) (1966 to August 2013); EMBASE (via Ovid) (1974 to August 2013); LILACS (1986 to August 2013); PEDro (Physiotherapy Evidence Database) at www.pedro.fhs.usyd.edu.au (1999 to August 2013) and CINAHL (1982 to August 2013). We reran the search in October 2014 and will deal with any studies of interest when we update the review.    Selection criteria We included all randomized and quasi\u2010randomized controlled trials (RCTs or QRCTs) comparing early tracheostomy (two to 10 days after intubation) against late tracheostomy (> 10 days after intubation) for critically ill adult patients expected to be on prolonged mechanical ventilation.    Data collection and analysis Two review authors extracted data and conducted a quality assessment. Meta\u2010analyses with random\u2010effects models were conducted for mortality, time spent on mechanical ventilation and time spent in the ICU.    Main results We included eight RCTs (N = 1977 participants). At the longest follow\u2010up time available in these studies, evidence of moderate quality from seven RCTs (n = 1903) showed lower mortality rates in the early as compared with the late tracheostomy group (risk ratio (RR) 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70 to 0.98; P value 0.03; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) \u2245 11). Divergent results were reported on the time spent on mechanical ventilation and no differences were noted for pneumonia, but the probability of discharge from the ICU was higher at day 28 in the early tracheostomy group (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.55; P value 0.006; NNTB \u2245 8).    Authors' conclusions The whole findings of this systematic review are no more than suggestive of the superiority of early over late tracheostomy because no information of high quality is available for specific subgroups with particular characteristics.",

        "title": "Parent\u2010infant psychotherapy for improving parental and infant mental health",
        "abstract": "Background Parent\u2010infant psychotherapy (PIP) is a dyadic intervention that works with parent and infant together, with the aim of improving the parent\u2010infant relationship and promoting infant attachment and optimal infant development. PIP aims to achieve this by targeting the mother\u2019s view of her infant, which may be affected by her own experiences, and linking them to her current relationship to her child, in order to improve the parent\u2010infant relationship directly.    Objectives 1. To assess the effectiveness of PIP in improving parental and infant mental health and the parent\u2010infant relationship.  2. To identify the programme components that appear to be associated with more effective outcomes and factors that modify intervention effectiveness (e.g. programme duration, programme focus).    Search methods We searched the following electronic databases on 13 January 2014: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2014, Issue 1), Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, BIOSIS Citation Index, Science Citation Index, ERIC, and Sociological Abstracts. We also searched the metaRegister of Controlled Trials, checked reference lists, and contacted study authors and other experts.    Selection criteria Two review authors assessed study eligibility independently. We included randomised controlled trials (RCT) and quasi\u2010randomised controlled trials (quasi\u2010RCT) that compared a PIP programme directed at parents with infants aged 24 months or less at study entry, with a control condition (i.e. waiting\u2010list, no treatment or treatment\u2010as\u2010usual), and used at least one standardised measure of parental or infant functioning. We also included studies that only used a second treatment group.    Data collection and analysis We adhered to the standard methodological procedures of The Cochrane Collaboration. We standardised the treatment effect for each outcome in each study by dividing the mean difference (MD) in post\u2010intervention scores between the intervention and control groups by the pooled standard deviation. We presented standardised mean differences (SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for continuous data, and risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous data. We undertook meta\u2010analysis using a random\u2010effects model.    Main results We included eight studies comprising 846 randomised participants, of which four studies involved comparisons of PIP with control groups only. Four studies involved comparisons with another treatment group (i.e. another PIP, video\u2010interaction guidance, psychoeducation, counselling or cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)), two of these studies included a control group in addition to an alternative treatment group. Samples included women with postpartum depression, anxious or insecure attachment, maltreated, and prison populations. We assessed potential bias (random sequence generation, allocation concealment, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, and other bias). Four studies were at low risk of bias in four or more domains. Four studies were at high risk of bias for allocation concealment, and no study blinded participants or personnel to the intervention. Five studies did not provide adequate information for assessment of risk of bias in at least one domain (rated as unclear).  Six studies contributed data to the PIP versus control comparisons producing 19 meta\u2010analyses of outcomes measured at post\u2010intervention or follow\u2010up, or both, for the primary outcomes of parental depression (both dichotomous and continuous data); measures of parent\u2010child interaction (i.e. maternal sensitivity, child involvement and parent engagement; infant attachment category (secure, avoidant, disorganised, resistant); attachment change (insecure to secure, stable secure, secure to insecure, stable insecure); infant behaviour and secondary outcomes (e.g. infant cognitive development). The results favoured neither PIP nor control for incidence of parental depression (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.04, 3 studies, 278 participants, low quality evidence) or parent\u2010reported levels of depression (SMD \u20100.22, 95% CI \u20100.46 to 0.02, 4 studies, 356 participants, low quality evidence). There were improvements favouring PIP in the proportion of infants securely attached at post\u2010intervention (RR 8.93, 95% CI 1.25 to 63.70, 2 studies, 168 participants, very low quality evidence); a reduction in the number of infants with an avoidant attachment style at post\u2010intervention (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.95, 2 studies, 168 participants, low quality evidence); fewer infants with disorganised attachment at post\u2010intervention (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.58, 2 studies, 168 participants, low quality evidence); and an increase in the proportion of infants moving from insecure to secure attachment at post\u2010intervention (RR 11.45, 95% CI 3.11 to 42.08, 2 studies, 168 participants, low quality evidence). There were no differences between PIP and control in any of the meta\u2010analyses for the remaining primary outcomes (i.e. adverse effects), or secondary outcomes.  Four studies contributed data at post\u2010intervention or follow\u2010up to the PIP versus alternative treatment analyses producing 15 meta\u2010analyses measuring parent mental health (depression); parent\u2010infant interaction (maternal sensitivity); infant attachment category (secure, avoidant, resistant, disorganised) and attachment change (insecure to secure, stable secure, secure to insecure, stable insecure); infant behaviour and infant cognitive development. None of the remaining meta\u2010analyses of PIP versus alternative treatment for primary outcomes (i.e. adverse effects), or secondary outcomes showed differences in outcome or any adverse changes.  We used the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group (GRADE) approach to rate the overall quality of the evidence. For all comparisons, we rated the evidence as low or very low quality for parental depression and secure or disorganised infant attachment. Where we downgraded the evidence, it was because there was risk of bias in the study design or execution of the trial. The included studies also involved relatively few participants and wide CI values (imprecision), and, in some cases, we detected clinical and statistical heterogeneity (inconsistency). Lower quality evidence resulted in lower confidence in the estimate of effect for those outcomes.    Authors' conclusions Although the findings of the current review suggest that PIP is a promising model in terms of improving infant attachment security in high\u2010risk families, there were no significant differences compared with no treatment or treatment\u2010as\u2010usual for other parent\u2010based or relationship\u2010based outcomes, and no evidence that PIP is more effective than other methods of working with parents and infants. Further rigorous research is needed to establish the impact of PIP on potentially important mediating factors such as parental mental health, reflective functioning, and parent\u2010infant interaction.",

            "Types of studies": "We pre\u2010specified our methods for this review in the protocol (Barlow 2013). We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi\u2010randomised controlled trials (quasi\u2010RCTs) in which participants had been randomly allocated to an experimental or a control group, the latter being a waiting\u2010list, no treatment, treatment\u2010as\u2010usual (normal service provision) or a placebo control group. We defined quasi\u2010RCTs as trials where allocation was done on the basis of a pseudo\u2010random sequence, for example, odd or even hospital number, date of birth or alternation (Higgins 2011). We also included studies comparing two different therapeutic modalities (i.e. without a control group).",
            "Types of participants": "We included studies involving parent\u2010infant dyads in which the parent was experiencing mental health problems, domestic abuse or substance dependency, with or without the infant showing signs of attachment or dysregulation problems, or both attachment and dysregulation problems. We included all infants irrespective of the presence of problems such as low birthweight, prematurity or disabilities. We included studies targeting infants and toddlers in which the mean age of the infant participants was 24 months or less at the point of referral. We included studies targeting all parents (i.e. including fathers, birth parents, adoptive and kinship parents, but not foster parents).",
            "Types of interventions": "We included studies that had evaluated the effectiveness of PIP programmes in which the intervention met all of the following criteria: underpinned by a psychodynamic model that involved making unconscious patterns of relating by targeting the parent\u2010therapist transference; parental internal working models or representations (i.e. the way in which the mother's current view of her infant was affected by interfering representations or unremembered influences from her own history, and to link them to her current functioning, in order to improve the parent\u2010infant relationship directly, thereby facilitating new paths for growth and development for both mother and infant);    delivered jointly to both parent and infant with a focus on the parent\u2010infant relationship/interaction and aimed primarily at improving infant attachment security, socio\u2010emotional functioning, or both, via the parent\u2010infant relationship/interaction;    delivered by a parent\u2010infant psychotherapist/specialist on a dyadic basis or to dyads in groups, in any setting (clinic, hospital or home), over any period of time. underpinned by a psychodynamic model that involved making unconscious patterns of relating by targeting the parent\u2010therapist transference; parental internal working models or representations (i.e. the way in which the mother's current view of her infant was affected by interfering representations or unremembered influences from her own history, and to link them to her current functioning, in order to improve the parent\u2010infant relationship directly, thereby facilitating new paths for growth and development for both mother and infant); delivered jointly to both parent and infant with a focus on the parent\u2010infant relationship/interaction and aimed primarily at improving infant attachment security, socio\u2010emotional functioning, or both, via the parent\u2010infant relationship/interaction; delivered by a parent\u2010infant psychotherapist/specialist on a dyadic basis or to dyads in groups, in any setting (clinic, hospital or home), over any period of time. We also included studies of PIPs that used additional components (i.e. provided they still met the core inclusion criteria). We excluded studies of interventions that were delivered to the parent or parents alone (e.g. interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) or that were dyadic but primarily psychoeducational or based on other therapeutic models (e.g. behavioural or cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)). We excluded studies of stand\u2010alone video\u2010interaction guidance interventions but not studies in which video feedback had been incorporated into a PIP that met the above criteria.",

        "criteria_text": "We pre\u2010specified our methods for this review in the protocol (Barlow 2013). We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi\u2010randomised controlled trials (quasi\u2010RCTs) in which participants had been randomly allocated to an experimental or a control group, the latter being a waiting\u2010list, no treatment, treatment\u2010as\u2010usual (normal service provision) or a placebo control group. We defined quasi\u2010RCTs as trials where allocation was done on the basis of a pseudo\u2010random sequence, for example, odd or even hospital number, date of birth or alternation (Higgins 2011). We also included studies comparing two different therapeutic modalities (i.e. without a control group). We included studies involving parent\u2010infant dyads in which the parent was experiencing mental health problems, domestic abuse or substance dependency, with or without the infant showing signs of attachment or dysregulation problems, or both attachment and dysregulation problems. We included all infants irrespective of the presence of problems such as low birthweight, prematurity or disabilities. We included studies targeting infants and toddlers in which the mean age of the infant participants was 24 months or less at the point of referral. We included studies targeting all parents (i.e. including fathers, birth parents, adoptive and kinship parents, but not foster parents). We included studies that had evaluated the effectiveness of PIP programmes in which the intervention met all of the following criteria: underpinned by a psychodynamic model that involved making unconscious patterns of relating by targeting the parent\u2010therapist transference; parental internal working models or representations (i.e. the way in which the mother's current view of her infant was affected by interfering representations or unremembered influences from her own history, and to link them to her current functioning, in order to improve the parent\u2010infant relationship directly, thereby facilitating new paths for growth and development for both mother and infant);    delivered jointly to both parent and infant with a focus on the parent\u2010infant relationship/interaction and aimed primarily at improving infant attachment security, socio\u2010emotional functioning, or both, via the parent\u2010infant relationship/interaction;    delivered by a parent\u2010infant psychotherapist/specialist on a dyadic basis or to dyads in groups, in any setting (clinic, hospital or home), over any period of time. underpinned by a psychodynamic model that involved making unconscious patterns of relating by targeting the parent\u2010therapist transference; parental internal working models or representations (i.e. the way in which the mother's current view of her infant was affected by interfering representations or unremembered influences from her own history, and to link them to her current functioning, in order to improve the parent\u2010infant relationship directly, thereby facilitating new paths for growth and development for both mother and infant); delivered jointly to both parent and infant with a focus on the parent\u2010infant relationship/interaction and aimed primarily at improving infant attachment security, socio\u2010emotional functioning, or both, via the parent\u2010infant relationship/interaction; delivered by a parent\u2010infant psychotherapist/specialist on a dyadic basis or to dyads in groups, in any setting (clinic, hospital or home), over any period of time. We also included studies of PIPs that used additional components (i.e. provided they still met the core inclusion criteria). We excluded studies of interventions that were delivered to the parent or parents alone (e.g. interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) or that were dyadic but primarily psychoeducational or based on other therapeutic models (e.g. behavioural or cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)). We excluded studies of stand\u2010alone video\u2010interaction guidance interventions but not studies in which video feedback had been incorporated into a PIP that met the above criteria. We extracted data for the following outcomes at both post\u2010intervention and follow\u2010up, provided they had been measured using a standardised parent\u2010report or independent observation of the type listed as examples for each outcome below. Parental mental health including, for example, depression* (e.g. Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) (Beck 1961); anxiety (e.g. Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) (Beck 1988); parenting stress (e.g. Parenting Stress Index (PSI) (Abidin 1983).

        "title": "Rivastigmine for Alzheimer's disease",
        "abstract": "Background Alzheimer's disease is the commonest cause of dementia affecting older people. One of the therapeutic strategies aimed at ameliorating the clinical manifestations of Alzheimer's disease is to enhance cholinergic neurotransmission in the brain by the use of cholinesterase inhibitors to delay the breakdown of acetylcholine released into synaptic clefts. Tacrine, the first of the cholinesterase inhibitors to undergo extensive trials for this purpose, was associated with significant adverse effects including hepatotoxicity. Other cholinesterase inhibitors, including rivastigmine, with superior properties in terms of specificity of action and lower risk of adverse effects have since been introduced. Rivastigmine has received approval for use in 60 countries including all member states of the European Union and the USA.    Objectives To determine the clinical efficacy and safety of rivastigmine for patients with dementia of Alzheimer's type.    Search methods We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialized Register, on 2 March 2015 using the terms: Rivastigmine OR \u00a0exelon OR ENA OR \"SDZ ENA 713\". ALOIS contains records of clinical trials identified from monthly searches of a number of major healthcare databases (Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS), numerous trial registries and grey literature sources.    Selection criteria We included all unconfounded, double\u2010blind, randomised, controlled trials in which treatment with rivastigmine was administered to patients with dementia of the Alzheimer's type for 12 weeks or more and its effects compared with those of placebo in a parallel group of patients, or where two formulations of rivastigmine were compared.    Data collection and analysis One review author (JSB) applied the study selection criteria, assessed the quality of studies and extracted data.    Main results A total of 13 trials met the inclusion criteria of the review. The trials had a duration of between 12 and 52 weeks. The older trials tested a capsule form with a dose of up to 12 mg/day. Trials reported since 2007 have tested continuous dose transdermal patch formulations delivering 4.6, 9.5 and 17.7 mg/day.  Our main analysis compared the safety and efficacy of rivastigmine 6 to 12 mg/day orally or 9.5 mg/day transdermally with placebo.  Seven trials contributed data from 3450 patients to this analysis. Data from another two studies were not included because of a lack of information and methodological concerns. All the included trials were multicentre trials and recruited patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease with a mean age of about 75 years. All had low risk of bias for randomisation and allocation but the risk of bias due to attrition was unclear in four studies, low in one study and high in two studies.  After 26 weeks of treatment rivastigmine compared to placebo was associated with better outcomes for cognitive function measured with the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale\u2010Cognitive (ADAS\u2010Cog) score (mean difference (MD) \u20101.79; 95% confidence interval (CI) \u20102.21 to \u20101.37, n = 3232, 6 studies) and the Mini\u2010Mental State Examination (MMSE) score (MD 0.74; 95% CI 0.52 to 0.97, n = 3205, 6 studies), activities of daily living (SMD 0.20; 95% CI 0.13 to 0.27, n = 3230, 6 studies) and clinician rated global impression of changes, with a smaller proportion of patients treated with rivastigmine experiencing no change or a deterioration (OR 0.68; 95% CI 0.58 to 0.80, n = 3338, 7 studies).  Three studies reported behavioural change, and there were no differences compared to placebo (standardised mean difference (SMD) \u20100.04; 95% CI \u20100.14 to 0.06, n = 1529, 3 studies). Only one study measured the impact on caregivers using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory\u2010Caregiver Distress (NPI\u2010D) scale and this found no difference between the groups (MD 0.10; 95% CI \u20100.91 to 1.11, n = 529, 1 study). Overall, participants who received rivastigmine were about twice as likely to withdraw from the trials (odds ratio (OR) 2.01, 95% CI 1.71 to 2.37, n = 3569, 7 studies) or to experience an adverse event during the trials (OR 2.16, 95% CI 1.82 to 2.57, n = 3587, 7 studies).    Authors' conclusions Rivastigmine (6 to 12 mg daily orally or 9.5 mg daily transdermally) appears to be beneficial for people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. In comparisons with placebo, better outcomes were observed for rate of decline of cognitive function and activities of daily living, although the effects were small and of uncertain clinical importance. There was also a benefit from rivastigmine on the outcome of clinician's global assessment. There were no differences between the rivastigmine group and placebo group in behavioural change or impact on carers. At these doses the transdermal patch may have fewer side effects than the capsules but has comparable efficacy. The quality of evidence is only moderate for all of the outcomes reviewed because of a risk of bias due to dropouts. All the studies with usable data were industry funded or sponsored. This review has not examined economic data.",

        "title": "Perioperative beta\u2010blockers for preventing surgery\u2010related mortality and morbidity",
        "abstract": "Background Randomized controlled trials have yielded conflicting results regarding the ability of beta\u2010blockers to influence perioperative cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Thus routine prescription of these drugs in unselected patients remains a controversial issue.    Objectives The objective of this review was to systematically analyse the effects of perioperatively administered beta\u2010blockers for prevention of surgery\u2010related mortality and morbidity in patients undergoing any type of surgery while under general anaesthesia.    Search methods We identified trials by searching the following databases from the date of their inception until June 2013: MEDLINE, Embase , the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Biosis Previews, CAB Abstracts, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Derwent Drug File, Science Citation Index Expanded, Life Sciences Collection, Global Health and PASCAL. In addition, we searched online resources to identify grey literature.    Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials if participants were randomly assigned to a beta\u2010blocker group or a control group (standard care or placebo). Surgery (any type) had to be performed with all or at least a significant proportion of participants under general anaesthesia.    Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data from all studies. In cases of disagreement, we reassessed the respective studies to reach consensus. We computed summary estimates in the absence of significant clinical heterogeneity. Risk ratios (RRs) were used for dichotomous outcomes, and mean differences (MDs) were used for continuous outcomes. We performed subgroup analyses for various potential effect modifiers.    Main results We included 88 randomized controlled trials with 19,161 participants. Six studies (7%) met the highest methodological quality criteria (studies with overall low risk of bias: adequate sequence generation, adequate allocation concealment, double/triple\u2010blinded design with a placebo group, intention\u2010to\u2010treat analysis), whereas in the remaining trials, some form of bias was present or could not be definitively excluded (studies with overall unclear or high risk of bias). Outcomes were evaluated separately for cardiac and non\u2010cardiac surgery.  CARDIAC SURGERY (53 trials)  We found no clear evidence of an effect  of beta\u2010blockers on the following outcomes.  \u2022 All\u2010cause mortality:  RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.52, 3783 participants, moderate quality evidence.  \u2022 Acute myocardial infarction (AMI):  RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.51, 3553 participants, moderate quality evidence.  \u2022 Myocardial ischaemia:  RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.05, 166 participants, low quality evidence.  \u2022 Cerebrovascular events:  RR 1.52, 95% CI 0.58 to 4.02, 1400 participants, low quality evidence.  \u2022 Hypotension:  RR 1.54, 95% CI 0.67 to 3.51, 558 participants, low quality evidence.  \u2022 Bradycardia:  RR 1.61, 95% CI 0.97 to 2.66, 660 participants, low quality evidence.  \u2022 Congestive heart failure:  RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.34, 311 participants, low quality evidence.  Beta\u2010blockers significantly reduced  the occurrence of the following endpoints.  \u2022 Ventricular arrhythmias:  RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.58, number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 29, 2292 participants, moderate quality evidence.  \u2022 Supraventricular arrhythmias:  RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.53, NNTB five, 6420 participants, high quality evidence.  \u2022 On average, beta\u2010blockers reduced length of hospital stay  by 0.54 days (95% CI \u20100.90 to \u20100.19, 2450 participants, low quality evidence).  NON\u2010CARDIAC SURGERY (35 trials)  Beta\u2010blockers significantly increased  the occurrence of the following adverse events.  \u2022 All\u2010cause mortality:  RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.57, 11,413 participants, low quality of evidence, number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 167.  \u2022 Hypotension:  RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.38 to 1.64, NNTH 16, 10,947 participants, high quality evidence.  \u2022 Bradycardia:  RR 2.23, 95% CI 1.48 to 3.36, NNTH 21, 11,033 participants, moderate quality evidence.  We found a potential increase  in the occurrence of the following outcomes with the use of beta\u2010blockers.  \u2022 Cerebrovascular events:  RR 1.59, 95% CI 0.93 to 2.71, 9150 participants, low quality evidence.  Whereas no clear evidence of an effect was found when all studies were analysed, restricting the meta\u2010analysis to low risk of bias studies revealed a significant increase in cerebrovascular events with the use of beta\u2010blockers: RR 2.09, 95% CI 1.14 to 3.82, NNTH 265, 8648 participants.  Beta\u2010blockers significantly reduced  the occurrence of the following endpoints.  \u2022 AMI:  RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.87, NNTB 76, 10,958 participants, high quality evidence.  \u2022 Myocardial ischaemia:  RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.77, NNTB nine, 978 participants, moderate quality evidence.  \u2022 Supraventricular arrhythmias:  RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.94, NNTB 112, 8744 participants, high quality evidence.  We found no clear evidence of an effect  of beta\u2010blockers on the following outcomes.  \u2022 Ventricular arrhythmias:  RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.49, 476 participants, moderate quality evidence.  \u2022 Congestive heart failure:  RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.48, 9173 participants, moderate quality evidence.  \u2022 Length of hospital stay:  mean difference \u20100.45 days, 95% CI \u20101.75 to 0.84, 551 participants, low quality evidence.    Authors' conclusions According to our findings, perioperative application of beta\u2010blockers still plays a pivotal role in cardiac surgery , as they can substantially reduce the high burden of supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias in the aftermath of surgery. Their influence on mortality, AMI, stroke, congestive heart failure, hypotension and bradycardia in this setting remains unclear.  In non\u2010cardiac surgery,  evidence shows an association of beta\u2010blockers with increased all\u2010cause mortality. Data from low risk of bias trials further suggests an increase in stroke rate with the use of beta\u2010blockers. As the quality of evidence is still low to moderate, more evidence is needed before a definitive conclusion can be drawn. The substantial reduction in supraventricular arrhythmias and AMI in this setting seems to be offset by the potential increase in mortality and stroke.",

As opposed to these eligibility criteria as defined in the protocol (Wiesbauer 2007), we decided to consider trials in our meta\u2010analysis that partially included patients not receiving general anaesthesia. Trials had to fulfil the following criteria to be eligible for inclusion: more than 100 randomly assigned participants operated on under general anaesthesia, or more than 70% of participants receiving general anaesthesia. We came to this conclusion, as we believed that a meta\u2010analysis without data from the POISE (Perioperative Ischemia Evaluation Study), DIPOM (Diabetic Postoperative Mortality and Morbidity) or MaVS (Metoprolol After Vascular Surgery) trial would not find enough credibility within the clinical community.

We included studies that looked at the effects of beta\u2010blockers on adults 18 years of age or older undergoing any type of surgery while under general anaesthesia. As opposed to these eligibility criteria as defined in the protocol (Wiesbauer 2007), we decided to consider trials in our meta\u2010analysis that partially included patients not receiving general anaesthesia. Trials had to fulfil the following criteria to be eligible for inclusion: more than 100 randomly assigned participants operated on under general anaesthesia, or more than 70% of participants receiving general anaesthesia. We came to this conclusion, as we believed that a meta\u2010analysis without data from the POISE (Perioperative Ischemia Evaluation Study), DIPOM (Diabetic Postoperative Mortality and Morbidity) or MaVS (Metoprolol After Vascular Surgery) trial would not find enough credibility within the clinical community.

        "title": "Music for stress and anxiety reduction in coronary heart disease patients",
        "abstract": "Background Individuals with coronary heart disease (CHD) often suffer from severe distress due to diagnosis, hospitalization, surgical procedures, uncertainty of outcome, fear of dying, doubts about progress in recovery, helplessness and loss of control. Such adverse effects put the cardiac patient at greater risk for complications, including sudden cardiac death. It is therefore of crucial importance that the care of people with CHD focuses on psychological as well as physiological needs.  Music interventions have been used to reduce anxiety and distress and improve physiological functioning in medical patients; however its efficacy for people with CHD needs to be evaluated.    Objectives To update the previously published review that examined the effects of music interventions with standard care versus standard care alone on psychological and physiological responses in persons with CHD.    Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) on The Cochrane Library (2012, Issue 10), MEDLINE (OvidSP, 1950 to October week 4 2012), EMBASE (OvidSP, 1974 to October week 5 2012), CINAHL (EBSCOhost, 1982 to 9 November 2012), PsycINFO (OvidSP, 1806 to October week 5 2012), LILACS (Virtual Health Library, 1982 to 15 November 2012), Social Science Citation Index (ISI, 1974 to 9 November 2012), a number of other databases, and clinical trial registers. We also conducted handsearching of journals and reference lists. We applied no language restrictions.    Selection criteria We included all randomized controlled trials and quasi\u2010randomized trials that compared music interventions and standard care with standard care alone for persons with confirmed CHD.    Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed methodological quality, seeking additional information from the trial researchers when necessary. We present results using weighted mean differences for outcomes measured by the same scale, and standardized mean differences for outcomes measured by different scales. We used post\u2010intervention scores. In cases of significant baseline difference, we used change scores (changes from baseline).    Main results We identified four new trials for this update. In total, the evidence for this review rests on 26 trials (1369 participants). Listening to music was the main intervention used, and 23 of the studies did not include a trained music therapist.  Results indicate that music interventions have a small beneficial effect on psychological distress in people with CHD and this effect is consistent across studies (MD = \u20101.26, 95% CI \u20102.30 to \u20100.22, P = 0.02, I\u00b2 = 0%). Listening to music has a moderate effect on anxiety in people with CHD; however results were inconsistent across studies (SMD = \u20100.70, 95% CI \u20101.17 to \u20100.22, P = 0.004, I\u00b2 = 77%). Studies that used music interventions in people with myocardial infarction found more consistent anxiety\u2010reducing effects of music, with an average anxiety reduction of 5.87 units on a 20 to 80 point score range (95% CI \u20107.99 to \u20103.75, P < 0.00001, I\u00b2 = 53%). Furthermore, studies that used patient\u2010selected music resulted in greater anxiety\u2010reducing effects that were consistent across studies (SMD = \u20100.89, 95% CI \u20101.42 to \u20100.36, P = 0.001, I\u00b2 = 48%). Findings indicate that listening to music reduces heart rate (MD = \u20103.40, 95% CI \u20106.12 to \u20100.69, P = 0.01), respiratory rate (MD = \u20102.50, 95% CI \u20103.61 to \u20101.39, P < 0.00001) and systolic blood pressure (MD = \u20105.52 mmHg, 95% CI \u2010 7.43 to \u20103.60, P < 0.00001). Studies that included two or more music sessions led to a small and consistent pain\u2010reducing effect (SMD = \u20100.27, 95% CI \u20100.55 to \u20100.00, P = 0.05). The results also suggest that listening to music may improve patients' quality of sleep following a cardiac procedure or surgery (SMD = 0.91, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.79, P = 0.04).  We found no strong evidence for heart rate variability and depression. Only one study considered hormone levels and quality of life as an outcome variable. A small number of studies pointed to a possible beneficial effect of music on opioid intake after cardiac procedures or surgery, but more research is needed to strengthen this evidence.    Authors' conclusions This systematic review indicates that listening to music may have a beneficial effect on anxiety in persons with CHD, especially those with a myocardial infarction. Anxiety\u2010reducing effects appear to be greatest when people are given a choice of which music to listen to.  Furthermore, listening to music may have a beneficial effect on systolic blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, quality of sleep and pain in persons with CHD. However, the clinical significance of these findings is unclear. Since many of the studies are at high risk of bias, these findings need to be interpreted with caution. More research is needed into the effects of music interventions offered by a trained music therapist.",

        "title": "Sulfasalazine for ankylosing spondylitis",
        "abstract": "Background Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of unknown cause and affects mainly the spine, but can also affect other joints. Disease progression may result in loss of mobility and function. Sulfasalazine is a disease\u2010modifying antirheumatic drug used in the treatment of AS. However, its efficacy remains unclear. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2005.    Objectives To evaluate the benefits and harms of sulfasalazine for the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis (AS).    Search methods We searched for relevant randomized and quasi\u2010randomized trials in any language, using the following sources: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue\u00a011); MEDLINE (2003 to 28 November 2013); EMBASE (2003 to 27 November 2013); CINAHL (2003 to 28 November 2013); Ovid MEDLINE data, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (28 November 2013); and the reference sections of retrieved articles.    Selection criteria We evaluated randomized and quasi\u2010randomized trials examining the benefits and harms of sulfasalazine on AS.    Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently reviewed unblinded trial reports according to the selection criteria. Disagreements on the inclusion of the studies were resolved, when necessary, by recourse to a third review author. The same authors independently assessed the risk of bias of included trials and entered the data extracted from the included trials. We combined results using mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous data, and risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous data.  We restructured outcome measures for this update based on recommendations from the editorial group. Major outcomes included: pain, Bath ankylosing spondylitis disease activity index (BASDAI), Bath ankylosing spondylitis function index (BASFI), Bath ankylosing spondylitis metrology index (BASMI), radiographic progression, total number of withdrawals due to adverse events, and serious adverse events.    Main results We did not add any new studies to this review following the updated search. In the original review, we included 11 studies in the analysis, involving 895 participants in total. All included studies compared sulfasalazine with placebo. We judged most of the studies as low risk of bias or unclear risk of bias in five domains (random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessment, selective reporting, and other sources of bias). However, for incomplete outcome data, we only judged one trial at low risk of bias.  None of the included trials assessed BASDAI, BASFI, BASMI or radiographic progression. Different parameters were used to assess pain. The pooled MD for back pain measured on a 0 to 100 mm visual analogue scale was \u20102.96 (95% confidence interval (CI) \u20106.33 to 0.41; absolute risk difference 3%, 95% CI 1% to 6%; 6 trials). Compared to placebo, a significantly higher rate of withdrawals due to adverse effects (RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.15; absolute risk difference 4%, 95% CI 0.4% to 8.8%; 11 trials) was found in the sulfasalazine group. A serious adverse reaction was reported in one patient taking sulfasalazine (Peto odds ratio 7.50, 95% CI 0.15 to 378.16).    Authors' conclusions There is not enough evidence to support any benefit of sulfasalazine in reducing pain, disease activity, radiographic progression, or improving physical function and spinal mobility in the treatment of AS. A statistically significant benefit in reducing the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and easing spinal stiffness was mentioned in the previous version. However, the effect size was very small and not clinically meaningful. More withdrawals because of side effects occurred with sulfasalazine. Further studies, with larger sample sizes, longer duration, and using validated outcome measures are needed to verify the uncertainty of sulfasalazine in AS.",

They usually involve judgment or some method of non\u2010random categorization of participants, for example:     Allocation by judgment of the clinician   Allocation by preference of the participant   Allocation based on the results of a laboratory test or a series of tests   Allocation by availability of the intervention        Criteria for the judgment of 'UNCLEAR' (uncertain risk of bias)   Insufficient information about the sequence generation process to permit judgment of 'Yes' or 'No'               ALLOCATION CONCEALMENT  Was allocation adequately concealed? [Short form: Allocation concealment?]      Criteria for a judgment of 'YES' (i.e. low risk of bias)   Participants and investigators enrolling participants could not foresee assignment because one of the following, or an equivalent method, was used to conceal allocation:     Central allocation (including telephone, web\u2010based, and pharmacy\u2010controlled, randomisation)   Sequentially numbered drug containers of identical appearance   Sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes    \u00a0     Criteria for the judgment of 'NO' (i.e. high risk of bias)   Participants or investigators enrolling participants could possibly foresee assignments and thus introduce selection bias, such as allocation based on:     Using an open random allocation schedule (e.g. a list of random numbers)   Assignment envelopes were used without appropriate safeguards (e.g. if envelopes were unsealed or non\u2010opaque or not sequentially numbered)    Alternation or rotation   Date of birth   Case record number   Any other explicitly unconcealed procedure        Criteria for the judgment of 'UNCLEAR' (uncertain risk of bias)   Insufficient information to permit judgment of 'Yes' or 'No'. This is usually the case if the method of concealment is not described or not described in sufficient detail to allow a definite judgment \u00a8C for example if the use of assignment envelopes is described, but it remains unclear whether envelopes were sequentially numbered, opaque and sealed               BLINDING OF PARTICIPANTS, PERSONNEL AND OUTCOME ASSESSORS  Was knowledge of the allocated interventions adequately prevented during the study? [Short form: Blinding?]      Criteria for a judgment of 'YES' (i.e. low risk of bias)   Any one of the following:    No blinding, but the review authors judge that the outcome and the outcome measurement are not likely to be influenced by lack of blinding    Blinding of participants and key study personnel ensured, and unlikely that the blinding could have been broken    Either participants or some key study personnel were not blinded, but outcome assessment was blinded and the non\u2010blinding of others unlikely to introduce bias         Criteria for the judgment of 'NO' (i.e. high risk of bias)   Any one of the following:    No blinding or incomplete blinding, and the outcome or outcome measurement is likely to be influenced by lack of blinding    Blinding of key study participants and personnel attempted, but likely that the blinding could have been broken    Either participants or some key study personnel were not blinded, and the non\u2010blinding of others likely to introduce bias         Criteria for the judgment of 'UNCLEAR' (uncertain risk of bias)   Any one of the following:    Insufficient information to permit judgment of 'Yes' or 'No'   The study did not address this outcome                 INCOMPLETE OUTCOME DATA  Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed? [Short form: Incomplete outcome data addressed?]      Criteria for a judgment of 'YES' (i.e. low risk of bias)   Any one of the following:    No missing outcome data   Reasons for missing outcome data unlikely to be related to true outcome (for survival data, censoring unlikely to be introducing bias)    Missing outcome data balanced in numbers across intervention groups, with similar reasons for missing data across groups    For dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcomes compared with observed event risk not enough to have a clinically relevant impact on the intervention effect estimate    For continuous outcome data, plausible effect size (difference in means or standardized difference in means) among missing outcomes not enough to have a clinically relevant impact on observed effect size    Missing data have been imputed using appropriate methods        Criteria for the judgment of 'NO' (i.e. high risk of bias)   Any one of the following:    Reason for missing outcome data likely to be related to true outcome, with either imbalance in numbers or reasons for missing data across intervention groups    For dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcomes compared with observed event risk enough to induce clinically relevant bias in intervention effect estimate    For continuous outcome data, plausible effect size (difference in means or standardized difference in means) among missing outcomes enough to induce clinically relevant bias in observed effect size    'As\u2010treated' analysis done with substantial departure of the intervention received from that assigned at randomisation    Potentially inappropriate application of simple imputation        Criteria for the judgment of 'UNCLEAR' (uncertain risk of bias)   Any one of the following:    Insufficient reporting of attrition/exclusions to permit judgment of 'Yes' or 'No' (e.g. number randomized not stated, no reasons for missing data provided)    The study did not address this outcome                 SELECTIVE OUTCOME REPORTING  Are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting? [Short form: Free of selective reporting?]      Criteria for a judgment of 'YES' (i.e. low risk of bias)   Any of the following:    The study protocol is available and all of the study's prespecified (primary and secondary) outcomes that are of interest in the review have been reported in the prespecified way    The study protocol is not available but it is clear that the published reports include all expected outcomes, including those that were prespecified (convincing text of this nature may be uncommon)         Criteria for the judgment of 'NO' (i.e. high risk of bias)   Any one of the following:    Not all of the study's prespecified primary outcomes have been reported   One or more primary outcomes is reported using measurements, analysis methods or subsets of the data (e.g. subscales) that were not prespecified    One or more reported primary outcomes were not prespecified (unless clear justification for their reporting is provided, such as an unexpected adverse effect)    One or more outcomes of interest in the review are reported incompletely so that they cannot be entered in a meta\u2010analysis    The study report fails to include results for a key outcome that would be expected to have been reported for such a study         Criteria for the judgment of 'UNCLEAR' (uncertain risk of bias)   Insufficient information to permit judgment of 'Yes' or 'No'.

        "title": "Amiodarone versus other pharmacological interventions for prevention of sudden cardiac death",
        "abstract": "Background Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is one of the main causes of cardiac death. There are two main strategies to prevent it: managing cardiovascular risk factors and reducing the risk of ventricular arrhythmias. Implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs) constitute the standard therapy for both primary and secondary prevention; however, they are not widely available in settings with limited resources. The antiarrhythmic amiodarone has been proposed as an alternative to ICD.    Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of amiodarone for primary or secondary prevention in SCD compared with placebo or no intervention or any other antiarrhythmic drugs in participants at high risk (primary prevention) or who have recovered from a cardiac arrest or a syncope due to Ventricular Tachycardia/Ventricular Fibrillation, or VT/VF (secondary prevention).    Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (OVID), EMBASE (OVID), CINAHL (EBSCO) and LILACS on 26 March 2015. We reviewed reference lists of included studies and selected reviews on the topic, contacted authors of included studies, screened relevant meetings and searched in registers for ongoing trials. We applied no language restrictions.    Selection criteria Randomised and quasi\u2010randomised trials assessing the efficacy of amiodarone versus placebo, no intervention, or other antiarrhythmics in adults. For primary prevention we considered participants at high risk for SCD. For secondary prevention we considered participants recovered from cardiac arrest or syncope due to ventricular arrhythmias.    Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed the trials for inclusion and extracted relevant data. We contacted trial authors for missing data. We performed meta\u2010analyses using a random\u2010effects model. We calculated risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Three studies included more than one comparison.    Main results We included 24 studies (9,997 participants). Eighteen studies evaluated amiodarone for primary prevention and six for secondary prevention. Only three studies used an ICD concomitantly with amiodarone for the comparison (all of them for secondary prevention).  For primary prevention, amiodarone compared to placebo or no intervention (17 studies, 8383 participants) reduced SCD (RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.66 to 0.88), cardiac mortality (RR 0.86; 95% CI 0.77 to 0.96) and all\u2010cause mortality (RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.00). The quality of the evidence was low.  Compared to other antiarrhythmics (three studies, 540 participants), amiodarone reduced SCD (RR 0.44; 95% CI 0.19 to 1.00), cardiac mortality (RR 0.41; 95% CI 0.20 to 0.86) and all\u2010cause mortality (RR 0.37; 95% CI 0.18 to 0.76). The quality of the evidence was moderate.  For secondary prevention, amiodarone compared to placebo or no intervention (two studies, 440 participants) appeared to increase the risk of SCD (RR 4.32; 95% CI 0.87 to 21.49) and all\u2010cause mortality (RR 3.05; 1.33 to 7.01). However, the quality of the evidence was very low. Compared to other antiarrhythmics (four studies, 839 participants) amiodarone appeared to increase the risk of SCD (RR 1.40; 95% CI 0.56 to 3.52; very low quality of evidence), but there was no effect in all\u2010cause mortality (RR 1.03; 95% CI 0.75 to 1.42; low quality evidence).  Amiodarone was associated with an increase in pulmonary and thyroid adverse events.   Authors' conclusions There is low to moderate quality evidence that amiodarone reduces SCD, cardiac and all\u2010cause mortality when compared to placebo or no intervention for primary prevention, and its effects are superior to other antiarrhythmics.  It is uncertain if amiodarone reduces or increases SCD and mortality for secondary prevention because the quality of the evidence was very low.",

        "title": "Calcium supplementation for prevention of primary hypertension",
        "abstract": "Background Hypertension is a major public health problem that increases the risk of cardiovascular and kidney diseases. Several studies have shown an inverse association between calcium intake and blood pressure, as small reductions in blood pressure have been shown to produce rapid reductions in vascular disease risk even in individuals with normal blood pressure ranges. This is the first update of the\u00a0review\u00a0to evaluate the effect of calcium supplementation in normotensive individuals as a preventive health measure.    Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of calcium supplementation versus placebo or control for reducing blood pressure in normotensive people and for the prevention\u00a0of primary hypertension.    Search methods The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to September 2020: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, CENTRAL (2020, Issue 9), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and the\u00a0US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. The searches had no language restrictions.    Selection criteria We selected trials that randomised normotensive people to dietary calcium interventions such as supplementation or food fortification versus placebo or control. We excluded quasi\u2010random designs. The primary outcomes were hypertension (defined as blood pressure \u2265 140/90 mmHg) and blood pressure measures.    Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, abstracted the data and assessed the risks of bias. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence.    Main results The 2020 updated search identified four new trials. We included a total of 20 trials with 3512 participants, however we only included 18 for the meta\u2010analysis with 3140 participants. None of the studies reported hypertension as a dichotomous outcome. The effect on systolic and diastolic blood pressure was: mean difference (MD) \u20101.37 mmHg, 95% confidence interval (CI) \u20102.08, \u20100.66; 3140 participants; 18 studies; I2 = 0%, high\u2010certainty evidence; and MD \u20101.45, 95% CI \u20102.23, \u20100.67; 3039 participants; 17 studies; I2 = 45%, high\u2010certainty evidence, respectively. The effect on systolic and diastolic blood pressure for those younger than 35 years was: MD \u20101.86, 95% CI \u20103.45, \u20100.27; 452 participants; eight\u00a0studies; I2 = 19%, moderate\u2010certainty evidence; MD \u20102.50, 95% CI \u20104.22, \u20100.79; 351 participants; seven\u00a0studies ; I2 = 54%, moderate\u2010certainty evidence, respectively. The effect on systolic and diastolic blood pressure for those 35 years or older was: MD \u20100.97, 95% CI \u20101.83, \u20100.10; 2688 participants; 10 studies; I2 = 0%, high\u2010certainty evidence; MD \u20100.59, 95% CI \u20101.13, \u20100.06; 2688 participants; 10 studies; I2 = 0%, high\u2010certainty evidence, respectively. The effect on systolic and diastolic blood pressure for women was: MD \u20101.25, 95% CI \u20102.53, 0.03; 1915 participants; eight studies; I2 = 0%, high\u2010certainty evidence; MD \u20101.04, 95% CI \u20101.86, \u20100.22; 1915 participants; eight studies; I2 = 4%, high\u2010certainty evidence, respectively. The effect on systolic and diastolic blood pressure for men was MD \u20102.14, 95% CI \u20103.71, \u20100.59; 507 participants; five studies; I2 = 8%, moderate\u2010certainty evidence; MD \u20101.99, 95% CI \u20103.25, \u20100.74; 507 participants; five studies; I2 = 41%, moderate\u2010certainty evidence, respectively. The effect was consistent in both genders regardless of baseline calcium intake.  The effect on systolic blood pressure was: MD \u20100.02, 95% CI \u20102.23, 2.20; 302 participants; 3 studies; I2 = 0%, moderate\u2010certainty evidence with doses less than 1000 mg; MD \u20101.05, 95% CI \u20101.91, \u20100.19; 2488 participants; 9 studies; I2 = 0%, high\u2010certainty evidence with doses 1000 to 1500 mg; and MD \u20102.79, 95% CI \u20104.71, 0.86; 350 participants; 7 studies; I2 = 0%, moderate\u2010certainty evidence with doses more than 1500 mg. The effect on diastolic blood pressure was: MD \u20100.41, 95% CI \u20102.07, 1.25; 201 participants; 2 studies; I2 = 0, moderate\u2010certainty evidence; MD \u20102.03, 95% CI \u20103.44, \u20100.62 ; 1017 participants; 8 studies; and MD \u20101.35, 95% CI \u20102.75, \u20100.05; 1821 participants; 8 studies; I2 = 51%, high\u2010certainty evidence, respectively.  None of the studies reported adverse events.   Authors' conclusions An increase in calcium intake slightly reduces both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in normotensive people, particularly in young people, suggesting a role in the prevention of hypertension. The effect across multiple prespecified subgroups and a possible dose response effect reinforce this conclusion. Even small reductions in blood pressure could have important health implications for reducing vascular disease. A 2 mmHg lower systolic blood pressure is predicted to produce about 10% lower stroke mortality and about 7% lower mortality from ischaemic heart disease.  There is a great need for adequately\u2010powered clinical trials randomising young people. Subgroup analysis should involve basal calcium intake, age, sex, basal blood pressure, and body mass index. We also require assessment of side effects, optimal doses and the best strategy to improve calcium intake.",

        "abstract": "Background Patients undergoing neurosurgery are at risk of cerebral ischaemia with resultant cerebral hypoxia and neuronal cell death. This can increase both the risk of mortality and long term neurological disability. Induced hypothermia has been shown to reduce the risk of cerebral ischaemic damage in both animal studies and in humans who have been resuscitated following cardiac arrest. This had lead to an increasing interest in its neuroprotective potential in neurosurgical patients. This review was originally published in 2011 and did not find any evidence of either effectiveness or harm in these patients. This updated review was designed to capture current evidence to readdress these issues.    Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness and safety profile of induced hypothermia versus normothermia for neuroprotection in patients undergoing brain surgery. Effectiveness was to be measured in terms of short and long term mortality and functional neurological outcomes. Safety was to be assessed in terms of the rate of the adverse events infection, myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke, congestive cardiac failure and any other adverse events reported by the authors of the included studies.    Search methods For the original review, the authors searched the databases Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (OvidSP), EMBASE (OvidSP) and LILACS to November 2010. For the updated review all these databases were re\u2010searched from November 2010 to May 2014.  For both the original and updated versions, grey literature was sought by searching reference lists of identified studies and relevant review articles, and conference proceedings. No language restrictions were applied.    Selection criteria As in the original review, we included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of induced hypothermia versus normothermia for neuroprotection in patients of any age and gender undergoing brain surgery, which addressed mortality, neurological morbidity or adverse event outcomes.    Data collection and analysis Three review authors independently extracted data and two independently assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. Any discrepancies were resolved by discussion between authors.    Main results In this updated review, one new ongoing study was found but no new eligible completed studies were identified. This update was therefore conducted using the same four studies included in the original review. These studies included a total of 1219 participants, mean age 40 to 54 years. All included studies were reported as RCTs. Two were multicentred, together including a total of 1114 patients who underwent cerebral aneurysm clipping, and were judged to have an overall low risk of bias. The other two studies were single centred. One included 80 patients who had a craniotomy following severe traumatic brain injury and was judged to have an unclear or low risk of bias. The other study included 25 patients who underwent hemicranicectomy to relieve oedema following cerebral infarction and was judged to have an unclear or high risk of bias. All studies assessed hypothermia versus normothermia. Overall 608 participants received hypothermia with target temperatures ranging from 32.5 \u00b0C to 35 \u00b0C, and 611 were assigned to normothermia with the actual temperatures recorded in this group ranging form 36.5 \u00b0C to 38 \u00b0C. For those who were cooled, 556 had cooling commenced immediately after induction of anaesthesia that was continued until the surgical objective of aneurysm clipping was achieved, and 52 had cooling commenced immediately after surgery and continued for 48 to 96 hours.  Pooled estimates of effect were calculated for the outcomes mortality during treatment or follow\u2010up (ranging from in\u2010hospital to one year); neurological outcome measured in terms of the Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS) of 3 or less; and adverse events of infections, myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke and congestive cardiac failure. With regards to mortality, the risk of dying if allocated to hypothermia compared to normothermia was not statistically significantly different (risk ratio (RR) 0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 1.27, P = 0.47). There was no indication that the time at which cooling was started affected the risk of dying (RR with intraoperative cooling 0.95, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.51, P = 0.83; RR for cooling postoperatively 0.67, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.35, P = 0.26). For the neurological outcome, the risk of having a poor outcome with a GOS of 3 or less was not statistically different in those who received hypothermia versus normothermia (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.04, P = 0.09). Again there was no indication that the time at which cooling was started affected this result. Regarding adverse events, there was no statistically significant difference in the incidence in those allocated to hypothermia versus normothermia for risk of surgical infection (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.97, P = 0.48), myocardial infarction (RR 1.86, 95% CI 0.69 to 4.98, P = 0.22), ischaemic stroke (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.05, P = 0.24) or congestive heart failure (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.21, P = 0.38). In contrast to other outcomes, where time of application of cooling did not change the statistical significance of the effect estimates, there was a weak statistically significant increased risk of infection in those who were cooled postoperatively versus those who were not cooled (RR 1.77, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.98, P = 0.03). Overall, as in the original review, no evidence was found that the use of induced hypothermia was either beneficial or harmful in patients undergoing neurosurgery.    Authors' conclusions We found no evidence that the use of induced hypothermia was associated with a significant reduction in mortality or severe neurological disability, or an increase in harm in patients undergoing neurosurgery.",

        "title": "Second\u2010generation antidepressants for preventing seasonal affective disorder in adults",
        "abstract": "Background Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a seasonal pattern of recurrent major depressive episodes that most commonly occurs during autumn or winter and remits in spring. The prevalence of SAD ranges from 1.5% to 9%, depending on latitude. The predictable seasonal aspect of SAD provides a promising opportunity for prevention. This review \u2010 one of four reviews on efficacy and safety of interventions to prevent SAD \u2010 focuses on second\u2010generation antidepressants (SGAs).    Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of SGAs (in comparison with other SGAs, placebo, light therapy, melatonin or agomelatine, psychological therapies or lifestyle interventions) in preventing SAD and improving patient\u2010centred outcomes among adults with a history of SAD.    Search methods We searched Ovid MEDLINE (1950\u2010 ), Embase (1974\u2010 ), PsycINFO (1967\u2010 ) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to 19 June 2018. An earlier search of these databases was conducted via the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trial Register (CCMD\u2010CTR) (all years to 11 August 2015). Furthermore, we searched the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database and international trial registers (to 19 June 2018). We also conducted a grey literature search and handsearched the reference lists of included studies and pertinent review articles.    Selection criteria For efficacy, we included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on adults with a history of winter\u2010type SAD who were free of symptoms at the beginning of the study. For adverse events, we planned to include non\u2010randomised studies. Eligible studies compared a SGA versus another SGA, placebo, light therapy, psychological therapy, melatonin, agomelatine or lifestyle changes. We also intended to compare SGAs in combination with any of the comparator interventions versus placebo or the same comparator intervention as monotherapy.    Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened abstracts and full\u2010text publications, extracted data and assessed risk of bias of included studies. When data were sufficient, we conducted random\u2010effects (Mantel\u2010Haenszel) meta\u2010analyses. We assessed statistical heterogeneity by calculating the Chi2 statistic and the Cochran Q. We used the I2 statistic to estimate the magnitude of heterogeneity. We assessed publication bias by using funnel plots.We rated the strength of the evidence using the system developed by the GRADE Working Group.    Main results We identified 3745 citations after de\u2010duplication of search results and excluded 3619 records during title and abstract reviews. We assessed 126 full\u2010text papers for inclusion in the review, of which four publications (on three RCTs) providing data from 1100 people met eligibility criteria for this review. All three RCTs had methodological limitations due to high attrition rates.  Overall, moderate\u2010quality evidence indicates that bupropion XL is an efficacious intervention for prevention of recurrence of depressive episodes in people with a history of SAD (risk ratio (RR) 0.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 0.72; 3 RCTs, 1100 participants). However, bupropion XL leads to greater risk of headaches (moderate\u2010quality evidence), insomnia and nausea (both low\u2010quality evidence) when compared with placebo. Numbers needed to treat for additional beneficial outcomes (NNTBs) vary by baseline risks. For a population with a yearly recurrence rate of 30%, the NNTB is 8 (95% CI 6 to 12). For populations with yearly recurrence rates of 50% and 60%, NNTBs are 5 (95% CI 4 to 7) and 4 (95% CI 3 to 6), respectively.  We could find no studies on other SGAs and no studies comparing SGAs with other interventions of interest, such as light therapy, psychological therapies, melatonin or agomelatine.    Authors' conclusions Available evidence indicates that bupropion XL is an effective intervention for prevention of recurrence of SAD. Nevertheless, even in a high\u2010risk population, three out of four people will not benefit from preventive treatment with bupropion XL and will be at risk for harm. Clinicians need to discuss with patients advantages and disadvantages of preventive SGA treatment, and might want to consider offering other potentially efficacious interventions, which might confer a lower risk of adverse events. Given the lack of comparative evidence, the decision for or against initiating preventive treatment of SAD and the treatment selected should be strongly based on patient preferences.  Future researchers need to assess the effectiveness and risk of harms of SGAs other than bupropion for prevention of SAD. Investigators also need to compare benefits and harms of pharmacological and non\u2010pharmacological interventions.",

Timing of outcome assessment Depending on available data, we planned to synthesise outcomes at different time points (e.g. short\u2010term, medium\u2010term and long\u2010term) throughout an entire six\u2010month period of risk during an autumn/winter season.    Hierarchy of outcome measures Our main focus was patient\u2010centred outcomes (i.e. outcomes that patients notice and care about). If several measures assessed the same outcome, we consulted with clinical experts a priori regarding the validity and reliability of individual outcome measures and prioritised accordingly. "

        "title": "Music therapy for autistic people",
        "abstract": "Background Social interaction and social communication are among the central areas of difficulty for autistic people. Music therapy uses music experiences and the relationships that develop through them to enable communication and expression, thus attempting to address some of the core problems of autistic people. Music therapy has been applied in autism since the early 1950s, but its availability to autistic individuals varies across countries and settings.\u00a0The application of music therapy requires specialised academic and clinical training which enables therapists to tailor the intervention to the specific needs of the individual. The present version of this review on music therapy for autistic people is an update of the previous Cochrane review update published in 2014 (following the original Cochrane review published in 2006).    Objectives To review the effects of music therapy, or music therapy added to standard care, for autistic people.    Search methods In \u00a0August 2021, we searched \u00a0CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, eleven other databases and two trials registers. We also ran citation searches, checked reference lists, and contacted study authors to identify additional studies.    Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi\u2010randomised trials and controlled clinical trials comparing music therapy (or music therapy alongside standard care) to 'placebo' therapy, no treatment, or standard care for people with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder were considered for inclusion.    Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Four\u00a0authors independently selected studies\u00a0and extracted data from all included studies. We synthesised the results of included studies in meta\u2010analyses.\u00a0Four authors\u00a0independently assessed risk of bias (RoB) of each included study using the original RoB tool as well as\u00a0the certainty of evidence using GRADE. \u00a0    Main results We included 16 new studies in this update which brought the total number of included studies to 26\u00a0(1165 participants). These studies examined the short\u2010 and medium\u2010term effect of music therapy (intervention duration: three days to eight months) for autistic people in individual or group settings. More than half of the studies were conducted in North America or Asia. Twenty\u2010one studies included children aged from two to\u00a012 years. Five studies included children and adolescents, and/or young adults. Severity levels, language skills, and cognition were widely variable across studies.  Measured immediately post\u2010intervention, music therapy compared with 'placebo' therapy or standard care was more likely to positively effect global improvement (risk ratio (RR)\u00a01.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06 to 1.40;\u00a08 studies, 583 participants;\u00a0moderate\u2010certainty evidence; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) = 11 for low\u2010risk population, 95% CI 6 to 39;\u00a0NNTB = 6 for high\u2010risk population, 95% CI 3\u00a0to 21) and to slightly increase quality of life (SMD 0.28, 95% CI 0.06\u00a0to 0.49; 3 RCTs, 340 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence, small to medium effect size). In addition, music therapy probably results in a large reduction in total autism symptom severity (SMD \u22120.83, 95% CI \u22121.41\u00a0to \u22120.24; 9 studies, 575 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence).\u00a0No clear evidence of a difference between music therapy and comparison groups at immediately post\u2010intervention was found for social interaction (SMD 0.26, 95% CI \u22120.05\u00a0to 0.57, 12 studies, 603 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence); non\u2010verbal communication (SMD 0.26, 95% CI \u22120.03\u00a0to 0.55; 7 RCTs, 192 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence); and verbal communication (SMD 0.30, 95% CI \u22120.18\u00a0to 0.78; 8 studies, 276 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence). Two studies investigated adverse events with one (36 participants) reporting no adverse events; the other study found no differences between music therapy and standard care immediately post\u2010intervention (RR 1.52, 95% CI 0.39 to 5.94; 1 study, 290 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence).\u00a0    Authors' conclusions The findings of this updated review provide evidence that music therapy is probably associated with an increased chance of global improvement for autistic people, likely helps them to improve total autism severity and quality of life, and probably does not increase adverse events immediately after the intervention. The certainty of the evidence was rated as 'moderate' for these four outcomes, meaning that we are moderately confident in the effect estimate. No clear evidence of a difference was found for social interaction, non\u2010verbal communication, and verbal communication measured immediately post\u2010intervention. For these outcomes, the certainty of the evidence was rated as 'low' or 'very low', meaning that the true effect may be substantially different from these results. Compared with earlier versions of this review, the new studies included in this update helped to increase the certainty and applicability of this review's findings through larger sample sizes, extended age groups, longer periods of intervention and inclusion of\u00a0follow\u2010up assessments, and by predominantly using validated scales measuring generalised behaviour (i.e. behaviour outside of the therapy context).\u00a0This new evidence is important for autistic individuals and their families as well as for policymakers, service providers and clinicians, to help in decisions around the types and amount of intervention that should be provided and in the planning of resources. The\u00a0applicability of the findings is still limited to the age groups included in the studies, and no direct conclusions can be drawn about music therapy in\u00a0autistic individuals above the young adult age. More research using rigorous designs, relevant outcome measures, and longer\u2010term follow\u2010up periods is needed to corroborate these findings and to examine whether the effects of music therapy are enduring.",

            "Types of studies": "All relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi\u2010randomised trials and controlled clinical trials (CCTs), including cluster\u2010trials were considered for inclusion. Studies using single\u2010case experimental designs were included if they also met the definition of RCTs or CCTs,\u00a0that is, if the different interventions were provided in a different order to different participants (i.e. cross\u2010over RCTs/CCTs).

            "Types of participants": "Individuals of any age who were diagnosed with ASD as defined in DSM\u20105 (APA 2013) or ICD\u201011 (WHO 2021) criteria, whether identified by a psychological assessment or a psychiatric diagnosis, were considered for inclusion. Moreover, we included individuals diagnosed with pervasive developmental disorders, as defined in ICD\u201010 criteria (WHO 1994) or in previous versions of the DSM, including childhood autism, atypical autism, Asperger's syndrome, and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified, as these previous diagnostic labels are now included in the category of ASD in DSM\u20105 and ICD\u201011. Individuals with Rett's disorder or childhood disintegrative disorder were not included as they have been excluded from the ASD diagnostic category in the current classifications, given their significantly different clinical course.",
            "Types of interventions": "Interventions included music therapy (i.e. regular sessions of music therapy involving music experiences and relationships developing through them as defined above, delivered by a professional music therapist). Interventions were compared with either 'placebo' therapy (i.e. a similar intervention without the elements specific to music therapy, e.g. play therapy without music, or music listening without interaction with a music therapist; the concept of attention placebo in psychotherapy research is discussed in\u00a0Kendall 2004), no treatment, or standard care control; or music therapy added to standard care compared with standard care (with or without 'placebo' therapy).",
            "Comparators": "Interventions were compared with either 'placebo' therapy (i.e. a similar intervention without the elements specific to music therapy, e.g. play therapy without music, or music listening without interaction with a music therapist; the concept of attention placebo in psychotherapy research is discussed in\u00a0Kendall 2004), no treatment, or standard care control; or music therapy added to standard care compared with standard care (with or without 'placebo' therapy).",
            "Types of outcome measures": "To ensure that all user\u2010important outcomes were addressed (McKenzie 2021), and to update our approach in correspondence with changes that occurred in the knowledge and nosological classification of the condition in recent years (see\u00a0Differences between protocol and review), we adapted the outcome categories used in the previous version of the review, as described below. In our adaptations, we also sought to broaden outcome areas in order to not only address specific skills (e.g. social adaptation; communicative skills such as eye contact, imitating gestures or words), but also wider areas of capacity (e.g. adaptive behaviour in more than just the social domain; communication including all domains of verbal or non\u2010verbal communication, pragmatics, language structure, and communication behaviours such as withdrawal within a group). We considered the broad\u2010based measures 'global improvement' (binary) and 'total autism symptom severity' (continuous) as primary outcomes. Although not endorsed when applying a social\u2010model approach to autism, measures relating to these overall categories are still considered important in a medical\u2010model perspective on autism which is likely to be relevant for many policymakers, service providers and clinicians. As in the 2014 version of this review, we also regarded outcome measures in all areas of social communication as primary outcomes as they refer to the core characteristics defining ASD (social interaction, non\u2010verbal communication, verbal communication). In addition, we moved the category of 'quality of life' (secondary outcome 'quality of life in school, home, and other environments' in the 2014 version of this review) into primary outcomes due to the increased relevance of this outcome to autistic individuals and their families, as demonstrated in recent studies and reports (e.g.\u00a0McConachie 2015;\u00a0Provenzani 2020). To keep this review focused and manageable for users (McKenzie 2021), we merged previously separate outcomes that concern specific sub\u2010skills of social interaction ('initiating behaviour', 'social\u2010emotional reciprocity', 'joy'), with the wider category of 'social interaction'. Finally, we retained 'adverse events' as a primary outcome category. We regarded other commonly examined outcome measures in areas not specific to defining ASD characteristics as secondary outcomes. The outcome 'social adaptation skills' was re\u2010labelled as 'adaptive behaviour'. In order to address outcomes that are regarded as highly relevant by autistic people, their family members and professionals (Lipinski\u00a02019;\u00a0McConachie 2015) and that were evaluated in included studies, we newly added 'identity formation' (including self\u2010esteem) and 'depression' as secondary outcome categories. Finally, we removed the outcome category 'hyperacusis (hypersensitivity to sound)', as we did not find it measured in any study, or mentioned in any review. Data sources could have included non\u2010standardised or standardised instruments (for a review of relevant standardised instruments, see\u00a0Ozonoff 2005;\u00a0McConachie 2015;\u00a0Provenzani 2020), parent or teacher report, or school records. Data from rating scales were only included if the instrument was either a self\u2010report or completed by an independent rater or relative (i.e. not the therapist, unless reconfirmed by an independent rater). Primary outcomes included the following. Global improvement: binary (improved versus not improved or unknown, on a scale measuring clinical global impressions or on a global measure used as primary outcome in a study);    Social interaction: continuous;   Non\u2010verbal communication: continuous;   Verbal communication: continuous;   Quality of life: continuous; could be measured in various contexts (school, home, other) and with varying scope (individual, family);    Total autism symptom severity: continuous;   Adverse events: binary (any adverse event/no adverse event), as defined by study authors.

Secondary outcomes included the following. 8. Adaptive behaviour: continuous; this could be measured as positive adaptive behaviours (enabling a person to get along in their environment with greatest success and least conflict with others) or as maladaptive,\u00a0dysfunctional behaviours (which stop a person from adapting to new or difficult circumstances, including 'restricted and repetitive behaviours');9. Quality of family relationships: continuous;10. Identity formation: continuous; including self\u2010esteem and related concepts;11. Depression: continuous;12. Cognitive ability: continuous; including attention and concentration. Changes in generalised skills that are measured outside of the immediate therapy context pose the biggest challenge for any interventions for autism (Warren 2011). Generalised outcomes refer to changes that generalise to other behaviours and to other contexts across settings, people, or materials. In the\u00a0summary of findings Table 1, we report the results of seven generalised outcomes (all listed under Primary outcomes) measured immediately post\u2010intervention. We grouped outcome time points as follows: during the intervention (previously labelled \"within sessions/non\u2010generalised\"); immediately post\u2010intervention; one to five months post\u2010intervention; six to 11 months post\u2010intervention; 12 to 23 months post\u2010intervention; and 24 to 35 months post\u2010intervention. Where outcomes were measured at multiple time points during the course of therapy, we used mean values of all data from the second therapy session onwards.",

            "Appendix 2. Criteria for assigning risk of bias judgements": "Random sequence generation We judged the risk of bias for random sequence generation as follows.    Studies were judged to be at low risk of bias if participants were allocated to treatment interventions using randomisation, such as computer\u2010generated random numbers, a random numbers table, or coin\u2010tossing.    Studies were judged to be at unclear risk of bias if the randomisation method was not clearly stated or was unknown.    Studies were judged to be at high risk of bias if the method sequence generation was non\u2010random.     Randomised as well as controlled clinical trials were included in the review, as noted above (see\u00a0Types of studies).    Allocation concealment We judged the risk of bias for allocation concealment as follows.    Studies were judged to be at low risk of bias if the allocation concealment was adequate; participants and researchers were unaware of participants' future allocation to an intervention until after decisions about eligibility were made, and informed consent was obtained.    Studies were judged to be at unclear risk of bias if the methods used for allocation concealment were not described in detail.    Studies were judged to be at high risk of bias if the\u00a0allocation concealment was inadequate; allocation was not concealed, either from\u00a0participants before informed consent or from researchers before decisions about inclusion were made (this will always be the case for quasi\u2010randomised studies).     Both randomised and controlled trials were judged using the same criteria for gaining a\u00a0descriptive measure of study quality.    Blindness of participants and personnel Due to the nature of the intervention, it was not possible to blind those who delivered music therapy or those who received it. Consequently, neither participants nor therapists of the studies under review could be declared to be blinded. However, although autistic individuals were not blinded, this was unlikely to introduce bias as usually they are not fully aware of available treatment options or study design (Cheuk 2011). The possible risk of bias introduced by therapists administering the intervention was unknown. Therefore, we judged the risk of performance bias as unclear in all studies included in this\u00a0review.    Blinding of outcome assessors We determined whether those who assessed and coded the outcome measures were blind to treatment assignment using the following categories.     Studies were judged to be at low risk of bias if the assessor was blind to treatment assignment.    Studies were judged to be at unclear risk of bias if the blinding of the assessor was not reported and information was not available from the researchers.    Studies were judged to be at high risk of bias if the assessor was not blind to treatment assignment.       Completeness of outcome data We assessed whether study authors adequately dealt with missing data as follows.    Studies were judged to be at low risk of bias if the number of participants randomised to groups was clear and it was clear that all participants completed the trials in all participant groups. Studies were also judged to be at low risk of bias if outcome data were missing in both intervention groups, but reasons for these were both reported and balanced across groups.    Studies were judged to be at unclear risk of bias if information about which participants completed the study could not be acquired by contacting the study authors.    Studies were judged to be at high risk of bias if there was clear evidence of attrition or exclusion from analysis in at least one participant group that was likely to be related to the true outcome.       Selective reporting We judged the risk of selective outcome reporting as follows.    Studies were judged to be at low risk of bias if all collected data seemed to be reported and all expected outcomes were reported.    Studies were judged to be at unclear risk of bias if it was not clear whether other data were collected and not reported.    Studies were judged to be at high risk of bias if data for one or more expected outcomes were missing.       Other bias Through assessment, we determined whether any other bias was present in the trials, including inadequate music therapy methods (not corresponding to the definition of music therapy used for this review) or inadequate music therapy training of therapists delivering the intervention (without formal training based on the particular country\u2019s regulations for music therapy).",

        "criteria_text": "All relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi\u2010randomised trials and controlled clinical trials (CCTs), including cluster\u2010trials were considered for inclusion. Studies using single\u2010case experimental designs were included if they also met the definition of RCTs or CCTs,\u00a0that is, if the different interventions were provided in a different order to different participants (i.e. cross\u2010over RCTs/CCTs). Studies in which all participants received interventions in the same order (i.e. case series) were excluded. Individuals of any age who were diagnosed with ASD as defined in DSM\u20105 (APA 2013) or ICD\u201011 (WHO 2021) criteria, whether identified by a psychological assessment or a psychiatric diagnosis, were considered for inclusion. Moreover, we included individuals diagnosed with pervasive developmental disorders, as defined in ICD\u201010 criteria (WHO 1994) or in previous versions of the DSM, including childhood autism, atypical autism, Asperger's syndrome, and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified, as these previous diagnostic labels are now included in the category of ASD in DSM\u20105 and ICD\u201011. Individuals with Rett's disorder or childhood disintegrative disorder were not included as they have been excluded from the ASD diagnostic category in the current classifications, given their significantly different clinical course. Interventions included music therapy (i.e. regular sessions of music therapy involving music experiences and relationships developing through them as defined above, delivered by a professional music therapist). Interventions were compared with either 'placebo' therapy (i.e. a similar intervention without the elements specific to music therapy, e.g. play therapy without music, or music listening without interaction with a music therapist; the concept of attention placebo in psychotherapy research is discussed in\u00a0Kendall 2004), no treatment, or standard care control; or music therapy added to standard care compared with standard care (with or without 'placebo' therapy). Interventions were compared with either 'placebo' therapy (i.e. a similar intervention without the elements specific to music therapy, e.g. play therapy without music, or music listening without interaction with a music therapist; the concept of attention placebo in psychotherapy research is discussed in\u00a0Kendall 2004), no treatment, or standard care control; or music therapy added to standard care compared with standard care (with or without 'placebo' therapy). To ensure that all user\u2010important outcomes were addressed (McKenzie 2021), and to update our approach in correspondence with changes that occurred in the knowledge and nosological classification of the condition in recent years (see\u00a0Differences between protocol and review), we adapted the outcome categories used in the previous version of the review, as described below. In our adaptations, we also sought to broaden outcome areas in order to not only address specific skills (e.g. social adaptation; communicative skills such as eye contact, imitating gestures or words), but also wider areas of capacity (e.g. adaptive behaviour in more than just the social domain; communication including all domains of verbal or non\u2010verbal communication, pragmatics, language structure, and communication behaviours such as withdrawal within a group). We considered the broad\u2010based measures 'global improvement' (binary) and 'total autism symptom severity' (continuous) as primary outcomes. Although not endorsed when applying a social\u2010model approach to autism, measures relating to these overall categories are still considered important in a medical\u2010model perspective on autism which is likely to be relevant for many policymakers, service providers and clinicians. As in the 2014 version of this review, we also regarded outcome measures in all areas of social communication as primary outcomes as they refer to the core characteristics defining ASD (social interaction, non\u2010verbal communication, verbal communication). In addition, we moved the category of 'quality of life' (secondary outcome 'quality of life in school, home, and other environments' in the 2014 version of this review) into primary outcomes due to the increased relevance of this outcome to autistic individuals and their families, as demonstrated in recent studies and reports (e.g.\u00a0McConachie 2015;\u00a0Provenzani 2020). To keep this review focused and manageable for users (McKenzie 2021), we merged previously separate outcomes that concern specific sub\u2010skills of social interaction ('initiating behaviour', 'social\u2010emotional reciprocity', 'joy'), with the wider category of 'social interaction'. Finally, we retained 'adverse events' as a primary outcome category. We regarded other commonly examined outcome measures in areas not specific to defining ASD characteristics as secondary outcomes. The outcome 'social adaptation skills' was re\u2010labelled as 'adaptive behaviour'. In order to address outcomes that are regarded as highly relevant by autistic people, their family members and professionals (Lipinski\u00a02019;\u00a0McConachie 2015) and that were evaluated in included studies, we newly added 'identity formation' (including self\u2010esteem) and 'depression' as secondary outcome categories. Finally, we removed the outcome category 'hyperacusis (hypersensitivity to sound)', as we did not find it measured in any study, or mentioned in any review. Data sources could have included non\u2010standardised or standardised instruments (for a review of relevant standardised instruments, see\u00a0Ozonoff 2005;\u00a0McConachie 2015;\u00a0Provenzani 2020), parent or teacher report, or school records. Data from rating scales were only included if the instrument was either a self\u2010report or completed by an independent rater or relative (i.e. not the therapist, unless reconfirmed by an independent rater). Primary outcomes included the following. Global improvement: binary (improved versus not improved or unknown, on a scale measuring clinical global impressions or on a global measure used as primary outcome in a study);    Social interaction: continuous;   Non\u2010verbal communication: continuous;   Verbal communication: continuous;   Quality of life: continuous; could be measured in various contexts (school, home, other) and with varying scope (individual, family);    Total autism symptom severity: continuous;   Adverse events: binary (any adverse event/no adverse event), as defined by study authors.

        "title": "Reduction in saturated fat intake for cardiovascular disease",
        "abstract": "Background Reducing saturated fat reduces serum cholesterol, but effects on other intermediate outcomes may be less clear. Additionally, it is unclear whether the energy from saturated fats eliminated from the diet are more helpfully replaced by polyunsaturated fats, monounsaturated fats, carbohydrate or protein.    Objectives To assess the effect of reducing saturated fat intake and replacing it with carbohydrate (CHO), polyunsaturated (PUFA), monounsaturated fat (MUFA) and/or protein on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity, using all available randomised clinical trials.    Search methods We updated our searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid) and Embase (Ovid) on 15 October 2019, and searched Clinicaltrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) on 17 October 2019.    Selection criteria Included trials fulfilled the following criteria: 1) randomised; 2) intention to reduce saturated fat intake OR intention to alter dietary fats and achieving a reduction in saturated fat; 3) compared with higher saturated fat intake or usual diet; 4) not multifactorial; 5) in adult humans with or without cardiovascular disease (but not acutely ill, pregnant or breastfeeding); 6) intervention duration at least 24 months; 7) mortality or cardiovascular morbidity data available.    Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed inclusion, extracted study data and assessed risk of bias. We performed random\u2010effects meta\u2010analyses, meta\u2010regression, subgrouping, sensitivity analyses, funnel plots and GRADE assessment.    Main results We included 15 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (16 comparisons, 56,675 participants), that used a variety of interventions from providing all food to advice on reducing saturated fat. The included long\u2010term trials suggested that reducing dietary saturated fat reduced the risk of combined cardiovascular events by 17% (risk ratio (RR) 0.83; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70 to 0.98, 12 trials, 53,758 participants of whom 8% had a cardiovascular event, I\u00b2 = 67%, GRADE moderate\u2010quality evidence). Meta\u2010regression suggested that greater reductions in saturated fat (reflected in greater reductions in serum cholesterol) resulted in greater reductions in risk of CVD events, explaining most heterogeneity between trials. The number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) was 56 in primary prevention trials, so 56 people need to reduce their saturated fat intake for ~four years for one person to avoid experiencing a CVD event. In secondary prevention trials, the NNTB was 53. Subgrouping did not suggest significant differences between replacement of saturated fat calories with polyunsaturated fat or carbohydrate, and data on replacement with monounsaturated fat and protein was very limited.  We found little or no effect of reducing saturated fat on all\u2010cause mortality (RR 0.96; 95% CI 0.90 to 1.03; 11 trials, 55,858 participants) or cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.80 to 1.12, 10 trials, 53,421 participants), both with GRADE moderate\u2010quality evidence.  There was little or no effect of reducing saturated fats on non\u2010fatal myocardial infarction (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.07) or CHD mortality (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.16, both low\u2010quality evidence), but effects on total (fatal or non\u2010fatal) myocardial infarction, stroke and CHD events (fatal or non\u2010fatal) were all unclear as the evidence was of very low quality. There was little or no effect on cancer mortality, cancer diagnoses, diabetes diagnosis, HDL cholesterol, serum triglycerides or blood pressure, and small reductions in weight, serum total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and BMI. There was no evidence of harmful effects of reducing saturated fat intakes.    Authors' conclusions The findings of this updated review suggest that reducing saturated fat intake for at least two years causes a potentially important reduction in combined cardiovascular events. Replacing the energy from saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat or carbohydrate appear to be useful strategies, while effects of replacement with monounsaturated fat are unclear. The reduction in combined cardiovascular events resulting from reducing saturated fat did not alter by study duration, sex or baseline level of cardiovascular risk, but greater reduction in saturated fat caused greater reductions in cardiovascular events.",

            "Types of participants": "We included studies of adults (18 years or older, no upper age limit) at any risk of cardiovascular disease, with or without existing cardiovascular disease, using or not using lipid\u2010lowering medication. Participants could be of either gender, but we excluded those who were acutely ill, pregnant or lactating.",
            "Types of interventions": "We included randomised controlled trials stating an intention to reduce saturated fat (SFA) intake (by suggesting appropriate nutrient\u2010based or food\u2010based aims) OR which provided a general dietary aim, such as improving heart health or reducing total fat, that also achieved a statistically significant saturated fat reduction (P < 0.05) during the trial in the intervention arm compared with the control arm. The intervention had to be dietary advice, supplementation of fats, oils or modified or low\u2010fat foods, or a provided diet, compared to higher saturated fat intake which could be usual diet, higher saturated fat, placebo or a control diet. Intended duration of the dietary intervention was at least two years (24 months or 104 weeks). We excluded multiple risk factor interventions other than diet or supplementation (unless effects of diet or supplementation could be separated, as in a factorial design, so that the additional intervention was consistent or randomised between the intervention or control groups) and studies that aimed for weight loss in one arm but not the other. Atkins\u2010type diets aiming to increase protein and fat intake were excluded, as were studies where fat was reduced by means of a fat\u2010substitute (like Olestra). Enteral and parenteral feeds were excluded, as were formula weight reducing diets. Examples: studies that reduced saturated fats and encouraged physical activity in one arm and compared with encouraging physical activity in the control were included; studies that reducedsaturated fats and encouraged physical activity in one arm and compared with no intervention in the control were excluded; studies that reduced saturated fats and encouraged fruit and vegetables in one arm and compared with no intervention in the control were included.",

        "criteria_text": "Randomised controlled trials only. We accepted randomisation of individuals, or of larger groups (clusters) where there were at least six of these groups randomised. We excluded studies where allocation was not truly randomised (e.g. divisions based on days of the week or first letter of the family name), or where allocation was not stated as randomised, and no further information was available from the authors. We included studies of adults (18 years or older, no upper age limit) at any risk of cardiovascular disease, with or without existing cardiovascular disease, using or not using lipid\u2010lowering medication. Participants could be of either gender, but we excluded those who were acutely ill, pregnant or lactating. We included randomised controlled trials stating an intention to reduce saturated fat (SFA) intake (by suggesting appropriate nutrient\u2010based or food\u2010based aims) OR which provided a general dietary aim, such as improving heart health or reducing total fat, that also achieved a statistically significant saturated fat reduction (P < 0.05) during the trial in the intervention arm compared with the control arm. The intervention had to be dietary advice, supplementation of fats, oils or modified or low\u2010fat foods, or a provided diet, compared to higher saturated fat intake which could be usual diet, higher saturated fat, placebo or a control diet. Intended duration of the dietary intervention was at least two years (24 months or 104 weeks). We excluded multiple risk factor interventions other than diet or supplementation (unless effects of diet or supplementation could be separated, as in a factorial design, so that the additional intervention was consistent or randomised between the intervention or control groups) and studies that aimed for weight loss in one arm but not the other. Atkins\u2010type diets aiming to increase protein and fat intake were excluded, as were studies where fat was reduced by means of a fat\u2010substitute (like Olestra). Enteral and parenteral feeds were excluded, as were formula weight reducing diets. Examples: studies that reduced saturated fats and encouraged physical activity in one arm and compared with encouraging physical activity in the control were included; studies that reducedsaturated fats and encouraged physical activity in one arm and compared with no intervention in the control were excluded; studies that reduced saturated fats and encouraged fruit and vegetables in one arm and compared with no intervention in the control were included.

        "title": "Structured telephone support or non\u2010invasive telemonitoring for patients with heart failure",
        "abstract": "Background Specialised disease management programmes for heart failure aim to improve care, clinical outcomes and/or reduce healthcare utilisation. Since the last version of this review in 2010, several new trials of structured telephone support and non\u2010invasive home telemonitoring have been published which have raised questions about their effectiveness.    Objectives To review randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of structured telephone support or non\u2010invasive home telemonitoring compared to standard practice for people with heart failure, in order to quantify the effects of these interventions over and above usual care.    Search methods We updated the searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), Health Technology AsseFssment Database (HTA) on the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE (OVID), EMBASE (OVID), CINAHL (EBSCO), Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI\u2010EXPANDED), Conference Proceedings Citation Index\u2010 Science (CPCI\u2010S) on Web of Science (Thomson Reuters), AMED, Proquest Theses and Dissertations, IEEE Xplore and TROVE in January 2015. We handsearched bibliographies of relevant studies and systematic reviews and abstract conference proceedings. We applied no language limits.    Selection criteria We included only peer\u2010reviewed, published RCTs comparing structured telephone support or non\u2010invasive home telemonitoring to usual care of people with chronic heart failure. The intervention or usual care could not include protocol\u2010driven home visits or more intensive than usual (typically four to six weeks) clinic follow\u2010up.    Data collection and analysis We present data as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Primary outcomes included all\u2010cause mortality, all\u2010cause and heart failure\u2010related hospitalisations, which we analysed using a fixed\u2010effect model. Other outcomes included length of stay, health\u2010related quality of life, heart failure knowledge and self care, acceptability and cost; we described and tabulated these. We performed meta\u2010regression to assess homogeneity (the null hypothesis) in each subgroup analysis and to see if the effect of the intervention varied according to some quantitative variable (such as year of publication or median age).    Main results We include 41 studies of either structured telephone support or non\u2010invasive home telemonitoring for people with heart failure, of which 17 were new and 24 had been included in the previous Cochrane review. In the current review, 25 studies evaluated structured telephone support (eight new studies, plus one study previously included but classified as telemonitoring; total of 9332 participants), 18 evaluated telemonitoring (nine new studies; total of 3860 participants). Two of the included studies trialled both structured telephone support and telemonitoring compared to usual care, therefore 43 comparisons are evident.  Non\u2010invasive telemonitoring reduced all\u2010cause mortality (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.94; participants = 3740; studies = 17; I\u00b2 = 24%, GRADE: moderate\u2010quality evidence) and heart failure\u2010related hospitalisations (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.83; participants = 2148; studies = 8; I\u00b2 = 20%, GRADE: moderate\u2010quality evidence). Structured telephone support reduced all\u2010cause mortality (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.98; participants = 9222; studies = 22; I\u00b2 = 0%, GRADE: moderate\u2010quality evidence) and heart failure\u2010related hospitalisations (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.93; participants = 7030; studies = 16; I\u00b2 = 27%, GRADE: moderate\u2010quality evidence).  Neither structured telephone support nor telemonitoring demonstrated effectiveness in reducing the risk of all\u2010cause hospitalisations (structured telephone support: RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.00; participants = 7216; studies = 16; I\u00b2 = 47%, GRADE: very low\u2010quality evidence; non\u2010invasive telemonitoring: RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.01; participants = 3332; studies = 13; I\u00b2 = 71%, GRADE: very low\u2010quality evidence).  Seven structured telephone support studies reported length of stay, with one reporting a significant reduction in length of stay in hospital. Nine telemonitoring studies reported length of stay outcome, with one study reporting a significant reduction in the length of stay with the intervention. One telemonitoring study reported a large difference in the total number of hospitalisations for more than three days, but this was not an analysis of length of stay per hospitalisation. Nine of 11 structured telephone support studies and five of 11 telemonitoring studies reported significant improvements in health\u2010related quality of life. Nine structured telephone support studies and six telemonitoring studies reported costs of the intervention or cost effectiveness. Three structured telephone support studies and one telemonitoring study reported a decrease in costs and two telemonitoring studies reported increases in cost, due both to the cost of the intervention and to increased medical management. Adherence was rated between 55.1% and 98.5% for those structured telephone support and telemonitoring studies which reported this outcome. Participant acceptance of the intervention was reported in the range of 76% to 97% for studies which evaluated this outcome. Seven of nine studies that measured these outcomes reported significant improvements in heart failure knowledge and self\u2010care behaviours.    Authors' conclusions For people with heart failure, structured telephone support and non\u2010invasive home telemonitoring reduce the risk of all\u2010cause mortality and heart failure\u2010related hospitalisations; these interventions also demonstrated improvements in health\u2010related quality of life and heart failure knowledge and self\u2010care behaviours. Studies also demonstrated participant satisfaction with the majority of the interventions which assessed this outcome.",

We include only RCTs that have been published in full in the peer\u2010reviewed literature. We excluded any studies that did not report data for any of our outcomes of interest in an extractable format (we contacted authors of each primary study in an attempt to obtain data).",
            "Types of participants": "Adults (aged 18 years and over) of either sex, any age or ethnic group, with a definitive diagnosis of heart failure. Participants may have been recently discharged from an acute\u2010care setting (including emergency departments and acute assessment units) to home (including a relative's home but excluding nursing homes or convalescence homes) or they may have been recruited to a study while managed in the community setting. We excluded studies dealing with general cardiac disorders rather than specifically with heart failure.",
            "Types of interventions": "Structured telephone support or non\u2010invasive telemonitoring interventions needed to be scheduled, as opposed to offering telephone follow\u2010up on an 'as needed' basis. The intervention must have been initiated by a healthcare professional (medical, nursing, social work, pharmacist) and delivered to people with heart failure living in the community as the only aftercare intervention, without protocol\u2010driven home visits or intensified clinic follow\u2010up. The intervention had to be targeted at the person and intended to address their concerns and problems, not those of caregivers. The participant must not have been visited at home by a specialised heart failure healthcare professional or study personnel for the purpose of education or clinical assessment other than as an initiation visit to set up equipment. 'Usual care' consisted of standard post\u2010discharge care without intensified attendance at cardiology clinics or clinic\u2010based heart failure disease management programme, or home visiting as described above. We excluded studies if there was any previous exposure to telemonitoring or structured telephone support for the usual care or intervention arms prior to the start of the study.",

We include only RCTs that have been published in full in the peer\u2010reviewed literature. We excluded any studies that did not report data for any of our outcomes of interest in an extractable format (we contacted authors of each primary study in an attempt to obtain data). Adults (aged 18 years and over) of either sex, any age or ethnic group, with a definitive diagnosis of heart failure. Participants may have been recently discharged from an acute\u2010care setting (including emergency departments and acute assessment units) to home (including a relative's home but excluding nursing homes or convalescence homes) or they may have been recruited to a study while managed in the community setting. We excluded studies dealing with general cardiac disorders rather than specifically with heart failure. Structured telephone support or non\u2010invasive telemonitoring interventions needed to be scheduled, as opposed to offering telephone follow\u2010up on an 'as needed' basis. The intervention must have been initiated by a healthcare professional (medical, nursing, social work, pharmacist) and delivered to people with heart failure living in the community as the only aftercare intervention, without protocol\u2010driven home visits or intensified clinic follow\u2010up. The intervention had to be targeted at the person and intended to address their concerns and problems, not those of caregivers. The participant must not have been visited at home by a specialised heart failure healthcare professional or study personnel for the purpose of education or clinical assessment other than as an initiation visit to set up equipment. 'Usual care' consisted of standard post\u2010discharge care without intensified attendance at cardiology clinics or clinic\u2010based heart failure disease management programme, or home visiting as described above.

        "title": "Psychological interventions for women with non\u2010metastatic breast cancer",
        "abstract": "Background Breast cancer is the most common cancer affecting women worldwide. It is a distressing diagnosis and, as a result, considerable research has examined the psychological sequelae of being diagnosed and treated for breast cancer. Breast cancer is associated with increased rates of depression and anxiety and reduced quality of life. As a consequence, multiple studies have explored the impact of psychological interventions on the psychological distress experienced after a diagnosis of breast cancer.    Objectives To assess the effects of psychological interventions on psychological morbidities, quality of life and survival among women with non\u2010metastatic breast cancer.    Search methods We searched the following databases up to 16 May 2013: the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycINFO; and reference lists of articles. We also searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) search portal and ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing trials in addition to handsearching.    Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials that assessed the effectiveness of psychological interventions for non\u2010metastatic breast cancer in women.    Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently appraised and extracted data from eligible trials. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion. Extracted data included information about participants, methods, the intervention and outcome.    Main results Twenty\u2010eight randomised controlled trials comprising 3940 participants were included. The most frequent reasons for exclusion were non\u2010randomised trials and the inclusion of women with metastatic disease. A wide range of interventions were evaluated, with 24 trials investigating a cognitive behavioural therapy and four trials investigating psychotherapy compared to control. Pooled standardised mean differences (SMD) from baseline indicated less depression (SMD \u20101.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) \u20101.83 to \u20100.18; P = 0.02; 7 studies, 637 participants, I2 = 95%, low quality evidence), anxiety (SMD \u20100.48, 95% CI \u20100.76 to \u20100.21; P = 0.0006; 8 studies, 776 participants, I2 = 64%, low quality evidence) and mood disturbance (SMD \u20100.28, 95% CI \u20100.43 to \u20100.13; P = 0.0003; 8 studies, 1536 participants, I2 = 47%, moderate quality evidence) for the cognitive behavioural therapy group than the control group. For quality of life, only an individually\u2010delivered cognitive behavioural intervention showed significantly better quality of life than the control with an SMD of 0.65 (95% CI 0.07 to 1.23; P = 0.03; 3 studies, 141 participants, I2 = 41%, very low quality evidence). Pooled data from two group\u2010delivered studies showed a non\u2010significant overall survival benefit favouring cognitive behavioural therapy compared to control (pooled hazard ratio (HR) 0.76, 95% CI 0.25 to 2.32; P = 0.63; 530 participants, I2 = 84%, low quality evidence). Four studies compared psychotherapy to control with one to two studies reporting on each outcome. The four studies were assessed as high risk of bias and provided limited evidence of the efficacy of psychotherapy. Adverse events were not reported in any of the included studies.    Authors' conclusions A psychological intervention, namely cognitive behavioural therapy, produced favourable effects on some psychological outcomes, in particular anxiety, depression and mood disturbance. However, the evidence for survival improvement is still lacking. These findings are open to criticism because of the notable heterogeneity across the included studies and the shortcomings of the included studies.",

        "title": "Preoperative inspiratory muscle training for postoperative pulmonary complications in adults undergoing cardiac and major abdominal surgery",
        "abstract": "Background Postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) have an impact on the recovery of adults after surgery. It is therefore important to establish whether preoperative respiratory rehabilitation can decrease the risk of PPCs and to identify adults who might benefit from respiratory rehabilitation.    Objectives Our primary objective was to assess the effectiveness of preoperative inspiratory muscle training (IMT) on PPCs in adults undergoing cardiac or major abdominal surgery. We looked at all\u2010cause mortality and adverse events.    Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2014, Issue 10), MEDLINE (1966 to October 2014), EMBASE (1980 to October 2014), CINAHL (1982 to October 2014), LILACS (1982 to October 2014), and ISI Web of Science (1985 to October 2014). We did not impose any language restrictions.    Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials that compared preoperative IMT and usual preoperative care for adults undergoing cardiac or major abdominal surgery.    Data collection and analysis Two or more review authors independently identified studies, assessed trial quality, and extracted data. We extracted the following information: study characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention details, and outcome measures. We contacted study authors for additional information in order to identify any unpublished data.    Main results We included 12 trials with 695 participants; five trials included participants awaiting elective cardiac surgery and seven trials included participants awaiting elective major abdominal surgery. All trials contained at least one domain judged to be at high or unclear risk of bias. Of greatest concern was the risk of bias associated with inadequate blinding, as it was impossible to blind participants due to the nature of the study designs. We could pool postoperative atelectasis in seven trials (443 participants) and postoperative pneumonia in 11 trials (675 participants) in a meta\u2010analysis. Preoperative IMT was associated with a reduction of postoperative atelectasis and pneumonia, compared with usual care or non\u2010exercise intervention (respectively; risk ratio (RR) 0.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34 to 0.82 and RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.77). We could pool all\u2010cause mortality within postoperative period in seven trials (431 participants) in a meta\u2010analysis. However, the effect of IMT on all\u2010cause postoperative mortality is uncertain (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.04 to 4.23). Eight trials reported the incidence of adverse events caused by IMT. All of these trials reported that there were no adverse events in both groups. We could pool the mean duration of hospital stay in six trials (424 participants) in a meta\u2010analysis. Preoperative IMT was associated with reduced length of hospital stay (MD \u20101.33, 95% CI \u20102.53 to \u20100.13). According to the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group guidelines for evaluating the impact of healthcare interventions, the overall quality of studies for the incidence of pneumonia was moderate, whereas the overall quality of studies for the incidence of atelectasis, all\u2010cause postoperative death, adverse events, and duration of hospital stay was low or very low.    Authors' conclusions We found evidence that preoperative IMT was associated with a reduction of postoperative atelectasis, pneumonia, and duration of hospital stay in adults undergoing cardiac and major abdominal surgery. The potential for overestimation of treatment effect due to lack of adequate blinding, small\u2010study effects, and publication bias needs to be considered when interpreting the present findings.",

However, we planned to include cluster\u2010randomized trials if the intracluster correlation coefficient was reported.",
            "Types of participants": "We included adults (equal to or greater than 18 years of age) awaiting elective cardiac or major abdominal surgery. We defined cardiac surgery as any surgical procedure involving the heart (for example coronary artery bypass graft surgery, valve surgery, and correction of congenital defects). We defined major abdominal surgery as deliberate breach of peritoneum or retroperitoneum, including abdominal aortic surgery, gastrointestinal surgery, and urological surgery. We excluded participants undergoing chest surgery that may involve the lung per se other than cardiac surgery because such procedures are likely to have a deep influence on pulmonary complications. We also excluded participants if they had undergone surgery within two weeks of initial contact. We excluded participants if they were ASA PS 5, or had a suspected or established respiratory infection.",
            "Types of interventions": "The intervention included a tailored training programme (called 'inspiratory muscle training', or IMT) designed to increase the strength and endurance of the inspiratory muscles. IMT consists of two distinct types of specific respiratory muscle training (that is respiratory muscle strength (resistive/threshold) and endurance (hyperpnoea) training). Training occurred five to seven times a week for at least two weeks before the actual date of surgery. Each session consisted of 15 to 30 minutes of IMT, performed under supervision by either a physiotherapist, physician, or researcher. The participants were trained to use an inspiratory threshold\u2010loading device with a load of 10% to 60% of maximal inspiratory muscle strength (Pi\u2010max). The participants in the intervention group also received usual care as defined below. We excluded participants who also received IMT after the surgery. Our comparative intervention was usual care, a non\u2010exercise intervention, or no intervention. The usual\u2010care group received care as usual the day before surgery (instruction on deep\u2010breathing manoeuvres, IS, coughing, and early mobilization may be provided). We included trials that required participants to undergo rehabilitation, as long as both groups (control and intervention) received similar IS, chest physiotherapy, and mobilization after surgery.",

Definition of postoperative complications": "a) Cardiac complications  The cardiac complications were classified into the following categories (Wijeysundera 2009):     myocardial infarction: definition as per individual study;   myocardial ischaemias: as detected on an electrocardiogram or trans\u2010oesophageal echocardiogram;   supraventricular tachyarrhythmia: supraventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, or atrial flutter;    congestive heart failure: clinical diagnosis of congestive heart failure or a requirement for intra\u2010aortic balloon pump support.     b) Neurological complications  The neurological complications were classified into two categories: type I neurological complications were defined as focal injury (e.g. stroke), stupor, or coma at discharge, while type II neurological complications were defined as deterioration in intellectual function, memory deficits, or seizures (Roach 1996).  c) Surgical site infections  We will use the criteria developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for defining surgical site infections. These criteria define surgical site infections as infections related to the operative procedure that occur at or near the surgical incision within 30 days of an operative procedure or within one year if an implant is left in place (Horan 1992).",

        "criteria_text": "We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared preoperative IMT and usual preoperative care for adults undergoing cardiac or major abdominal surgery. We excluded quasi\u2010randomized studies, historically controlled trials, cohort studies, and case series. However, we planned to include cluster\u2010randomized trials if the intracluster correlation coefficient was reported. We included adults (equal to or greater than 18 years of age) awaiting elective cardiac or major abdominal surgery. We defined cardiac surgery as any surgical procedure involving the heart (for example coronary artery bypass graft surgery, valve surgery, and correction of congenital defects). We defined major abdominal surgery as deliberate breach of peritoneum or retroperitoneum, including abdominal aortic surgery, gastrointestinal surgery, and urological surgery. We excluded participants undergoing chest surgery that may involve the lung per se other than cardiac surgery because such procedures are likely to have a deep influence on pulmonary complications. We also excluded participants if they had undergone surgery within two weeks of initial contact. We excluded participants if they were ASA PS 5, or had a suspected or established respiratory infection. The intervention included a tailored training programme (called 'inspiratory muscle training', or IMT) designed to increase the strength and endurance of the inspiratory muscles. IMT consists of two distinct types of specific respiratory muscle training (that is respiratory muscle strength (resistive/threshold) and endurance (hyperpnoea) training). Training occurred five to seven times a week for at least two weeks before the actual date of surgery. Each session consisted of 15 to 30 minutes of IMT, performed under supervision by either a physiotherapist, physician, or researcher. The participants were trained to use an inspiratory threshold\u2010loading device with a load of 10% to 60% of maximal inspiratory muscle strength (Pi\u2010max). The participants in the intervention group also received usual care as defined below. We excluded participants who also received IMT after the surgery. Our comparative intervention was usual care, a non\u2010exercise intervention, or no intervention. The usual\u2010care group received care as usual the day before surgery (instruction on deep\u2010breathing manoeuvres, IS, coughing, and early mobilization may be provided). We included trials that required participants to undergo rehabilitation, as long as both groups (control and intervention) received similar IS, chest physiotherapy, and mobilization after surgery.

        "title": "Non\u2010steroidal anti\u2010inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for axial spondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis and non\u2010radiographic axial spondyloarthritis)",
        "abstract": "Background Axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) comprises ankylosing spondylitis (radiographic axSpA) and non\u2010radiographic (nr\u2010)axSpA and is associated with psoriasis, uveitis and inflammatory bowel disease. Non\u2010steroidal anti\u2010inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are recommended as first\u2010line drug treatment.    Objectives To determine the benefits and harms of NSAIDs in axSpA.   Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE to 18 June 2014.   Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi\u2010RCTs of NSAIDs versus placebo or any comparator in adults with axSpA and observational cohort studies studying the long term effect (\u2265 six months) of NSAIDs on radiographic progression or adverse events (AEs). The main comparions were traditional or COX\u20102 NSAIDs versus placebo. The major outcomes were pain, Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI), Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI), Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology Index (BASMI), radiographic progression, number of withdrawals due to AEs and number of serious AEs    Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed the risk of bias, extracted data and assessed the quality of evidence for major outcomes using GRADE.    Main results We included 39 studies (35 RCTs, two quasi\u2010RCTs and two cohort studies); and 29 RCTs and two quasi\u2010RCTs (n = 4356) in quantitative analyses for the comparisons: traditional NSAIDs versus placebo, cyclo\u2010oxygenase\u20102 (COX\u20102) versus placebo, COX\u20102 versus traditional NSAIDs, NSAIDs versus NSAIDs, naproxen versus other NSAIDs, low versus high dose. Most trials were at unclear risk of selection bias (n = 29), although blinding of participants and personnel was adequate in 24 trials. Twenty\u2010five trials had low risk of attrition bias and 29 trials had low risk of reporting bias. Risk of bias in both cohort studies was high for study participation, and low or unclear for all other criteria. No trials in the meta\u2010analyses assessed patients with nr\u2010axSpA.  Traditional NSAIDs were more beneficial than placebo at six weeks. High quality evidence (four trials, N=850) indicates better pain relief with NSAIDs (pain in control group ranged from 57 to 64 on a 100mm visual analogue scale (VAS) and was 16.5 points lower in the NSAID group (95% confidence interval (CI) \u201020.8 to \u201012.2), lower scores indicate less pain, NNT 4 (3 to 6)); moderate quality evidence (one trial, n = 190) indicates improved disease activity with NSAIDs (BASDAI in control group was 54.7 on a 100\u2010point scale and was 17.5 points lower in the NSAID group, 95% CI \u201023.1 to \u201011.8), lower scores indicate less disease activity, NNT 3 (2 to 4)); and high quality evidence (two trials, n = 356) indicates improved function with NSAIDs (BASFI in control group was 50.0 on a 100\u2010point scale and was 9.1 points lower in the NSAID group (95% CI \u201013.0 to \u20105.1), lower scores indicate better functioning, NNT 5 (3 to 8)). High (five trials, n = 1165) and moderate (three trials, n = 671) quality evidence (downgraded due to potential imprecision) indicates that withdrawals due to AEs and number of serious AEs did not differ significantly between placebo (52/1000 and 2/1000) and NSAID (39/1000 and 3/1000) groups after 12 weeks (risk ratio (RR) 0.75, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.21; and RR 1.69, 95% CI 0.36 to 7.97, respectively). BASMI and radiographic progression were not reported.  COX\u20102 NSAIDS were also more efficacious than placebo at six weeks. High quality evidence (two trials, n = 349) indicates better pain relief with COX\u20102 (pain in control group was 64 points and was 21.7 points lower in the COX\u20102 group (95% CI \u201035.9 to \u20107.4), NNT 3 (2 to 24)); moderate quality evidence (one trial, n = 193) indicates improved disease activity with COX\u20102 (BASDAI in control groups was 54.7 points and was 22 points lower in the COX\u20102 group (95% CI \u201027.4 to \u201016.6), NNT 2 (1 to 3)); and high quality evidence (two trials, n = 349) showed improved function with COX\u20102 (BASFI in control group was 50.0 points and was 13.4 points lower in the COX\u20102 group (95% CI \u201017.4 to \u20109.5), NNT 3 (2 to 4)). Low and moderate quality evidence (three trials, n = 669) (downgraded due to potential imprecision and heterogeneity) indicates that withdrawals due to AEs and number of serious AEs did not differ significantly between placebo (11/1000 and 2/1000) and COX\u20102 (24/1000 and 2/1000) groups after 12 weeks (RR 2.14, 95% CI 0.36 to 12.56; and RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.14 to 6.21, respectively). BASMI and radiographic progression were not reported.  There were no significant differences in benefits (pain on VAS: MD \u20102.62, 95% CI \u201010.99 to 5.75; three trials, n = 669) or harms (withdrawals due to AEs: RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.82; four trials, n = 995) between NSAID classes. While indomethacin use resulted in significantly more AEs (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.48; 11 studies, n = 1135), and neurological AEs (RR 2.34, 95% CI 1.32 to 4.14; nine trials, n = 963) than other NSAIDs, these findings were not robust to sensitivity analyses. We found no important differences in harms between naproxen and other NSAIDs (three trials, n = 646), although other NSAIDs appeared more effective for relieving pain (MD 6.80, 95% CI 3.72 to 9.88; two trials, n = 232). We found no clear dose\u2010response effect on benefits or harms (five studies, n = 1136). Single studies suggest NSAIDs may be effective in retarding radiographic progression, especially in certain subgroups of patients, e.g. patients with high CRP, and that this may be best achieved by continuous rather than on\u2010demand use of NSAIDs.    Authors' conclusions High to moderate quality evidence indicates that both traditional and COX\u20102 NSAIDs are efficacious for treating axSpA, and moderate to low quality evidence indicates harms may not differ from placebo in the short term. Various NSAIDs are equally effective. Continuous NSAID use may reduce radiographic spinal progression, but this requires confirmation.",

We included only trials that were published as full articles or were available as a full trial report. Extension phases and post\u2010hoc analyses of RCTs were also included to enable a comprehensive overview of the benefits and harms of NSAIDs. As radiographic progression, as well as long term harmful effects, were unlikely to be assessed in short\u2010term RCTs of NSAIDs, we also included observational cohort studies to investigate the effect of NSAIDs on these outcomes. We assessed all included studies in an assessment of adverse events/harms of therapy with NSAIDs. In addition, cohort studies assessing the effect of NSAIDs on radiographic progression had to have a minimum duration of six months in order to be included. There were no restrictions on language of the paper. We selected studies that included adults aged \u2265 18 years with a clinical diagnosis of axSpA, or patients fulfilling modified New York criteria or ASAS axial SpA criteria, including nr\u2010axSpA and AS. We included both disease subgroups. Studies containing patients with other diagnoses (e.g. trials that included participants based upon fulfilment of the European Spondyloarthropathy Study Group (ESSG) criteria or the Amor criteria (Amor 1990)) were only eligible if they presented results from patients with axSpA separately (Dougados 1991). We included studies that evaluated NSAIDs and all possible variations (dosage, intensity, mode of delivery, duration of delivery, timing of delivery, traditional and COX\u20102 selective). Comparators were: Placebo;   No therapy;   Another NSAID;   Other pharmacological therapy;   Non\u2010pharmacological therapy;   Combination therapy;   Different doses, modes of delivery, frequency and duration.

        "title": "Homocysteine\u2010lowering interventions for preventing cardiovascular events",
        "abstract": "Background Cardiovascular disease, which includes coronary artery disease, stroke and peripheral vascular disease, is a leading cause of death worldwide. Homocysteine is an amino acid with biological functions in methionine metabolism. A postulated risk factor for cardiovascular disease is an elevated circulating total homocysteine level. The impact of homocysteine\u2010lowering interventions, given to patients in the form of vitamins B6, B9 or B12 supplements, on cardiovascular events has been investigated. This is an update of a review previously published in 2009, 2013, and 2015.    Objectives To determine whether homocysteine\u2010lowering interventions, provided to patients with and without pre\u2010existing cardiovascular disease are effective in preventing cardiovascular events, as well as reducing all\u2010cause mortality, and to evaluate their safety.    Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2017, Issue 5), MEDLINE (1946 to 1 June 2017), Embase (1980 to 2017 week 22) and LILACS (1986 to 1 June 2017). We also searched Web of Science (1970 to 1 June 2017). We handsearched the reference lists of included papers. We also contacted researchers in the field. There was no language restriction in the search.    Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials assessing the effects of homocysteine\u2010lowering interventions for preventing cardiovascular events with a follow\u2010up period of one year or longer. We considered myocardial infarction and stroke as the primary outcomes. We excluded studies in patients with end\u2010stage renal disease.    Data collection and analysis We performed study selection, 'Risk of bias' assessment and data extraction in duplicate. We estimated risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes. We calculated the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB). We measured statistical heterogeneity using the I2 statistic. We used a random\u2010effects model. We conducted trial sequential analyses, Bayes factor, and fragility indices where appropriate.    Main results In this third update, we identified three new randomised controlled trials, for a total of 15 randomised controlled trials involving 71,422 participants. Nine trials (60%) had low risk of bias, length of follow\u2010up ranged from one to 7.3 years. Compared with placebo, there were no differences in effects of homocysteine\u2010lowering interventions on myocardial infarction (homocysteine\u2010lowering = 7.1% versus placebo = 6.0%; RR 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95 to 1.10, I2 = 0%, 12 trials; N = 46,699; Bayes factor 1.04, high\u2010quality evidence), death from any cause (homocysteine\u2010lowering = 11.7% versus placebo = 12.3%, RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.06, I2 = 0%, 11 trials, N = 44,817; Bayes factor = 1.05, high\u2010quality evidence), or serious adverse events (homocysteine\u2010lowering = 8.3% versus comparator = 8.5%, RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.14, I2 = 0%, eight trials, N = 35,788; high\u2010quality evidence). Compared with placebo, homocysteine\u2010lowering interventions were associated with reduced stroke outcome (homocysteine\u2010lowering = 4.3% versus comparator = 5.1%, RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.99, I2 = 8%, 10 trials, N = 44,224; high\u2010quality evidence). Compared with low doses, there were uncertain effects of high doses of homocysteine\u2010lowering interventions on stroke (high = 10.8% versus low = 11.2%, RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.22, I2 = 72%, two trials, N = 3929; very low\u2010quality evidence).  We found no evidence of publication bias.   Authors' conclusions In this third update of the Cochrane review, there were no differences in effects of homocysteine\u2010lowering interventions in the form of supplements of vitamins B6, B9 or B12 given alone or in combination comparing with placebo on myocardial infarction, death from any cause or adverse events. In terms of stroke, this review found a small difference in effect favouring to homocysteine\u2010lowering interventions in the form of supplements of vitamins B6, B9 or B12 given alone or in combination comparing with placebo.  There were uncertain effects of enalapril plus folic acid compared with enalapril on stroke; approximately 143 (95% CI 85 to 428) people would need to be treated for 5.4 years to prevent 1 stroke, this evidence emerged from one mega\u2010trial.  Trial sequential analyses showed that additional trials are unlikely to increase the certainty about the findings of this issue regarding homocysteine\u2010lowering interventions versus placebo. There is a need for additional trials comparing homocysteine\u2010lowering interventions combined with antihypertensive medication versus antihypertensive medication, and homocysteine\u2010lowering interventions at high doses versus homocysteine\u2010lowering interventions at low doses. Potential trials should be large and co\u2010operative.",

        "title": "Pre\u2010hospital versus in\u2010hospital thrombolysis for ST\u2010elevation myocardial infarction",
        "abstract": "Background Early thrombolysis for individuals experiencing a myocardial infarction is associated with better mortality and morbidity outcomes. While traditionally thrombolysis is given in hospital, pre\u2010hospital thrombolysis is proposed as an effective intervention to save time and reduce mortality and morbidity in individuals with ST\u2010elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Despite some evidence that pre\u2010hospital thrombolysis may be delivered safely, there is a paucity of controlled trial data to indicate whether the timing of delivery can be effective in reducing key clinical outcomes.    Objectives To assess the morbidity and mortality of pre\u2010hospital versus in\u2010hospital thrombolysis for STEMI.    Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (OVID), EMBASE (OVID), two citation indexes on Web of Science (Thomson Reuters) and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) for randomised controlled trials and grey literature published up to June 2014. We also searched the reference lists of articles identified, clinical trial registries and unpublished thesis sources. We did not contact pharmaceutical companies for any relevant published or unpublished articles. We applied no language, date or publication restrictions. The Cochrane Heart Group conducted the primary electronic search.    Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials of pre\u2010hospital versus in\u2010hospital thrombolysis in adults with ST\u2010elevation myocardial infarction diagnosed by a healthcare provider.    Data collection and analysis Two authors independently screened eligible studies for inclusion and carried out data extraction and 'Risk of bias' assessments, resolving any disagreement by consulting a third author. We contacted authors of potentially suitable studies if we required missing or additional information. We collected efficacy and adverse effect data from the trials.    Main results We included three trials involving 538 participants. We found low quality of evidence indicating uncertainty whether pre\u2010hopsital thrombolysis reduces all\u2010cause mortality in individuals with STEMI compared to in\u2010hospital thrombolysis (risk ratio 0.73, 95% confidence interval 0.37 to 1.41). We found high\u2010quality evidence (two trials, 438 participants) that pre\u2010hospital thrombolysis reduced the time to receipt of thrombolytic treatment compared with in\u2010hospital thrombolysis. For adverse events, we found moderate\u2010quality evidence that the occurrence of bleeding events was similar between participants receiving in\u2010hospital or pre\u2010hospital thrombolysis (two trials, 438 participants), and low\u2010quality evidence that the occurrence of ventricular fibrillation (two trials, 178 participants), stroke (one trial, 78 participants) and allergic reactions (one trial, 100 participants) was also similar between participants receiving in\u2010hospital or pre\u2010hospital thrombolysis. We considered the included studies to have an overall unclear/high risk of bias.    Authors' conclusions Pre\u2010hospital thrombolysis reduces time to treatment, based on studies conducted in higher income countries. In settings where it can be safely and correctly administered by trained staff, pre\u2010hospital thrombolysis may be an appropriate intervention. Pre\u2010hospital thrombolysis has the potential to reduce the burden of STEMI in lower\u2010 and middle\u2010income countries, especially in individuals who have limited access to in\u2010hospital thrombolysis or percutaneous coronary interventions. We found no randomised controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of pre\u2010hospital thrombolysis for STEMI in lower\u2010 and middle\u2010income countries. Large high\u2010quality multicentre randomised controlled trials implemented in resource\u2010constrained countries will provide additional evidence for the efficacy and safety of this intervention. Local policy makers should consider their local health infrastructure and population distribution needs. These considerations should be taken into account when developing clinical guidelines for pre\u2010hospital thrombolysis.",

        "title": "Statins for the prevention of dementia",
        "abstract": "Background This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2001 and then updated in 2009. Vascular risk factors including high cholesterol levels increase the risk of dementia due to Alzheimer's disease and of vascular dementia. Some observational studies have suggested an association between statin use and lowered incidence of dementia.    Objectives To evaluate the efficacy and safety of statins for the prevention of dementia in people at risk of dementia due to their age and to determine whether the efficacy and safety of statins for this purpose depends on cholesterol level, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype or cognitive level.    Search methods We searched ALOIS (the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group), The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) Portal on 11 November 2015.    Selection criteria We included double\u2010blind, randomised, placebo\u2010controlled trials in which statins were administered for at least 12 months to people at risk of dementia.    Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.   Main results We included two trials with 26,340 participants aged 40 to 82 years of whom 11,610 were aged 70 or older. All participants had a history of, or risk factors for, vascular disease. The studies used different statins (simvastatin and pravastatin). Mean follow\u2010up was 3.2 years in one study and five years in one study. The risk of bias was low. Only one study reported on the incidence of dementia (20,536 participants, 31 cases in each group; odds ratio (OR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61 to 1.65, moderate quality evidence, downgraded due to imprecision). Both studies assessed cognitive function, but at different times using different scales, so we judged the results unsuitable for a meta\u2010analysis. There were no differences between statin and placebo groups on five different cognitive tests (high quality evidence). Rates of treatment discontinuation due to non\u2010fatal adverse events were less than 5% in both studies and there was no difference between statin and placebo groups in the risk of withdrawal due to adverse events (26,340 participants, 2 studies, OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.05).    Authors' conclusions There is good evidence that statins given in late life to people at risk of vascular disease do not prevent cognitive decline or dementia. Biologically, it seems feasible that statins could prevent dementia due to their role in cholesterol reduction and initial evidence from observational studies was very promising. However, indication bias may have been a factor in these studies and the evidence from subsequent RCTs has been negative. There were limitations in the included studies involving the cognitive assessments used and the inclusion of participants at moderate to high vascular risk only.",

        "abstract": "Background The use of statin therapy in established Alzheimer's disease (AD) or vascular dementia (VaD) is a relatively unexplored area. In AD, \u03b2\u2010amyloid protein (A\u03b2) is deposited in the form of extracellular plaques and previous studies have determined A\u03b2 generation is cholesterol dependent. Hypercholesterolaemia has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of VaD. Due to the role of statins in cholesterol reduction, it is biologically plausible they may be efficacious in the treatment of AD and VaD.    Objectives To assess the clinical efficacy and safety of statins in the treatment of AD and VaD. To evaluate if the efficacy of statins in the treatment of AD and VaD depends on cholesterol level, ApoE genotype or cognitive level.    Search methods We searched ALOIS, the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group, The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS, as well as many trials registries and grey literature sources (20 January 2014).    Selection criteria Double\u2010blind, randomised controlled trials of statins given for at least six months in people with a diagnosis of dementia.    Data collection and analysis Two independent authors extracted and assessed data against the inclusion criteria. We pooled data where appropriate and entered them into a meta\u2010analysis. We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.    Main results We identified four studies (1154 participants, age range 50 to 90 years). All participants had a diagnosis of probable or possible AD according to standard criteria and most participants were established on a cholinesterase inhibitor. The primary outcome in all studies was change in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale \u2010 cognitive subscale (ADAS\u2010Cog) from baseline. When we pooled data, there was no significant benefit from statin (mean difference \u20100.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) \u20101.05 to 0.52, P value = 0.51). All studies provided change in Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) from baseline. There was no significant benefit from statins in MMSE when we pooled the data (mean difference \u20100.32, 95% CI \u20100.71 to 0.06, P value = 0.10). Three studies reported treatment\u2010related adverse effects. When we pooled data, there was no significant difference between statins and placebo (odds ratio 1.09, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.06, P value = 0.78). There was no significant difference in behaviour, global function or activities of daily living in the statin and placebo groups. We assessed risk of bias as low for all studies. We found no studies assessing role of statins in treatment of VaD.    Authors' conclusions Analyses from the studies available, including two large randomised controlled trials, indicate that statins have no benefit on the primary outcome measures of ADAS\u2010Cog or MMSE.",

        "title": "Non\u2010invasive ventilation during exercise training for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease",
        "abstract": "Background Exercise training as a component of pulmonary rehabilitation improves health\u2010related quality of life (HRQL) and exercise capacity in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, some individuals may have difficulty performing exercise at an adequate intensity. Non\u2010invasive ventilation (NIV) during exercise improves exercise capacity and dyspnoea during a single exercise session. Consequently, NIV during exercise training may allow individuals to exercise at a higher intensity, which could lead to greater improvement in exercise capacity, HRQL and physical activity.    Objectives To determine whether NIV during exercise training (as part of pulmonary rehabilitation) affects exercise capacity, HRQL and physical activity in people with COPD compared with exercise training alone or exercise training with sham NIV.    Search methods We searched the following databases between January 1987 and November 2013 inclusive:\u00a0The Cochrane Airways Group specialised register of trials, AMED, CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE, LILACS, MEDLINE, PEDro, PsycINFO and PubMed.\u00a0    Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials that compared NIV during exercise training versus exercise training alone or exercise training with sham NIV in people with COPD were considered for inclusion in this review.    Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion in the review, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Primary outcomes were exercise capacity, HRQL and physical activity; secondary outcomes were training intensity, physiological changes related to exercise training, dyspnoea, dropouts, adverse events and cost.    Main results Six studies involving 126 participants who completed the study protocols were included. Most studies recruited participants with severe to very severe COPD (mean forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) ranged from 26% to 48% predicted). There was an increase in percentage change peak and endurance exercise capacity with NIV during training (mean difference in peak exercise capacity 17%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 7% to 27%, 60 participants, low\u2010quality evidence; mean difference in endurance exercise capacity 59%, 95% CI 4% to 114%, 48 participants, low\u2010quality evidence). However, there was no clear evidence of a difference between interventions for all other measures of exercise capacity. The results for HRQL assessed using the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire do not rule out an effect of NIV (total score mean 2.5 points, 95% CI \u20102.3 to 7.2, 48 participants, moderate\u2010quality evidence). Physical activity was not assessed in any study. There was an increase in training intensity with NIV during training of 13% (95% CI 1% to 27%, 67 participants, moderate\u2010quality evidence), and isoload lactate was lower with NIV (mean difference \u20100.97 mmol/L, 95% CI \u20101.58mmol/L to \u20100.36 mmol/L, 37 participants, moderate\u2010quality evidence). The effect of NIV on dyspnoea or the number of dropouts between interventions was uncertain, although again results were imprecise. No adverse events and no information regarding cost were reported. Only one study blinded participants, whereas three studies used blinded assessors. Adequate allocation concealment was reported in four studies.    Authors' conclusions The small number of included studies with small numbers of participants, as well as the high risk of bias within some of the included studies, limited our ability to draw strong evidence\u2010based conclusions. Although NIV during lower limb exercise training may allow people with COPD to exercise at a higher training intensity and to achieve a greater physiological training effect compared with exercise training alone or exercise training with sham NIV, the effect on exercise capacity is unclear. Some evidence suggests that NIV during exercise training improves the percentage change in peak and endurance exercise capacity; however, these findings are not consistent across other measures of exercise capacity. There is no clear evidence that HRQL is better or worse with NIV during training. It is currently unknown whether the demonstrated benefits of NIV during exercise training are clinically worthwhile or cost\u2010effective.",

We considered studies with participants with stable COPD for inclusion.\u00a0Participants were considered to be stable if no history of an exacerbation was reported over the past month (Rabe 2007). The definition of COPD was based on: a clinical diagnosis of COPD; and   a best recorded ratio of forced expiratory volume during one second (FEV1) over forced vital capacity (FVC) < 70% and a best recorded FEV1 < 80% predicted for individual study participants (equivalent to GOLD stage II to IV) (GOLD 2013). a clinical diagnosis of COPD; and a best recorded ratio of forced expiratory volume during one second (FEV1) over forced vital capacity (FVC) < 70% and a best recorded FEV1 < 80% predicted for individual study participants (equivalent to GOLD stage II to IV) (GOLD 2013). We excluded studies that included participants with non\u2010COPD respiratory disease or participants with concomitant neuromuscular disease, a restrictive thoracic disorder, significant cardiac failure or cardiac disease if data from participants with COPD could not be analysed separately. The intervention for the active group consisted of the application of NIV (including bilevel, inspiratory pressure support and proportional assist ventilation) delivered via a mask or mouthpiece during all supervised exercise training sessions. The intervention for the control group was exercise training with or without sham NIV during all supervised exercise training sessions. Studies that involved the delivery of supplemental oxygen during exercise training in one group (e.g. exercise training with NIV and supplemental oxygen) were included provided that supplemental oxygen was also delivered to the alternative group (e.g. exercise training with supplemental oxygen). Similarly, studies that involved the use of nocturnal NIV were included only if both the actively treated group and the control group received nocturnal NIV. Training had to include lower limb and/or upper limb endurance exercise and had to comprise four or more weeks with a minimum of two supervised sessions per week.

        "abstract": "Background Cocaine misuse is a disorder for which no pharmacological treatment of proven efficacy exists. Advances in neurobiology could guide future medication development.    Objectives To investigate the efficacy and acceptability of dopamine agonists alone or in combination with any psychosocial intervention for the treatment of of people who misuse cocaine.    Search methods We run the search on 12 January 2015. We searched the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group (CDAG) Specialized Register, PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ICTRP, clinicaltrials.gov and screened reference lists.    Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) comparing dopamine agonists alone or associated with psychosocial intervention with placebo, no treatment or other pharmacological interventions.    Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures.   Main results Twenty four studies, including 2147 participants, met the inclusion criteria. Comparing any dopamine agonist versus placebo, we found no differences for any of the outcomes considered: dropout (moderate quality of evidence), abstinence (low quality of evidence), severity of dependence (low quality of evidence), adverse events (moderate quality of evidence). This was also observed when single dopamine agonists were compared against placebo. Comparing amantadine versus antidepressants,\u00a0we found low quality of evidence that antidepressants performed better for abstinence (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.53) based on two studies with 44 participants. No differences were found for dropout or adverse events, for both moderate quality of evidence.  The major flaws of the included studies concerned selection bias because most studies did not report information about sequence generation (80%) and allocation concealment methods (86%): half of the included studies were judged at unclear risk of performance bias and 62.5% at unclear risk of detection bias for what concerns subjective outcomes.    Authors' conclusions Current evidence from RCTs does not support the use of dopamine agonists for treating cocaine misuse. This absence of evidence may leave to clinicians the alternative of balancing the possible benefits against the potential adverse effects of the treatment. Even the potential benefit of combining a dopamine agonist with a more potent psychosocial intervention, which was suggested by the previous Cochrane Review (Soares 2003), is not supported by the results of this Cochrane Review update.",

        "title": "Blood pressure\u2010lowering efficacy of monotherapy with thiazide diuretics for primary hypertension",
        "abstract": "Background Hypertension is a modifiable cardiovascular risk factor. Although it is established that low\u2010dose thiazides reduce mortality as well as cardiovascular morbidity, the dose\u2010related effect of thiazides in decreasing blood pressure has not been subject to a rigorous systematic review. It is not known whether individual drugs within the thiazide diuretic class differ in their blood pressure\u2010lowering effects and adverse effects.    Objectives To determine the dose\u2010related decrease in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure due to thiazide diuretics compared with placebo control in the treatment of patients with primary hypertension. Secondary outcomes included the dose\u2010related adverse events leading to patient withdrawal and adverse biochemical effects on serum potassium, uric acid, creatinine, glucose and lipids.    Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2014, Issue 1), Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to February 2014), Ovid EMBASE (1974 to February 2014) and ClinicalTrials.gov.    Selection criteria We included double\u2010blind, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing fixed\u2010dose thiazide diuretic monotherapy with placebo for a duration of 3 to 12 weeks in the treatment of adult patients with primary hypertension.    Data collection and analysis Two authors independently screened articles, assessed trial eligibility, extracted data and determined risk of bias. We combined data for continuous variables using a mean difference (MD) and for dichotomous outcomes we calculated the relative risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI).    Main results We included 60 randomized, double\u2010blind trials that evaluated the dose\u2010related trough blood pressure\u2010lowering efficacy of six different thiazide diuretics in 11,282 participants treated for a mean duration of eight weeks. The mean age of the participants was 55 years and baseline blood pressure was 158/99 mmHg. Adequate blood pressure\u2010lowering efficacy data were available for hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone and indapamide. We judged 54 (90%) included trials to have unclear or high risk of bias, which impacted on our confidence in the results for some of our outcomes.  In 33 trials with a baseline blood pressure of 155/100 mmHg, hydrochlorothiazide lowered blood pressure based on dose, with doses of 6.25 mg, 12.5 mg, 25 mg and 50 mg/day lowering blood pressure compared to placebo by 4 mmHg (95% CI 2 to 6, moderate\u2010quality evidence)/2 mmHg (95% CI 1 to 4, moderate\u2010quality evidence), 6 mmHg (95% CI 5 to 7, high\u2010quality evidence)/3 mmHg (95% CI 3 to 4, high\u2010quality evidence), 8 mmHg (95% CI 7 to 9, high\u2010quality evidence)/3 mmHg (95% CI 3 to 4, high\u2010quality evidence) and 11 mmHg (95% CI 6 to 15, low\u2010quality evidence)/5 mmHg (95% CI 3 to 7, low\u2010quality evidence), respectively.  Direct comparison of doses did not show evidence of dose dependence for blood pressure\u2010lowering for any of the other thiazides for which RCT data were available: bendrofluazide, chlorthalidone, cyclopenthiazide, metolazone or indapamide.  In seven trials with a baseline blood pressure of 163/88 mmHg, chlorthalidone at doses of 12.5 mg to 75 mg/day reduced average blood pressure compared to placebo by 12.0 mmHg (95% CI 10 to 14, low\u2010quality evidence)/4 mmHg (95% CI 3 to 5, low\u2010quality evidence).  In 10 trials with a baseline blood pressure of 161/98 mmHg, indapamide at doses of 1.0 mg to 5.0 mg/day reduced blood pressure compared to placebo by 9 mmHg (95% CI 7 to 10, low\u2010quality evidence)/4 (95% CI 3 to 5, low\u2010quality evidence).  We judged the maximal blood pressure\u2010lowering effect of the different thiazides to be similar. Overall, thiazides reduced average blood pressure compared to placebo by 9 mmHg (95% CI 9 to 10, high\u2010quality evidence)/4 mmHg (95% CI 3 to 4, high\u2010quality evidence).  Thiazides as a class have a greater effect on systolic than on diastolic blood pressure, therefore thiazides lower pulse pressure by 4 mmHg to 6 mmHg, an amount that is greater than the 3 mmHg seen with angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and renin inhibitors, and the 2 mmHg seen with non\u2010selective beta\u2010blockers. This is based on an informal indirect comparison of results observed in other Cochrane reviews on ACE inhibitors, ARBs and renin inhibitors compared with placebo, which used similar inclusion/exclusion criteria to the present review.  Thiazides reduced potassium, increased uric acid and increased total cholesterol and triglycerides. These effects were dose\u2010related and were least for hydrochlorothiazide. Chlorthalidone increased serum glucose but the evidence was unclear for other thiazides. There is a high risk of bias in the metabolic data. This review does not provide a good assessment of the adverse effects of these drugs because there was a high risk of bias in the reporting of withdrawals due to adverse effects.    Authors' conclusions This systematic review shows that hydrochlorothiazide has a dose\u2010related blood pressure\u2010lowering effect. The mean blood pressure\u2010lowering effect over the dose range 6.25 mg, 12.5 mg, 25 mg and 50 mg/day is 4/2 mmHg, 6/3 mmHg, 8/3 mmHg and 11/5 mmHg, respectively. For other thiazide drugs, the lowest doses studied lowered blood pressure maximally and higher doses did not lower it more. Due to the greater effect on systolic than on diastolic blood pressure, thiazides lower pulse pressure by 4 mmHg to 6 mmHg. This exceeds the mean 3 mmHg pulse pressure reduction achieved by ACE inhibitors, ARBs and renin inhibitors, and the 2 mmHg pulse pressure reduction with non\u2010selective beta\u2010blockers as shown in other Cochrane reviews, which compared these antihypertensive drug classes with placebo and used similar inclusion/exclusion criteria.  Thiazides did not increase withdrawals due to adverse effects in these short\u2010term trials but there is a high risk of bias for that outcome. Thiazides reduced potassium, increased uric acid and increased total cholesterol and triglycerides.",

        "title": "Interventions for drug\u2010using offenders with co\u2010occurring mental health problems",
        "abstract": "Background This review represents one from a family of three reviews focusing on interventions for drug\u2010using offenders. Many people under the care of the criminal justice system have co\u2010occurring mental health problems and drug misuse problems; it is important to identify the most effective treatments for this vulnerable population.    Objectives To assess the effectiveness of interventions for drug\u2010using offenders with co\u2010occurring mental health problems in reducing criminal activity or drug use, or both.  This review addresses the following questions. \u2022 Does any treatment for drug\u2010using offenders with co\u2010occurring mental health problems reduce drug use?  \u2022 Does any treatment for drug\u2010using offenders with co\u2010occurring mental health problems reduce criminal activity?  \u2022 Does the treatment setting (court, community, prison/secure establishment) affect intervention outcome(s)?  \u2022 Does the type of treatment affect treatment outcome(s)?   Search methods We searched 12 databases up to February 2019 and checked the reference lists of included studies. We contacted experts in the field for further information.    Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials designed to prevent relapse of drug use and/or criminal activity among drug\u2010using offenders with co\u2010occurring mental health problems.    Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane .   Main results We included 13 studies with a total of 2606 participants. Interventions were delivered in prison (eight studies; 61%), in court (two studies; 15%), in the community (two studies; 15%), or at a medium secure hospital (one study; 8%). Main sources of bias were unclear risk of selection bias and high risk of detection bias.  Four studies compared a therapeutic community intervention versus (1) treatment as usual (two studies; 266 participants), providing moderate\u2010certainty evidence that participants who received the intervention were less likely to be involved in subsequent criminal activity (risk ratio (RR) 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 0.84) or returned to prison (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.67); (2) a cognitive\u2010behavioural therapy (one study; 314 participants), reporting no significant reduction in self\u2010reported drug use (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.32), re\u2010arrest for any type of crime (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.09), criminal activity (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.05), or drug\u2010related crime (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.36), yielding low\u2010certainty evidence; and (3) a waiting list control (one study; 478 participants), showing a significant reduction in return to prison for those people engaging in the therapeutic community (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.79), providing moderate\u2010certainty evidence.  One study (235 participants) compared a mental health treatment court with an assertive case management model versus treatment as usual, showing no significant reduction at 12 months' follow\u2010up on an Addictive Severity Index (ASI) self\u2010report of drug use (mean difference (MD) 0.00, 95% CI \u20100.03 to 0.03), conviction for a new crime (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.22), or re\u2010incarceration to jail (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.01), providing low\u2010certainty evidence.  Four studies compared motivational interviewing/mindfulness and cognitive skills with relaxation therapy (one study), a waiting list control (one study), or treatment as usual (two studies). In comparison to relaxation training, one study reported narrative information on marijuana use at three\u2010month follow\u2010up assessment. Researchers reported a main effect < .007 with participants in the motivational interviewing group, showing fewer problems than participants in the relaxation training group, with moderate\u2010certainty evidence. In comparison to a waiting list control, one study reported no significant reduction in self\u2010reported drug use based on the ASI (MD \u20100.04, 95% CI \u20100.37 to 0.29) and on abstinence from drug use (RR 2.89, 95% CI 0.73 to 11.43), presenting low\u2010certainty evidence at six months (31 participants). In comparison to treatment as usual, two studies (with 40 participants) found no significant reduction in frequency of marijuana use at three months post release (MD \u20101.05, 95% CI \u20102.39 to 0.29) nor time to first arrest (MD 0.87, 95% CI \u20100.12 to 1.86), along with a small reduction in frequency of re\u2010arrest (MD \u20100.66, 95% CI \u20101.31 to \u20100.01) up to 36 months, yielding low\u2010certainty evidence; the other study with 80 participants found no significant reduction in positive drug screens at 12 months (MD \u20100.7, 95% CI \u20103.5 to 2.1), providing very low\u2010certainty evidence.  Two studies reported on the use of multi\u2010systemic therapy involving juveniles and families versus treatment as usual and adolescent substance abuse therapy. In comparing treatment as usual, researchers found no significant reduction up to seven months in drug dependence on the Drug Use Disorders Identification Test (DUDIT) score (MD \u20100.22, 95% CI \u20102.51 to 2.07) nor in arrests (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.36), providing low\u2010certainty evidence (156 participants). In comparison to an adolescent substance abuse therapy, one study (112 participants) found significant reduction in re\u2010arrests up to 24 months (MD 0.24, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.28), based on low\u2010certainty evidence.  One study (38 participants) reported on the use of interpersonal psychotherapy in comparison to a psychoeducational intervention. Investigators found no significant reduction in self\u2010reported drug use at three months (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.50), providing very low\u2010certainty evidence. The final study (29 participants) compared legal defence service and wrap\u2010around social work services versus legal defence service only and found no significant reductions in the number of new offences committed at 12 months (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.07 to 6.01), yielding very low\u2010certainty evidence.    Authors' conclusions Therapeutic community interventions and mental health treatment courts may help people to reduce subsequent drug use and/or criminal activity. For other interventions such as interpersonal psychotherapy, multi\u2010systemic therapy, legal defence wrap\u2010around services, and motivational interviewing, the evidence is more uncertain. Studies showed a high degree of variation, warranting a degree of caution in interpreting the magnitude of effect and the direction of benefit for treatment outcomes.",

            "Types of studies": "Randomised controlled trials (RCTs).",
            "Types of participants": "We included people involved in the criminal justice system with co\u2010occurring mental health problems and drug misuse problems regardless of gender, age, or ethnicity. Drug misuse included any study that referred to participants who used occasionally, were dependent, or were known to abuse drugs. We defined offenders as people who were involved in the criminal justice system. Individuals could reside in special hospitals, prisons, or the community or were diverted from court or placed on arrest referral schemes for treatment. The study setting could change throughout the process of the study. For example, people involved in the criminal justice system could begin in prison but progress through a work release project into a community setting. We judged offenders to have co\u2010occurring mental health problems when the paper explicitly stated this. We used several different mechanisms to identify study samples with mental health problems, including: diagnostic gold standard tests such as criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM\u2010IV), or the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD\u201010);    the nature of the intervention (e.g. mental health court); and/or   study authors' descriptions of participants as having a \"history of psychiatric health problems\" or a \"serious mental disorder\" with co\u2010occurring substance misuse. diagnostic gold standard tests such as criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM\u2010IV), or the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD\u201010); the nature of the intervention (e.g. mental health court); and/or study authors' descriptions of participants as having a \"history of psychiatric health problems\" or a \"serious mental disorder\" with co\u2010occurring substance misuse.",
            "Types of interventions": "Included interventions were designed, wholly or in part, to eliminate or prevent relapse to drug use or criminal activity, or both, among participants. We included a range of interventions in the review. Any pharmacological intervention (e.g. buprenorphine, methadone)   Any psychosocial intervention (e.g. therapeutic community, case management, cognitive\u2010behavioural therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, motivational interviewing) Any pharmacological intervention (e.g. buprenorphine, methadone) Any psychosocial intervention (e.g. therapeutic community, case management, cognitive\u2010behavioural therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, motivational interviewing) No treatment or waiting list control   Minimal and/or alternative treatment (e.g. reporting use of a similar but less intense intervention, using a different theoretical approach with the same components and/or a different alternative intervention)    Treatment as usual (included any study that reported a combination and/or component of (1) a psychologically based intervention (e.g. anger management, motivational interviewing, counselling, aggression replacement, family therapy), (2) an educational programme (e.g. health, substance abuse education on risky behaviour), and/or (3) life skills (e.g. financial planning, employment skills, computer skills, interpersonal skills in interviews) No treatment or waiting list control Minimal and/or alternative treatment (e.g. reporting use of a similar but less intense intervention, using a different theoretical approach with the same components and/or a different alternative intervention) Treatment as usual (included any study that reported a combination and/or component of (1) a psychologically based intervention (e.g. anger management, motivational interviewing, counselling, aggression replacement, family therapy), (2) an educational programme (e.g. health, substance abuse education on risky behaviour), and/or (3) life skills (e.g. financial planning, employment skills, computer skills, interpersonal skills in interviews)",

            "Types of outcome measures": "When papers reported several different follow\u2010up periods, we reported the longest period, as we believe this measure provides the most conservative estimate of effectiveness. We provided: drug use measures reported as:   self\u2010reported drug use (unspecified drug, specific drug use not including alcohol, Addiction Severity Index composite scores); or    biological drug use (measured by drugs testing urine or analysing hair); and     criminal activity as measured by:   self\u2010reported or officially reported criminal activity (including arrest for any offence, drug offences, and/or re\u2010incarceration). drug use measures reported as: self\u2010reported drug use (unspecified drug, specific drug use not including alcohol, Addiction Severity Index composite scores); or biological drug use (measured by drugs testing urine or analysing hair); and criminal activity as measured by: self\u2010reported or officially reported criminal activity (including arrest for any offence, drug offences, and/or re\u2010incarceration).",

        "abstract": "Background Approximately 50% of patients with newly diagnosed non\u2010small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are over 70 years of age at diagnosis. Despite this fact, these patients are underrepresented in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). As a consequence, the most appropriate regimens for these patients are controversial, and the role of single\u2010agent or combination therapy is unclear. In this setting, a critical systematic review of RCTs in this group of patients is warranted.    Objectives To assess the effectiveness and safety of different cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens for previously untreated elderly patients with advanced (stage IIIB and IV) NSCLC. To also assess the impact of cytotoxic chemotherapy on quality of life.    Search methods We searched the following electronic databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2014, Issue 10), MEDLINE (1966 to 31 October 2014), EMBASE (1974 to 31 October 2014), and Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) (1982 to 31 October 2014). In addition, we handsearched the proceedings of major conferences, reference lists from relevant resources, and the ClinicalTrial.gov database.    Selection criteria We included only RCTs that compared non\u2010platinum single\u2010agent therapy versus non\u2010platinum combination therapy, or non\u2010platinum therapy versus platinum combination therapy in patients over 70 years of age with advanced NSCLC. We allowed inclusion of RCTs specifically designed for the elderly population and those designed for elderly subgroup analyses.    Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed search results, and a third review author resolved disagreements. We analyzed the following endpoints: overall survival (OS), one\u2010year survival rate (1yOS), progression\u2010free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), major adverse events, and quality of life (QoL).    Main results We included 51 trials in the review: non\u2010platinum single\u2010agent therapy versus non\u2010platinum combination therapy (seven trials) and non\u2010platinum combination therapy versus platinum combination therapy (44 trials).  Non\u2010platinum single\u2010agent versus non\u2010platinum combination therapy   Low\u2010quality evidence suggests that these treatments have similar effects on overall survival (hazard ratio (HR) 0.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 1.17; participants = 1062; five RCTs), 1yOS (risk ratio (RR) 0.88, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.07; participants = 992; four RCTs), and PFS (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.07; participants = 942; four RCTs). Non\u2010platinum combination therapy may better improve ORR compared with non\u2010platinum single\u2010agent therapy (RR 1.79, 95% CI 1.41 to 2.26; participants = 1014; five RCTs; low\u2010quality evidence).  Differences in effects on major adverse events between treatment groups were as follows: anemia: RR 1.10, 95% 0.53 to 2.31; participants = 983; four RCTs; very low\u2010quality evidence; neutropenia: RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.65; participants = 983; four RCTs; low\u2010quality evidence; and thrombocytopenia: RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.73 to 2.89; participants = 914; three RCTs; very low\u2010quality evidence. Only two RCTs assessed quality of life; however, we were unable to perform a meta\u2010analysis because of the paucity of available data.  Non\u2010platinum therapy versus platinum combination therapy   Platinum combination therapy probably improves OS (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.85; participants = 1705; 13 RCTs; moderate\u2010quality evidence), 1yOS (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.96; participants = 813; 13 RCTs; moderate\u2010quality evidence), and ORR (RR 1.57, 95% CI 1.32 to 1.85; participants = 1432; 11 RCTs; moderate\u2010quality evidence) compared with non\u2010platinum therapies. Platinum combination therapy may also improve PFS, although our confidence in this finding is limited because the quality of evidence was low (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.93; participants = 1273; nine RCTs).  Effects on major adverse events between treatment groups were as follows: anemia: RR 2.53, 95% CI 1.70 to 3.76; participants = 1437; 11 RCTs; low\u2010quality evidence; thrombocytopenia: RR 3.59, 95% CI 2.22 to 5.82; participants = 1260; nine RCTs; low\u2010quality evidence; fatigue: RR 1.56, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.38; participants = 1150; seven RCTs; emesis: RR 3.64, 95% CI 1.82 to 7.29; participants = 1193; eight RCTs; and peripheral neuropathy: RR 7.02, 95% CI 2.42 to 20.41; participants = 776; five RCTs; low\u2010quality evidence. Only five RCTs assessed QoL; however, we were unable to perform a meta\u2010analysis because of the paucity of available data.    Authors' conclusions In people over the age of 70 with advanced NSCLC who do not have significant co\u2010morbidities, increased survival with platinum combination therapy needs to be balanced against higher risk of major adverse events when compared with non\u2010platinum therapy. For people who are not suitable candidates for platinum treatment, we have found low\u2010quality evidence suggesting that non\u2010platinum combination and single\u2010agent therapy regimens have similar effects on survival. We are uncertain as to the comparability of their adverse event profiles. Additional evidence on quality of life gathered from additional studies is needed to help inform decision making.",

        "title": "Folic acid and folinic acid for reducing side effects in patients receiving methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis",
        "abstract": "Background Methotrexate (MTX) is a disease modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) used as a first line agent for treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Pharmacologically, it is classified as an antimetabolite due to its antagonistic effect on folic acid metabolism. Many patients treated with MTX experience mucosal, gastrointestinal, hepatic or haematologic side effects. Supplementation with folic or folinic acid during treatment with MTX may ameliorate these side effects.    Objectives To identify trials of supplementation with folic acid or folinic acid during MTX therapy for rheumatoid arthritis and to assess the benefits and harms of folic acid and folinic acid (a) in reducing the mucosal, gastrointestinal (GI), hepatic and haematologic side effects of MTX, and (b) whether or not folic or folinic acid supplementation has any effect on MTX benefit.    Search methods We originally performed MEDLINE searches, from January 1966 to June 1999. During the update of this review, we searched additional databases and used a sensitive search strategy designed to retrieve all trials on folic acid or folinic acid for rheumatoid arthritis from 1999 up to 2 March 2012.    Selection criteria We selected all double\u2010blind, randomised, placebo\u2010controlled clinical trials (RCTs) in which adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis were treated with MTX (at a dose equal to or less than 25 mg/week) concurrently with folate supplementation. In this update of the review we only included trials using 'low dose' folic or folinic acid (a starting dose of \u2264 7 mg weekly).    Data collection and analysis Data were extracted from the trials, and the trials were independently assessed for risk of bias using a predetermined set of criteria.    Main results Six trials with 624 patients were eligible for inclusion. Most studies had low or unclear risk of bias for key domains. The quality of the evidence was rated as 'moderate' for each outcome as assessed by GRADE, with the exception of haematologic side effects which were rated as 'low'. There was no significant heterogeneity between trials, including where folic acid and folinic acid studies were pooled.  For patients supplemented with any form of exogenous folate (either folic or folinic acid) whilst on MTX therapy for rheumatoid arthritis, a 26% relative (9% absolute) risk reduction was seen for the incidence of GI side effects such as nausea, vomiting or abdominal pain (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.92; P = 0.008). Folic and folinic acid also appear to be protective against abnormal serum transaminase elevation caused by MTX, with a 76.9% relative (16% absolute) risk reduction (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.34; P < 0.00001), as well as reducing patient withdrawal from MTX for any reason (60.8% relative (15.2% absolute) risk reduction, RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.53; P < 0.00001).  We analysed the effect of folic or folinic acid on the incidence of stomatitis / mouth sores, and whilst showing a trend towards reduction in risk, the results were not statistically significant (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.06)  It was not possible to draw meaningful conclusions on the effect of folic or folinic acid on haematologic side effects of methotrexate due to small numbers of events and poor reporting of this outcome in included trials.  It does not appear that supplementation with either folic or folinic acid has a statistically significant effect on the efficacy of MTX in treating RA (as measured by RA disease activity parameters such as tender and swollen joint counts, or physician's global assessment scores).    Authors' conclusions The results support a protective effect of supplementation with either folic or folinic acid for patients with rheumatoid arthritis during treatment with MTX.  There was a clincally important significant reduction shown in the incidence of GI side effects, hepatic dysfunction (asmeasured by elevated serum transaminase levels) as well as a clincally important significant reduction in discontinuation of MTX treatment for any reason. A trend towards a reduction in stomatitis was demonstrated however this did not reach statistical significance.  This updated review with its focus on lower doses of folic acid and folinic acid and updated assessment of risk of bias aimed to give a more precise and more clinically relevant estimate of the benefit of folate supplementation for patients with rheumatoid arthritis receiving methotrexate.",

        "title": "Interventions for preventing delirium in hospitalised non\u2010ICU patients",
        "abstract": "Background Delirium is a common mental disorder, which is distressing and has serious adverse outcomes in hospitalised patients. Prevention of delirium is desirable from the perspective of patients and carers, and healthcare providers. It is currently unclear, however, whether interventions for preventing delirium are effective.    Objectives To assess the effectiveness of interventions for preventing delirium in hospitalised non\u2010Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients.    Search methods We searched ALOIS \u2010 the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group\u2019s Specialized Register on 4 December 2015 for all randomised studies on preventing delirium. We also searched MEDLINE (Ovid SP), EMBASE (Ovid SP), PsycINFO (Ovid SP), Central (The Cochrane Library), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), LILACS (BIREME), Web of Science core collection (ISI Web of Science), ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO meta register of trials, ICTRP.    Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of single and multi\u2010 component non\u2010pharmacological and pharmacological interventions for preventing delirium in hospitalised non\u2010ICU patients.    Data collection and analysis Two review authors examined titles and abstracts of citations identified by the search for eligibility and extracted data independently, with any disagreements settled by consensus. The primary outcome was incidence of delirium; secondary outcomes included duration and severity of delirium, institutional care at discharge, quality of life and healthcare costs. We used risk ratios (RRs) as measures of treatment effect for dichotomous outcomes; and between group mean differences and standard deviations for continuous outcomes.    Main results We included 39 trials that recruited 16,082 participants, assessing 22 different interventions or comparisons. Fourteen trials were placebo\u2010controlled, 15 evaluated a delirium prevention intervention against usual care, and 10 compared two different interventions. Thirty\u2010two studies were conducted in patients undergoing surgery, the majority in orthopaedic settings. Seven studies were conducted in general medical or geriatric medicine settings.  We found multi\u2010component interventions reduced the incidence of delirium compared to usual care (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.81; seven studies; 1950 participants; moderate\u2010quality evidence). Effect sizes were similar in medical (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.92; four studies; 1365 participants) and surgical settings (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.85; three studies; 585 participants). In the subgroup of patients with pre\u2010existing dementia, the effect of multi\u2010component interventions remains uncertain (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.36; one study, 50 participants; low\u2010quality evidence).  There is no clear evidence that cholinesterase inhibitors are effective in preventing delirium compared to placebo (RR 0.68, 95% CI, 0.17 to 2.62; two studies, 113 participants; very low\u2010quality evidence).  Three trials provide no clear evidence of an effect of antipsychotic medications as a group on the incidence of delirium (RR 0.73, 95% CI, 0.33 to 1.59; 916 participants; very low\u2010quality evidence). In a pre\u2010planned subgroup analysis there was no evidence for effectiveness of a typical antipsychotic (haloperidol) (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.60; two studies; 516 participants, low\u2010quality evidence). However, delirium incidence was lower (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.52; one study; 400 participants, moderate\u2010quality evidence) for patients treated with an atypical antipsychotic (olanzapine) compared to placebo (moderate\u2010quality evidence).  There is no clear evidence that melatonin or melatonin agonists reduce delirium incidence compared to placebo (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.89; three studies, 529 participants; low\u2010quality evidence).  There is moderate\u2010quality evidence that Bispectral Index (BIS)\u2010guided anaesthesia reduces the incidence of delirium compared to BIS\u2010blinded anaesthesia or clinical judgement (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.85; two studies; 2057 participants).  It is not possible to generate robust evidence statements for a range of additional pharmacological and anaesthetic interventions due to small numbers of trials, of variable methodological quality.    Authors' conclusions There is strong evidence supporting multi\u2010component interventions to prevent delirium in hospitalised patients. There is no clear evidence that cholinesterase inhibitors, antipsychotic medication or melatonin reduce the incidence of delirium. Using the Bispectral Index to monitor and control depth of anaesthesia reduces the incidence of postoperative delirium. The role of drugs and other anaesthetic techniques to prevent delirium remains uncertain.",

        "title": "Long\u2010term effects of weight\u2010reducing drugs in people with hypertension",
        "abstract": "Background This is the third update of this review, first published in July 2009. All major guidelines on treatment of hypertension recommend weight loss; anti\u2010obesity drugs may be able to help in this respect.    Objectives Primary objectives:  To assess the long\u2010term effects of pharmacologically\u2010induced reduction in body weight in adults with essential hypertension on all\u2010cause mortality, cardiovascular morbidity, and adverse events (including total serious adverse events, withdrawal due to adverse events, and total non\u2010serious adverse events)..  Secondary objectives:  To assess the long\u2010term effects of pharmacologically\u2010induced reduction in body weight in adults with essential hypertension on change from baseline in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and on body weight reduction.    Search methods For this updated review, the Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to March 2020: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. The searches had no language restrictions. We contacted authors of relevant papers about further published and unpublished work.    Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of at least 24 weeks' duration in adults with hypertension that compared approved long\u2010term weight\u2010loss medications to placebo.\u00a0    Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risks of bias, and extracted data. Where appropriate and in the absence of significant heterogeneity between studies (P > 0.1), we pooled studies using a fixed\u2010effect meta\u2010analysis. When heterogeneity was present, we used the random\u2010effects method and investigated the cause of the heterogeneity.    Main results This third update of the review added one new trial, investigating the combination of naltrexone/bupropion versus placebo. Two medications, which were included in the previous versions of this review (rimonabant and sibutramine) are no longer considered relevant for this update, since their marketing approval was withdrawn in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The number of included studies in this review update is therefore six (12,724 participants in total): four RCTs comparing orlistat to placebo, involving a total of 3132 participants with high blood pressure and a mean age of 46 to 55 years; one trial comparing phentermine/topiramate to placebo, involving 1305 participants with high blood pressure and a mean age of 53 years; and one trial comparing naltrexone/bupropion to placebo, involving 8283 participants with hypertension and a mean age of 62 years. We judged the risks of bias to be unclear for the trials investigating orlistat or naltrexone/bupropion. and low for the trial investigating phentermine/topiramate. Only the study of naltrexone/bupropion included cardiovascular mortality and morbidity as predefined outcomes.  There were no differences in the rates of all\u2010cause or cardiovascular mortality, major cardiovascular events, or serious adverse events between naltrexone/bupropion and placebo. The incidence of overall adverse events was significantly higher in participants treated with naltrexone/bupropion. For orlistat, the incidence of gastrointestinal side effects was consistently higher compared to placebo. The most frequent side effects with phentermine/topiramate were dry mouth and paraesthesia. After six to 12 months, orlistat reduced systolic blood pressure compared to placebo by mean difference (MD) \u22122.6 mm Hg (95% confidence interval (CI) \u22123.8 to \u22121.4 mm Hg; 4 trials, 2058 participants) and diastolic blood pressure by MD \u22122.0 mm Hg (95% CI \u22122.7 to \u22121.2 mm Hg; 4 trials, 2058 participants). After 13 months of follow\u2010up, phentermine/topiramate decreased systolic blood pressure compared to placebo by \u22122.0 to \u22124.2 mm Hg (1 trial, 1030 participants) (depending on drug dosage), and diastolic blood pressure by \u22121.3 to \u22121.9 mm Hg (1 trial, 1030 participants) (depending on drug dosage). There was no difference in the change in systolic or diastolic blood pressure between naltrexone/bupropion and placebo (1 trial, 8283 participants). We identified no relevant studies investigating liraglutide or lorcaserin in people with hypertension.    Authors' conclusions In people with elevated blood pressure, orlistat, phentermine/topiramate and naltrexone/bupropion reduced body weight; the magnitude of the effect was greatest with phentermine/topiramate. In the same trials, orlistat and phentermine/topiramate, but not naltrexone/bupropion, reduced blood pressure. One RCT of naltrexone/bupropion versus placebo showed no differences in all\u2010cause mortality or cardiovascular mortality or morbidity after two years. The European Medicines Agency refused marketing authorisation for phentermine/topiramate due to safety concerns, while for lorcaserin the application for European marketing authorisation was withdrawn due to a negative overall benefit/risk balance. In 2020 lorcaserin was also withdrawn from the US market. Two other medications (rimonabant and sibutramine) had already been withdrawn from the market in 2009 and 2010, respectively.",

        "title": "Non\u2010invasive positive pressure ventilation for prevention of complications after pulmonary resection in lung cancer patients",
        "abstract": "Background Pulmonary complications are often seen during the postoperative period following lung resection for patients with lung cancer. Some situations such as intubation, a long stay in the intensive care unit, the high cost of antibiotics and mortality may be avoided with the prevention of postoperative pulmonary complications. Non\u2010invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) is widely used in hospitals, and is thought to reduce the number of pulmonary complications and mortality after this type of surgery. Therefore, a systematic review is needed to critically assess the benefits and harms of NIPPV for patients undergoing lung resection. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2015.    Objectives To assess the effectiveness and safety of NIPPV for preventing complications in patients following pulmonary resection for lung cancer.    Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS and PEDro until 21 December 2018, to identify potentially eligible trials. We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches. We searched the reference lists of relevant papers and contacted experts in the field for information about additional published and unpublished studies. We also searched the Register of Controlled Trials (www.controlled\u2010trials.com) and ClinicalTrials.gov (clinicaltrials.gov) to identify ongoing studies.    Selection criteria We considered randomised or quasi\u2010randomised clinical trials that compared NIPPV in the immediate postoperative period after pulmonary resection with no intervention or conventional respiratory therapy.    Data collection and analysis Two authors collected data and assessed trial risk of bias. Where possible, we pooled data from the individual studies using a fixed\u2010effect model (quantitative synthesis), but where this was not possible we tabulated or presented the data in the main text (qualitative synthesis). Where substantial heterogeneity existed, we applied a random\u2010effects model.    Main results Of the 190 references retrieved from the searches, 7 randomised clinical trials (RCTs) (1 identified with the new search) and 1 quasi\u2010randomised trial fulfilled the eligibility criteria for this review, including a total of 486 patients. Five studies described quantitative measures of pulmonary complications, with pooled data showing no difference between NIPPV compared with no intervention (RR 1.03; 95% CI 0.72 to 1.47). Three studies reported intubation rates and there was no significant difference between the intervention and control groups (RR 0.55; 95% CI 0.25 to 1.20). Five studies reported measures of mortality on completion of the intervention period. There was no statistical difference between the groups for this outcome (RR 0.60; 95% CI 0.24 to 1.53). Similar results were observed in the subgroup analysis considering ventilatory mode (bi\u2010level versus continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). No study evaluated the postoperative use of antibiotics. Two studies reported the length of intensive care unit stay and there was no significant difference between the intervention and control groups (MD \u20100.75; 95% CI \u20103.93 to 2.43). Four studies reported the length of hospital stay and there was no significant difference between the intervention and control groups (MD \u20100.12; 95% CI \u20106.15 to 5.90). None of the studies described any complications related to NIPPV. Of the seven included studies, four studies were considered as 'low risk of bias' in all domains, two studies were considered 'high risk of bias' for the allocation concealment domain, and one of these was also considered 'high risk of bias' for random sequence generation. One other study was considered \u2018high risk of bias\u2019 for including participants with more severe disease. The new study identified could not be included in the meta\u2010analysis as its intervention differed from the other studies (use of pre and postoperative NIPPV in the same population).    Authors' conclusions This review demonstrated that there was no additional benefit of using NIPPV in the postoperative period after pulmonary resection for all outcomes analysed (pulmonary complications, rate of intubation, mortality, postoperative consumption of antibiotics, length of intensive care unit stay, length of hospital stay and adverse effects related to NIPPV). However, the quality of evidence is 'very low', 'low' and 'moderate' since there were few studies, with small sample size and low frequency of outcomes. New well\u2010designed and well\u2010conducted randomised trials are needed to answer the questions of this review with greater certainty.",

        "title": "Statins for acute coronary syndrome",
        "abstract": "Background The early period following the onset of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) represents a critical stage of coronary heart disease, with a high risk of recurrent events and deaths. The short\u2010term effects of early treatment with statins on patient\u2010relevant outcomes in patients suffering from ACS are unclear. This is an update of a review previously published in 2011.    Objectives To assess the effects, both harms and benefits, of early administered statins in patients with ACS, in terms of mortality and cardiovascular events.    Search methods We updated the searches of CENTRAL (2013, Issue 3), MEDLINE (Ovid) (1946 to April Week 1 2013), EMBASE (Ovid) (1947 to 2013 Week 14), and CINAHL (EBSCO) (1938 to 2013) on 12 April 2013. We applied no language restrictions. We supplemented the search by contacting experts in the field, by reviewing the reference lists of reviews and editorials on the topic, and by searching trial registries.    Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing statins with placebo or usual care, with initiation of statin therapy within 14 days following the onset of ACS, follow\u2010up of at least 30 days, and reporting at least one clinical outcome.    Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) for all outcomes in the treatment and control groups and pooled data using random\u2010effects models.    Main results Eighteen studies (14,303 patients) compared early statin treatment versus placebo or no treatment in patients with ACS. The new search did not identify any new studies for inclusion. There were some concerns about risk of bias and imprecision of summary estimates. Based on moderate quality evidence, early statin therapy did not decrease the combined primary outcome of death, non\u2010fatal myocardial infarction, and stroke at one month (risk ratio (RR) 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 1.08) or four months (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.06) of follow\u2010up when compared to placebo or no treatment. There were no statistically significant risk reductions from statins for total death, total myocardial infarction, total stroke, cardiovascular death, revascularization procedures, and acute heart failure at one month or at four months, although there were favorable trends related to statin use for each of these endpoints. Moderate quality evidence suggests that the incidence of unstable angina was significantly reduced at four months following ACS (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.96). There were nine individuals with myopathy (elevated creatinine kinase levels more than 10 times the upper limit of normal) in statin\u2010treated patients (0.13%) versus one (0.015%) in the control groups. Serious muscle toxicity was mostly limited to patients treated with simvastatin 80 mg.    Authors' conclusions Based on moderate quality evidence, due to concerns about risk of bias and imprecision, initiation of statin therapy within 14 days following ACS does not reduce death, myocardial infarction, or stroke up to four months, but reduces the occurrence of unstable angina at four months following ACS. Serious side effects were rare.",

            "Types of participants": "Adults with recent ACS, regardless of prior lipid levels and prior lipid\u2010modifying treatment or diet. ACS is defined as a broad spectrum of manifestations that are due to insufficient coronary blood supply. These include ST\u2010segment elevation myocardial infarction, non\u2010ST\u2010segment elevation ACS with or without myocardial cell necrosis (unstable angina and/or non\u2010ST\u2010segment elevation myocardial infarction), and ST\u2010segment depression (non\u2010Q\u2010wave) myocardial infarction. We included patients regardless of previous ACS, percutaneous coronary interventions including stents, or co\u2010morbidities such as atrial fibrillation with or without antithrombotic treatment.",
            "Types of interventions": "Initiation of statin therapy (HMG\u2010CoA reductase inhibitors such as pravastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, rosuvastatin) administered orally at any dosage within 14 days following the onset of an acute coronary syndrome. We only considered trials using cerivastatin for sensitivity analysis since this compound was withdrawn from the market in 2001 (Staffa 2002).",
            "Types of outcome measures": "We assessed the following clinical outcomes at one month, four months (range three to six months), and 12 months of follow\u2010up. Combined outcome of non\u2010fatal myocardial infarction, non\u2010fatal stroke, and death from all causes Combined outcome of non\u2010fatal myocardial infarction, non\u2010fatal stroke, and death from all causes Death from all causes   Death from cardiovascular causes   Fatal and non\u2010fatal myocardial infarction or reinfarction   Fatal and non\u2010fatal stroke   Revascularization procedures (bypass grafts, angioplasty with or without stenting)   Unstable angina (recurrent myocardial ischemia requiring emergency hospitalization)   Acute (new or worsening) heart failure   Adverse events (rhabdomyolysis, creatinine kinase levels more than 10 times the upper limit of normal values, and liver aminotransferase levels more than three times the upper limit of normal values)    Patient\u2010perceived quality of life Death from all causes Death from cardiovascular causes Fatal and non\u2010fatal myocardial infarction or reinfarction Fatal and non\u2010fatal stroke Revascularization procedures (bypass grafts, angioplasty with or without stenting) Unstable angina (recurrent myocardial ischemia requiring emergency hospitalization) Acute (new or worsening) heart failure Adverse events (rhabdomyolysis, creatinine kinase levels more than 10 times the upper limit of normal values, and liver aminotransferase levels more than three times the upper limit of normal values) Patient\u2010perceived quality of life We considered outcomes and adverse events irrespective of their putative relation to the treatment. To maximize the statistical power of our primary analysis and to recognize the event hierarchy of fatal and non\u2010fatal events (occurrence of death precludes any other clinical events), we chose a combined primary endpoint to test the most patient\u2010relevant 'hard' outcomes: death, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Each of the components is highly patient\u2010relevant and about equally frequent (Montori 2005).",
            "Primary outcome": "Combined outcome of non\u2010fatal myocardial infarction, non\u2010fatal stroke, and death from all causes",
            "Secondary outcomes": "Death from all causes   Death from cardiovascular causes   Fatal and non\u2010fatal myocardial infarction or reinfarction   Fatal and non\u2010fatal stroke   Revascularization procedures (bypass grafts, angioplasty with or without stenting)   Unstable angina (recurrent myocardial ischemia requiring emergency hospitalization)   Acute (new or worsening) heart failure   Adverse events (rhabdomyolysis, creatinine kinase levels more than 10 times the upper limit of normal values, and liver aminotransferase levels more than three times the upper limit of normal values)    Patient\u2010perceived quality of life    We considered outcomes and adverse events irrespective of their putative relation to the treatment.

        "title": "Blood pressure lowering efficacy of nonselective beta\u2010blockers for primary hypertension",
        "abstract": "Background Beta\u2010blockers are one of the classes of drugs frequently used to treat hypertension. Quantifying the blood pressure (BP) lowering effects of nonselective beta\u2010blockers provides important information that aids clinical decision making.    Objectives To quantify the dose\u2010related effects of nonselective beta\u2010adrenergic receptor blockers (beta\u2010blockers) on systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) as compared with placebo in people with primary hypertension.    Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and ClinicalTrials.gov for randomized controlled trials up to October 2013.    Selection criteria Randomized, double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled, parallel or cross\u2010over trials. Studies had to contain a nonselective beta\u2010blocker monotherapy arm with a fixed dose. Participants enrolled into the studies had to have primary hypertension at baseline. Duration of studies had to be between three and 12 weeks.    Data collection and analysis Two review authors (GW and AL) independently confirmed the inclusion of studies and extracted the data.    Main results We included 25 RCTs that evaluated the BP lowering effects of seven nonselective beta\u2010blockers in 1264 people with hypertension. Among the 25 RCTs, four were parallel studies and 21 were cross\u2010over studies. Overall, nonselective beta\u2010blockers lowered systolic BP and diastolic BP compared with placebo. Nonselective beta\u2010blockers, in the recommended dose range, did not showed a convincing dose\u2010response relationship by direct comparison. The once (1x) and twice (2x) starting dose subgroups contained the largest sample size. The estimate of BP lowering efficacy for nonselective beta\u2010blockers by combining the 1x and 2x starting dose subgroup was \u201010 mmHg (95% CI \u201011 to \u20108) for systolic BP and \u20107 mmHg (95% CI \u20108 to \u20106) for diastolic BP (low\u2010quality evidence). Nonselective beta\u2010blockers starting at the 1x recommended starting doses lowered heart rate by 12 beats per minute (95% CI 10 to 13) (low\u2010quality evidence). The dose\u2010response relationship in heart rate was evident by both direct and indirect comparison. Due to imprecision, there was no clear evidence of an effect of nonselective beta\u2010blockers on pulse pressure in any dose subgroups except for a small reduction with the 2x starting dose (\u20102.2 mmHg, 95% CI \u20103.7 to \u20100.7) (very low quality evidence). The point estimates in the 1x, four times (4x) and eight times (8x) starting dose subgroups were similar to the 2x starting dose subgroup. Therefore, it would appear that if nonselective beta\u2010blockers do lower pulse pressure, the magnitude is likely to be about 2 mmHg. There were very limited data (two studies) on withdrawals due to adverse effects (risk ratio (RR) 0.84; 95% CI 0.38 to 1.82).    Authors' conclusions In people with mild\u2010to\u2010moderate hypertension, nonselective beta\u2010blockers lowered peak BP by a mean of \u201010/\u20107 mmHg (systolic/diastolic) and reduced heart rate by 12 beats per minute. Propranolol and penbutolol were the two drugs that contributed to most of the data for nonselective beta\u2010blockers. This estimate is likely exaggerated due to the presence of extreme outliers and other sources of bias. If we removed the extreme outliers from the analysis, the estimate for non\u2010selective beta\u2010blockers was lower (\u20108/\u20105 mmHg (systolic/diastolic)). Nonselective beta\u2010blockers did not show a convincing graded dose\u2010response in the recommended dose range for systolic BP and diastolic BP, while higher dose nonselective beta\u2010blockers provided greater reduction of heart rate. Using higher dose nonselective beta\u2010blockers might cause more side effects, such as bradycardia, without producing an additional BP lowering effect. The effect of nonselective beta\u2010blockers on pulse pressure was likely small, at about 2 mmHg.",

        "title": "Cerebrolysin for acute ischaemic stroke",
        "abstract": "Background Cerebrolysin is a mixture of low\u2010molecular\u2010weight peptides and amino acids derived from porcine brain that has potential neuroprotective properties. It is widely used in the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke in Russia, Eastern Europe, China, and other Asian and post\u2010Soviet countries. This is an update of a review first published in 2010 and last updated in 2017.    Objectives To assess the benefits and harms of Cerebrolysin for treating acute ischaemic stroke.   Search methods We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science Core Collection, with Science Citation Index, LILACS, OpenGrey, and a number of Russian databases in October 2019. We also searched reference lists, ongoing trials registers, and conference proceedings.    Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing Cerebrolysin, started within 48 hours of stroke onset and continued for any length of time, with placebo or no treatment in people with acute ischaemic stroke.    Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently applied the inclusion criteria, assessed trial quality and risk of bias, extracted data, and applied GRADE criteria to the evidence.    Main results Seven RCTs (1601 participants) met the inclusion criteria of the review. In this update we re\u2010evaluated risk of bias through identification, examination, and evaluation of study protocols and judged it to be low, unclear, or high across studies: unclear for all domains in one study, and unclear for selective outcome reporting across all studies; low for blinding of participants and personnel in four studies and unclear in the remaining three; low for blinding of outcome assessors in three studies and unclear in four studies. We judged risk of bias to be low in two studies and unclear in the remaining five studies for generation of allocation sequence; low in one study and unclear in six studies for allocation concealment; and low in one study, unclear in one study, and high in the remaining five studies for incomplete outcome data. The manufacturer of Cerebrolysin supported four multicentre studies, either totally, or by providing Cerebrolysin and placebo, randomisation codes, research grants, or statisticians. We judged three studies to be at high risk of other bias and the remaining four studies to be at unclear risk of other bias.  All\u2010cause death: we extracted data from six trials (1517 participants). Cerebrolysin probably results in little to no difference in all\u2010cause death: risk ratio (RR) 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61 to 1.32 (6\u00a0trials, 1517 participants, moderate\u2010quality evidence).  None of the included trials reported on poor functional outcome defined as death or dependence at the end of the follow\u2010up period or early death (within two weeks of stroke onset), or time to restoration of capacity for work and quality of life.  Only one trial clearly reported on the cause of death: cerebral infarct (four in the Cerebrolysin and two in the placebo group), heart failure (two in the Cerebrolysin and one in the placebo group), pulmonary embolism (two in the placebo group), and pneumonia (one in the placebo group).  Serious adverse events (SAEs): Cerebrolysin probably results in little to no difference in the total number of people with SAEs (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.65, 4 RCTs, 1435 participants, moderate\u2010quality evidence). This comprised fatal SAEs (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.38) and an increase in the total number of people with non\u2010fatal SAEs (RR 2.15, 95% CI 1.01 to 4.55, P = 0.047, 4 trials, 1435 participants, moderate\u2010quality evidence). In the subgroup of dosing schedule 30 mL for 10 days (cumulative dose 300 mL), the increase was more prominent: RR 2.86, 95% CI 1.23 to 6.66, P = 0.01 (2 trials, 1189 participants).  Total number of people with adverse events: four trials reported on this outcome. Cerebrolysin may result in little to no difference in the total number of people with adverse events: RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.10, P = 0.90, 4 trials, 1435 participants, low\u2010quality evidence.  Non\u2010death attrition: evidence from six trials involving 1517 participants suggests that Cerebrolysin results in little to no difference in non\u2010death attrition, with 96 out of 764 Cerebrolysin\u2010treated participants and 117 out of 753 placebo\u2010treated participants being lost to follow\u2010up for reasons other than death (very low\u2010quality evidence).    Authors' conclusions Moderate\u2010quality evidence indicates that Cerebrolysin probably has little or no beneficial effect on preventing all\u2010cause death in acute ischaemic stroke, or on the total number of people with serious adverse events. Moderate\u2010quality evidence also indicates a potential increase in non\u2010fatal serious adverse events with Cerebrolysin use.",

            "Types of studies": "We included all published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing Cerebrolysin with placebo or no treatment in people with acute ischaemic stroke.

            "Types of participants": "People with acute ischaemic stroke, irrespective of age, sex, or social status, whose symptom onset was less than 48 hours previously. Stroke symptoms include: sudden weakness or numbness of the face, arm, or leg, often unilateral; confusion; difficulties in speaking or seeing with one or both eyes; difficulties walking; loss of balance or co\u2010ordination; severe no\u2010cause headache; fainting or loss of consciousness. Stroke diagnosis confirmation with neuroimaging was not an inclusion criterion. For future updates stroke diagnosis confirmation by neuroimaging will be mandatory.",

Standard treatment is not defined precisely and differs between studies. Study medication must have been started within 48 hours of onset of stroke and continued for any period of time.

After identifying and evaluating available trial registration protocols, we decided to add this new outcome to the update as a measure not only of attrition per se, but also as a grey zone in the presentation of trial populations allowing us to characterise attrition and reporting bias better.    Poor functional outcome defined as death or dependence at the end of the follow\u2010up period: various scales, such as the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), the modified Rankin Scale (mRS), and the Barthel Scale/Index (BI) can be used to evaluate impairment brought about by stroke. The mRS is commonly used and is a scale from 0 to 6, with 0 being no symptoms; 1, no significant disability; 2, slight disability; 3, moderate disability; 4, moderate to severe disability; 5, severe disability; 6, death.    Early death (within two weeks of stroke onset).   Quality of life, if assessed in the included studies.   Time to restoration of capacity for work, either as a time\u2010to\u2010event outcome (e.g. analysed as a hazard ratio) or as a continuous outcome, depending on study data.
