        "title": "Consumers\u2019 and health providers\u2019 views and perceptions of partnering to improve health services design, delivery and evaluation: a co\u2010produced qualitative evidence synthesis",
        "abstract": "Background Partnering with consumers in the planning, delivery and evaluation of health services is an essential component of person\u2010centred care. There are many ways to partner with consumers to improve health services, including formal group partnerships (such as committees, boards or steering groups). However, consumers' and health providers' views and experiences of formal group partnerships remain unclear.  In this qualitative evidence synthesis (QES), we focus specifically on formal group partnerships where health providers and consumers share decision\u2010making about planning, delivering and/or evaluating health services. Formal group partnerships were selected because they are widely used throughout the world to improve person\u2010centred care.  For the purposes of this QES, the term 'consumer' refers to a person who is a patient, carer or community member who brings their perspective to health service partnerships. 'Health provider' refers to a person with a health policy, management, administrative or clinical role who participates in formal partnerships in an advisory or representative capacity.  This QES was co\u2010produced with a Stakeholder Panel of consumers and health providers. The QES was undertaken concurrently with a Cochrane intervention review entitled Effects of consumers and health providers working in partnership on health services planning, delivery and evaluation.    Objectives 1. To synthesise the views and experiences of consumers and health providers of formal partnership approaches that aimed to improve planning, delivery or evaluation of health services.  2. To identify best practice principles for formal partnership approaches in health services by understanding consumers' and health providers' views and experiences.    Search methods We searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and CINAHL for studies published between January 2000 and October 2018. We also searched grey literature sources including websites of relevant research and policy organisations involved in promoting person\u2010centred care.    Selection criteria We included qualitative studies that explored consumers' and health providers' perceptions and experiences of partnering in formal group formats to improve the planning, delivery or evaluation of health services.    Data collection and analysis Following completion of abstract and full\u2010text screening, we used purposive sampling to select a sample of eligible studies that covered a range of pre\u2010defined criteria, including rich data, range of countries and country income level, settings, participants, and types of partnership activities. A Framework Synthesis approach was used to synthesise the findings of the sample. We appraised the quality of each study using the CASP (Critical Appraisal Skill Program) tool. We assessed our confidence in the findings using the GRADE\u2010CERQual (Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research) approach.  The Stakeholder Panel was involved in each stage of the review from development of the protocol to development of the best practice principles.    Main results We found 182 studies that were eligible for inclusion. From this group, we selected 33 studies to include in the final synthesis. These studies came from a wide range of countries including 28 from high\u2010income countries and five from low\u2010 or middle\u2010income countries (LMICs).  Each of the studies included the experiences and views of consumers and/or health providers of partnering in formal group formats. The results were divided into the following categories.  Contextual factors influencing partnerships: government policy, policy implementation processes and funding, as well as the organisational context of the health service, could facilitate or impede partnering (moderate level of confidence).  Consumer recruitment: consumer recruitment occurred in different ways and consumers managed the recruitment process in a minority of studies only (high level of confidence). Recruiting a range of consumers who were reflective of the clinic's demographic population was considered desirable, particularly by health providers (high level of confidence). Some health providers perceived that individual consumers' experiences were not generalisable to the broader population whereas consumers perceived it could be problematic to aim to represent a broad range of community views (high level of confidence).  Partnership dynamics and processes: positive interpersonal dynamics between health providers and consumers facilitated partnerships (high level of confidence). However, formal meeting formats and lack of clarity about the consumer role could constrain consumers\u2019 involvement (high level of confidence). Health providers\u2019 professional status, technical knowledge and use of jargon were intimidating for some consumers (high level of confidence) and consumers could feel their experiential knowledge was not valued (moderate level of confidence). Consumers could also become frustrated when health providers dominated the meeting agenda (moderate level of confidence) and when they experienced token involvement, such as a lack of decision\u2010making power (high level of confidence)  Perceived impacts on partnership participants: partnering could affect health provider and consumer participants in both positive and negative ways (high level of confidence).  Perceived impacts on health service planning, delivery and evaluation: partnering was perceived to improve the person\u2010centredness of health service culture (high level of confidence), improve the built environment of the health service (high level of confidence), improve health service design and delivery e.g. facilitate 'out of hours' services or treatment closer to home (high level of confidence), enhance community ownership of health services, particularly in LMICs (moderate level of confidence), and improve consumer involvement in strategic decision\u2010making, under certain conditions (moderate level of confidence). There was limited evidence suggesting partnering may improve health service evaluation (very low level of confidence).  Best practice principles for formal partnering to promote person\u2010centred care were developed from these findings. The principles were developed collaboratively with the Stakeholder Panel and included leadership and health service culture; diversity; equity; mutual respect; shared vision and regular communication; shared agendas and decision\u2010making; influence and sustainability.    Authors' conclusions Successful formal group partnerships with consumers require health providers to continually reflect and address power imbalances that may constrain consumers' participation. Such imbalances may be particularly acute in recruitment procedures, meeting structure and content and decision\u2010making processes. Formal group partnerships were perceived to improve the physical environment of health services, the person\u2010centredness of health service culture and health service design and delivery. Implementing the best practice principles may help to address power imbalances, strengthen formal partnering, improve the experiences of consumers and health providers and positively affect partnership outcomes.",

            "Types of phenomena of interest": "We included qualitative studies that focused on working in formal group partnerships to improve planning, delivery or evaluation of health services. Partnering is defined as \"healthcare organisations, healthcare providers and policymakers actively working with people who use the healthcare system to ensure that health information and services meet people's needs\" (ACSQHC 2018). For the purposes of this review, formal group partnerships were operationalised as consumers and health providers meeting jointly and regularly in formal group formats (e.g. committees, councils, working groups) to share decision\u2010making for the purpose of planning, delivery or evaluation in one or more health service(s). Studies meeting the following criteria were eligible for inclusion. Consumers and health providers were engaged in formal group formats, such as committees, councils, boards or steering groups.    The group involved at least one consumer and at least one health provider.   The group met jointly, more than once via face\u2010to\u2010face or electronic modes.   The group was either ongoing or time\u2010limited (for example, groups formed for a specific project).    The group made joint decisions for planning and/or delivery and/or evaluation of health services. Consumers and health providers were engaged in formal group formats, such as committees, councils, boards or steering groups. The group involved at least one consumer and at least one health provider. The group met jointly, more than once via face\u2010to\u2010face or electronic modes. The group was either ongoing or time\u2010limited (for example, groups formed for a specific project). The group made joint decisions for planning and/or delivery and/or evaluation of health services. We excluded studies that involved partnering with consumers for decision\u2010making about an individual's care or treatment, and studies focused on partnering with consumers for health services research (planning, undertaking, or disseminating research), including a health service's management of research (research funding panels, setting research priorities, research ethics, and governance). We included studies which involved partnering with consumers for health provider education, but only when these partnerships included formal group formats (e.g. a training committee or delivering joint training).",
            "Types of studies": "This review included primary, empirical qualitative studies that included a description of the sampling strategy, data collection procedures and the type of data analysis undertaken (Hannes 2011). We also included the qualitative component of mixed methods studies. We excluded opinion pieces, vignettes and editorials.",
            "Types of settings": "The setting for outcomes of the partnering approaches was health services. For the purposes of this review, health services were defined as healthcare organisations that provided direct care to patients in primary settings (e.g. community health centre, general practitioner practice), secondary settings (e.g. specialist outpatient clinics), or tertiary settings (e.g. hospitals). We also included home and residential services but only when the primary focus was on providing health or nursing care (e.g. home\u2010based nursing services, nursing homes, residential rehabilitation services or hospices). Studies from rural and urban settings were eligible for inclusion, as well as those from high\u2010income and low\u2010 and middle\u2010income countries.",
            "Types of participants": "For the purposes of the QES, the terms 'consumer' and 'health provider' were defined as follows. 'Consumer' referred to a person who was a patient, carer or community member who brought their perspective to health service partnerships. The term also included consultants who were employed by the health service to represent the patient or carer perspective.    'Health provider' referred to a person who had a health policy, management, administrative, or clinical role and who participated in formal partnerships in an advisory or representative capacity. A health provider did not include a person whose primary role was a health researcher. 'Consumer' referred to a person who was a patient, carer or community member who brought their perspective to health service partnerships. The term also included consultants who were employed by the health service to represent the patient or carer perspective. 'Health provider' referred to a person who had a health policy, management, administrative, or clinical role and who participated in formal partnerships in an advisory or representative capacity. A health provider did not include a person whose primary role was a health researcher. We excluded health provider participants who assumed the role of consumers in a partnership, as their primary role was to represent providers rather than consumers. We analysed data from consumer and health provider participants separately, when possible. We included the findings of studies when the views of consumers or health providers were combined, as long as the findings addressed the objectives of this review. We also included data where consumer or health provider views were combined with other types of participants (e.g. community development officers). However, when analysed separately, we did not include the views of other types of participants.",
            "Search methods for identification of studies": "We searched the following databases on 3 October 2018: MEDLINE (OvidSP) (1946 to 2 October 2018).   Embase (OvidSP) (1947 to 2 October 2018).   PsycINFO (OvidSP) (1806 to 2 October 2018).   CINAHL (EBSCO) (1937 to 2 October 2018). MEDLINE (OvidSP) (1946 to 2 October 2018). Embase (OvidSP) (1947 to 2 October 2018). PsycINFO (OvidSP) (1806 to 2 October 2018). CINAHL (EBSCO) (1937 to 2 October 2018). Consistent with a qualitative paradigm, a purposive sampling approach was used to develop the search strategy, rather than an exhaustive and comprehensive approach (Noyes 2022). Informal scoping searches of our topic in MEDLINE showed a proliferation of studies about partnering with consumers published after 2000. Our search results were therefore limited by publication date and we considered studies published from January 2000. We also restricted the search to English language studies only due to the challenges associated with translating qualitative research articles, and a lack of translating expertise within the author team (i.e. no two members of the research team spoke the same language other than English). This decision was informed by the language restrictions used in a previous Cochrane QES (see\u00a0Ames 2017). There were no geographic restrictions. We present the search strategies in\u00a0Appendix 1\u00a0to\u00a0Appendix 2. The strategies were developed by the Information Specialist for Cochrane Consumers and Communication and were informed by searching guidelines from the Cochrane Qualitative and Implementation Methods Group (Harris 2018). After a review of preliminary search results, we applied the McMaster University Health Information Research Unit qualitative filter (Wong 2004) to increase specificity (consistent with our purposive sampling approach). On testing, this filter has been shown to have 61% sensitivity, 99% specificity, 37% precision and 99% accuracy. We searched the ProQuest Theses and Dissertations database. In March 2019, using keywords, we also searched the websites of key national and international organisations involved in promoting person\u2010centred care, including The King's Fund (https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/), The Health Foundation (https://www.health.org.uk), National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (https://www.nice.org.uk), Planetree (https://www.planetree.org), Picker Institute Europe (https://www.picker.org), Institute for Health Improvement (www.ihi.org), World Health Organization (https://www.who.int), Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care (https://www.safetyandquality.gov.au/), and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (https://www.ahrq.gov). We also searched reference lists of sampled studies and relevant systematic reviews. This resulted in the identification of a further 127 studies that were not in the databases above. Additionally, we searched the included studies in the linked intervention review by\u00a0Lowe 2021\u00a0for eligible qualitative trial sibling studies.",

            "Data collection and analysis": "All titles and abstracts were screened independently by at least two review authors (BM, LS, DL, LW, LGW, CC, CG). Using\u00a0Covidence\u00a0software, each author classified each title and abstract as either irrelevant ('no'), relevant (yes') or potentially relevant ('maybe'). Studies were classified as 'irrelevant' if two review authors graded as 'no'. Where there was a combination of yes/no or maybe/no, then the conflict was resolved either through discussion or consulting a third review author. Studies that were graded yes/yes or maybe/yes or maybe/maybe progressed to full\u2010text review. Each full\u2010text article was screened for inclusion or exclusion by at least two people independently. This included screening by Stakeholder Panel members (CW, NR, DM, FM, RC, MG, AM, PB, SB) and at least one member of the research team (BM, LS, DL, LW, CC, SH). Discrepancies were resolved by discussion or by consulting a third review author. We listed all potentially relevant papers excluded from the review at this stage as excluded studies, with reasons provided in the 'Characteristics of excluded studies' table. We reported the screening and selection process in an adapted PRISMA flow chart shown in\u00a0Figure 1\u00a0(Liberati 2009). We identified 182 studies that met our inclusion criteria. PRISMA flow diagram Given the high number of included studies and large volume of data, synthesising all of the studies would have threatened the quality of the synthesis (Cochrane EPOC 2017). Therefore, we used purposive sampling to reduce the number of included studies to a manageable amount. Our sampling frame involved these three steps. 1. All eligible studies were initially rated by one review author (BM, LS or SH) using the 5\u2010point data richness scale developed by\u00a0Ames 2019. The scale ranks data richness from 1 (very little qualitative data related to the synthesis objective) to 5 (a large amount and depth of qualitative data that relate in depth to the synthesis objective). A second review author (BM, SH or LS) checked the ratings and disagreements were resolved by consensus or consulting a third review author. Any studies rated 4 of 5 by at least one author progressed to the next step. 2. One review author (SH) sampled to achieve balance across the following criteria. Country and income region (e.g. low\u2010 and middle\u2010income countries, high\u2010income countries)   Jurisdictional and geographical setting (e.g. provincial or state, rural or metropolitan)   Service type (e.g. tertiary or primary health service)   Service provision purpose (e.g. cancer, mental health, emergency department, all areas)   Purpose of partnering (e.g. quality improvement, health service governance, evaluation)   Breadth of services covered (e.g. partnering across a range of services compared to studies focusing on a single service)    Populations (e.g. consumers, carers, health professionals, managers, policymakers, under\u2010represented populations) Country and income region (e.g. low\u2010 and middle\u2010income countries, high\u2010income countries) Jurisdictional and geographical setting (e.g. provincial or state, rural or metropolitan) Service type (e.g. tertiary or primary health service) Service provision purpose (e.g. cancer, mental health, emergency department, all areas) Purpose of partnering (e.g. quality improvement, health service governance, evaluation) Breadth of services covered (e.g. partnering across a range of services compared to studies focusing on a single service) Populations (e.g. consumers, carers, health professionals, managers, policymakers, under\u2010represented populations) This process was checked by a second review author (BM) and any disagreements were resolved by consensus. 3. Any gaps remaining in the sampling frame were examined and studies with data richness of 3 that would fill the gaps were sought. At the end of this sampling process, 33/182 studies were selected for inclusion in the final synthesis. One review author (LS or BM) then extracted data from each study using a form adapted from Cochrane Consumers and Communication's Data Extraction Template (available at: cccrg.cochrane.org/author-resources) and the\u00a0NICE 2012\u00a0Examples of Evidence Tables for Qualitative Studies. We extracted the following data: details of the study (methodology, data collection and analysis methods, setting, geographic location), details of the participants (number and description of participants, methods of recruitment, sampling and inclusion criteria), details of the partnering approach (type of partnering, participants in the partnering approach). All extracted data were checked for accuracy against the data extraction sheets by a second review author (AV). Data were entered into\u00a0NVivo 2018\u00a0which is software used for analysing qualitative data. One review author entered the data initially (LS) and it was checked for accuracy by a second review author (BM). We appraised the quality of each included study using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) tool (CASP 2018). We chose the CASP because it provided for the assessment of the following domains of methodological strengths and limitations: clear aims and research question, congruence between the aims and the research design, rigour of sampling and data collection to address the question, and appropriate application of the method (Noyes 2018). Five members of the author team with qualitative methods experience (BM, SH, VX, LGW, DL) each assessed the quality of three studies and then a consensus meeting was held to agree on the ratings and determine how the CASP would be applied to the remaining studies. The CASP tool was then applied to each sampled study by one review author (BM, VX, LGW, DL, LS). A second review author, also with qualitative methods experience, checked each appraisal for discrepancies. Any disagreements were resolved through discussion or consultation with a third review author. We did not exclude any studies on the basis of quality because this may have resulted in the loss of valuable insights (Hannes 2011). However, the appraisal formed part of the review authors' judgements when conducting the GRADE\u2010CERQual assessment (Lewin 2018; described below), which determined how much confidence we had in each finding of the synthesis. As per the protocol, we originally intended to conduct a 'Thematic synthesis' of the data (Thomas 2008). We began by selecting the five articles in the sample considered most relevant to the synthesis objective (Croft 2016;\u00a0Johns 2014;\u00a0MacDonald 2015;\u00a0Nathan 2014;\u00a0Sharma 2016). Each of these articles was then coded line\u2010by\u2010line by at least two review authors independently (BM, DL, LGW, VX). After discussing the line\u2010by\u2010line coding process, review authors (BM, DL, LGW, VX) decided to change the synthesis method to 'Framework synthesis' (Oliver 2008) for two reasons. Firstly, we reflected that many of the studies in our QES directly addressed the review objectives and therefore a synthesis method that allowed explicit consideration of the objectives as part of a coding framework would be preferable (Dixon\u2010Woods 2011). Secondly, we considered the time required for line\u2010by\u2010coding of the remaining 28 studies was not feasible within the time available for the project (Booth 2018). Following the change to Framework Synthesis, BM developed a draft framework based on the review objectives, with the most common codes from the line\u2010by\u2010line coding already completed, being categorised under the relevant objective. This draft framework was discussed by BM, DL, LGW and VX, who made further revisions and additions. Once the framework was finalised, the sampled articles were uploaded into\u00a0NVivo 2018. Data in the articles were then indexed against the framework by two review authors (BM, LS). To ensure the authors were coding similarly, BM and LS compared their indexing on five articles. Any differences in coding were discussed and resolved by consensus. Once the review authors established they were applying the framework similarly, only one review author (BM or LS) indexed the remaining articles. Once all articles were indexed, two review authors (BM, LS) began constructing a picture of the data \"as a whole\" by charting emerging themes and sub\u2010themes occurring across the data set. These themes were then tested and refined, by comparing and contrasting data both within and across themes. The final themes were then discussed at a meeting with members of the research team (BM, DL, CC, VX, LGW, SH) as well as a Stakeholder Panel member (CW). Further refinements were then made. The finalised themes became our 'findings' for the purposes of this review. The 19 findings were then grouped into five overarching categories to provide a structured narrative for the Findings section (Ames 2019a). We used the GRADE\u2010CERQual approach to assess confidence in the review findings (Lewin 2018). GRADE\u2010CERQual assesses the extent to which the findings of the review are representative of the phenomenon being explored (Lewin 2018). The assessment is based on four components: the methodological limitations of the studies contributing to the finding; the relevance to the review question of the studies contributing to the review finding; the adequacy of the data supporting the review finding; and the coherence of the review finding (Lewin 2015). After making judgements about these four components, we gave each finding an overall rating of confidence as high, moderate, low or very low. We applied the GRADE\u2010CERQual assessment to each review finding through discussion by two review authors working collaboratively (BM, AV). We have presented a 'CERQual evidence profile' for each finding. This includes the assessment for each CERQual component, the overall CERQual assessment, and the studies contributing to each finding. The 'Summary of Qualitative Findings' tables also included the overall confidence assessment for each finding, and the justification of the confidence assessment. We used a matrix approach to integrate the findings of the QES with the findings of the concurrent\u00a0Lowe 2021\u00a0intervention effects review (Harden 2018). This approach has been used previously by Cochrane authors (see, for example,\u00a0Ames 2019a). As the sampled qualitative articles mainly came from studies unrelated to the trials, the review authors adapted the QES findings into key questions to ask about the design of the interventions. These questions were listed along one side of a matrix with each of the included trials in\u00a0Lowe 2021\u00a0plotted against them. When a question had been addressed in the design of the trial, this was marked as \"y\" for \"yes\". When the question had not been addressed, this was marked as \"n\". This helped to identify which questions were routinely addressed in trials, and the gaps that should be considered when designing future trials. To provide an initial framework for the development of the best practice principles, the key questions used in the matrix approach, which reflected the findings of the review, were adapted into draft statements of best practice. The statements were then considered at a teleconference of the Stakeholder Panel. Members of the panel discussed the principles and formulated key recommendations for changes to the draft principles. Recommendations included the following: that the principles did not sufficiently address the power imbalances in formal partnerships and diversity needed in formal partnerships; that the principles needed to be broader, but supported with additional practical examples from the findings to enhance applicability; that the language of some of the draft principles needed to be strengthened. The draft principles were then revised by BM and SH and further feedback was sought from the Stakeholder Panel via email. Further minor changes were made on the basis of the feedback and the final draft was approved by the review authors and Stakeholder Panel members. Regular meetings of the author team and stakeholder panel enhanced the authors' awareness of their own role in the research process. For example, stakeholder meetings helped the review authors to identify underlying biases in applying the selection criteria to full\u2010text studies. During the data analysis phase, only review authors with qualitative methods experience or training (BM, LS, SH, LGW, VX, LW, DL) were directly involved in coding and quality appraisal of the included studies. These review authors met regularly to uncover underlying assumptions that may have influenced the initial coding and quality appraisal ratings, such as their own interactions with the health system, their professional backgrounds and experiences of consumer involvement in health services and research. These review authors all shared a perspective that consumer involvement in health service design, delivery and evaluation could be improved. The Stakeholder Panel also met to discuss the draft findings. At the meeting, stakeholders were asked for their perceptions of the findings, including any potential gaps in the analysis or unexpected findings. At this stage, some stakeholders expressed surprise that training of health providers was not identified in the findings. Following the meeting, this led to re\u2010checking the primary data with \"health provider training\" as a sensitising concept and realising there was a small, but sufficient, amount of data overlooked in the initial analysis, which suggested that training of health providers about consumer involvement could be useful. Thus, the draft findings were updated with these new data. However, other suggestions for potential missing findings from the stakeholder panel, for example, \"characteristics of effective consumer representatives\", was not found when the data were re\u2010checked and therefore were not included. This process ensured that risk to rigour from competing personal biases was acknowledged and minimised.",

Any studies rated 4 of 5 by at least one author progressed to the next step.  2. One review author (SH) sampled to achieve balance across the following criteria.    Country and income region (e.g. low\u2010 and middle\u2010income countries, high\u2010income countries)   Jurisdictional and geographical setting (e.g. provincial or state, rural or metropolitan)   Service type (e.g. tertiary or primary health service)   Service provision purpose (e.g. cancer, mental health, emergency department, all areas)   Purpose of partnering (e.g. quality improvement, health service governance, evaluation)   Breadth of services covered (e.g. partnering across a range of services compared to studies focusing on a single service)    Populations (e.g. consumers, carers, health professionals, managers, policymakers, under\u2010represented populations)     This process was checked by a second review author (BM) and any disagreements were resolved by consensus.  3. Any gaps remaining in the sampling frame were examined and studies with data richness of 3 that would fill the gaps were sought.  At the end of this sampling process, 33/182 studies were selected for inclusion in the final synthesis.  One review author (LS or BM) then extracted data from each study using a form adapted from Cochrane Consumers and Communication's Data Extraction Template (available at: cccrg.cochrane.org/author-resources) and the\u00a0NICE 2012\u00a0Examples of Evidence Tables for Qualitative Studies. We extracted the following data: details of the study (methodology, data collection and analysis methods, setting, geographic location), details of the participants (number and description of participants, methods of recruitment, sampling and inclusion criteria), details of the partnering approach (type of partnering, participants in the partnering approach). All extracted data were checked for accuracy against the data extraction sheets by a second review author (AV).  Data were entered into\u00a0NVivo 2018\u00a0which is software used for analysing qualitative data. One review author entered the data initially (LS) and it was checked for accuracy by a second review author (BM).   Appraisal of study quality We appraised the quality of each included study using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) tool (CASP 2018). We chose the CASP because it provided for the assessment of the following domains of methodological strengths and limitations: clear aims and research question, congruence between the aims and the research design, rigour of sampling and data collection to address the question, and appropriate application of the method (Noyes 2018). Five members of the author team with qualitative methods experience (BM, SH, VX, LGW, DL) each assessed the quality of three studies and then a consensus meeting was held to agree on the ratings and determine how the CASP would be applied to the remaining studies.  The CASP tool was then applied to each sampled study by one review author (BM, VX, LGW, DL, LS). A second review author, also with qualitative methods experience, checked each appraisal for discrepancies. Any disagreements were resolved through discussion or consultation with a third review author. We did not exclude any studies on the basis of quality because this may have resulted in the loss of valuable insights (Hannes 2011). However, the appraisal formed part of the review authors' judgements when conducting the GRADE\u2010CERQual assessment (Lewin 2018; described below), which determined how much confidence we had in each finding of the synthesis.    Data synthesis As per the protocol, we originally intended to conduct a 'Thematic synthesis' of the data (Thomas 2008). We began by selecting the five articles in the sample considered most relevant to the synthesis objective (Croft 2016;\u00a0Johns 2014;\u00a0MacDonald 2015;\u00a0Nathan 2014;\u00a0Sharma 2016). Each of these articles was then coded line\u2010by\u2010line by at least two review authors independently (BM, DL, LGW, VX). After discussing the line\u2010by\u2010line coding process, review authors (BM, DL, LGW, VX) decided to change the synthesis method to 'Framework synthesis' (Oliver 2008) for two reasons. Firstly, we reflected that many of the studies in our QES directly addressed the review objectives and therefore a synthesis method that allowed explicit consideration of the objectives as part of a coding framework would be preferable (Dixon\u2010Woods 2011). Secondly, we considered the time required for line\u2010by\u2010coding of the remaining 28 studies was not feasible within the time available for the project (Booth 2018). Following the change to Framework Synthesis, BM developed a draft framework based on the review objectives, with the most common codes from the line\u2010by\u2010line coding already completed, being categorised under the relevant objective. This draft framework was discussed by BM, DL, LGW and VX, who made further revisions and additions.  Once the framework was finalised, the sampled articles were uploaded into\u00a0NVivo 2018. Data in the articles were then indexed against the framework by two review authors (BM, LS). To ensure the authors were coding similarly, BM and LS compared their indexing on five articles. Any differences in coding were discussed and resolved by consensus. Once the review authors established they were applying the framework similarly, only one review author (BM or LS) indexed the remaining articles.  Once all articles were indexed, two review authors (BM, LS) began constructing a picture of the data \"as a whole\" by charting emerging themes and sub\u2010themes occurring across the data set. These themes were then tested and refined, by comparing and contrasting data both within and across themes. The final themes were then discussed at a meeting with members of the research team (BM, DL, CC, VX, LGW, SH) as well as a Stakeholder Panel member (CW). Further refinements were then made. The finalised themes became our 'findings' for the purposes of this review. The 19 findings were then grouped into five overarching categories to provide a structured narrative for the Findings section (Ames 2019a).    Assessment of confidence in the review findings We used the GRADE\u2010CERQual approach to assess confidence in the review findings (Lewin 2018). GRADE\u2010CERQual assesses the extent to which the findings of the review are representative of the phenomenon being explored (Lewin 2018). The assessment is based on four components: the methodological limitations of the studies contributing to the finding; the relevance to the review question of the studies contributing to the review finding; the adequacy of the data supporting the review finding; and the coherence of the review finding (Lewin 2015). After making judgements about these four components, we gave each finding an overall rating of confidence as high, moderate, low or very low. We applied the GRADE\u2010CERQual assessment to each review finding through discussion by two review authors working collaboratively (BM, AV). We have presented a 'CERQual evidence profile' for each finding. This includes the assessment for each CERQual component, the overall CERQual assessment, and the studies contributing to each finding. The 'Summary of Qualitative Findings' tables also included the overall confidence assessment for each finding, and the justification of the confidence assessment.    Using the synthesised qualitative findings to supplement a published Cochrane effectiveness review  We used a matrix approach to integrate the findings of the QES with the findings of the concurrent\u00a0Lowe 2021\u00a0intervention effects review (Harden 2018). This approach has been used previously by Cochrane authors (see, for example,\u00a0Ames 2019a). As the sampled qualitative articles mainly came from studies unrelated to the trials, the review authors adapted the QES findings into key questions to ask about the design of the interventions. These questions were listed along one side of a matrix with each of the included trials in\u00a0Lowe 2021\u00a0plotted against them. When a question had been addressed in the design of the trial, this was marked as \"y\" for \"yes\". When the question had not been addressed, this was marked as \"n\". This helped to identify which questions were routinely addressed in trials, and the gaps that should be considered when designing future trials.    Developing the best practice principles To provide an initial framework for the development of the best practice principles, the key questions used in the matrix approach, which reflected the findings of the review, were adapted into draft statements of best practice. The statements were then considered at a teleconference of the Stakeholder Panel. Members of the panel discussed the principles and formulated key recommendations for changes to the draft principles. Recommendations included the following: that the principles did not sufficiently address the power imbalances in formal partnerships and diversity needed in formal partnerships; that the principles needed to be broader, but supported with additional practical examples from the findings to enhance applicability; that the language of some of the draft principles needed to be strengthened. The draft principles were then revised by BM and SH and further feedback was sought from the Stakeholder Panel via email. Further minor changes were made on the basis of the feedback and the final draft was approved by the review authors and Stakeholder Panel members.    Author reflexivity Regular meetings of the author team and stakeholder panel enhanced the authors' awareness of their own role in the research process. For example, stakeholder meetings helped the review authors to identify underlying biases in applying the selection criteria to full\u2010text studies. During the data analysis phase, only review authors with qualitative methods experience or training (BM, LS, SH, LGW, VX, LW, DL) were directly involved in coding and quality appraisal of the included studies. These review authors met regularly to uncover underlying assumptions that may have influenced the initial coding and quality appraisal ratings, such as their own interactions with the health system, their professional backgrounds and experiences of consumer involvement in health services and research. These review authors all shared a perspective that consumer involvement in health service design, delivery and evaluation could be improved.  The Stakeholder Panel also met to discuss the draft findings. At the meeting, stakeholders were asked for their perceptions of the findings, including any potential gaps in the analysis or unexpected findings. At this stage, some stakeholders expressed surprise that training of health providers was not identified in the findings. Following the meeting, this led to re\u2010checking the primary data with \"health provider training\" as a sensitising concept and realising there was a small, but sufficient, amount of data overlooked in the initial analysis, which suggested that training of health providers about consumer involvement could be useful. Thus, the draft findings were updated with these new data. However, other suggestions for potential missing findings from the stakeholder panel, for example, \"characteristics of effective consumer representatives\", was not found when the data were re\u2010checked and therefore were not included. This process ensured that risk to rigour from competing personal biases was acknowledged and minimised."

Finding 6. Positive interpersonal dynamics between health providers and consumers that facilitated partnerships. Mutual respect, commitment, two way dialogue and information exchange were helpful. Trust, accountability, regular group communication and strong relationships with decision\u2010makers were also facilitators. Partnerships that were equitable with shared values, a shared vision and shared decision\u2010making powers were preferable. Skilled facilitators, moderators and consumer coordinators could help to facilitate positive interpersonal dynamics.

Finding 13. Working in partnership could affect health providers and consumer participants in both positive and negative ways. Health providers perceived consumers provided a unique perspective that could improve services, but they were concerned about the time pressures and unmet expectations that could accompany their involvement in partnerships. Consumers perceived there were benefits of working in partnership, including empowerment, increased confidence, knowledge and skills. However, they reported that participating in partnerships could be physically and/or emotionally demanding.

Expanded matrix table": "Based on the findings of the QES, we explored whether the trialists had described the following aspects of working in partnership:     Was the partnership conducted in a supportive government policy context?   Was the partnership conducted in a supportive organisational context?   Were consumers involved in the recruitment process?   Were resources in place to recruit and support members from groups who are underserved?   If expected to represent other consumers, were consumers facilitated to do this (e.g. with data, peer networks etc)?    Were strategies used to facilitate positive interpersonal dynamics in the partnership?   Were consumers offered training and practical support to facilitate their participation in the partnership?    Were consumers and health providers both clear about the expectations of the consumer role, and were consumers involved in shaping their role?    Were strategies used to decrease the potential for consumers to feel intimidated a) in a formal group formats and b) working with health providers?    Were strategies used to ensure consumers could contribute meaningfully to the agenda, including leading the meeting and/or contributing their own priorities?    Were consumers involved meaningfully in decision\u2010making in the partnership?   Were strategies used to reduce negative effects of partnerships on both health providers and consumers?

            "Appendix 9. Glossary of key terms": "Consumers: for the purposes of this review, consumers were defined a patient, carer or community member who brought their perspective to health service partnerships. The term also included consultants who were employed by the health service to represent the patient or carer perspective. This definition is a simplified version of that used in the companion intervention effects review (Lowe 2021).  Formal group partnerships: for the purposes of this review, formal group partnerships were defined as consumers and health providers meeting jointly and regularly in formal group formats (e.g. committees, councils, working groups) to share decision\u2010making for the purpose of planning, delivery or evaluation in one or more health service(s). The same definition was used in the companion intervention effects review (Lowe 2021).  Health providers: for the purposes of this review, health providers referred to a person who had a health policy, management, administrative, or clinical role and who participated in formal partnerships in an advisory or representative capacity. A health provider did not include a person whose primary role was a health researcher. This definition is a simplified version of that used in the companion intervention effects review (Lowe 2021).  Health services: defined as public or privately funded services that provide direct care to consumers in primary (e.g. community health centres, general practitioner practices, private practices, dispensaries), secondary (e.g. specialist outpatient clinics), or tertiary settings (e.g. hospitals). We included home and residential services only when they were primarily providing health or nursing care (e.g. home\u2010based nursing services, nursing homes, residential rehabilitation services, or hospices). The same definition was used in the companion intervention effects review (Lowe 2021).  Intervention effects review: in a systematic review of intervention effects, the researchers aim to locate, assess the risk of bias, and synthesise all of the available evidence related to a specific research question about the effects of an intervention. The companion intervention effects review by\u00a0Lowe 2021\u00a0addressed the question \u2018what are the effects of consumers and health providers working in partnership on health services planning, delivery and evaluation'?\u00a0  Partnering (as an intervention): For the purposes of this review, the intervention was defined as:     consumers and health providers engaged in formal group formats, such as committees, councils, boards or steering groups;    the group involved at least one consumer and at least one health provider;   the group met jointly, more than once via face\u2010to\u2010face or electronic modes;   the group was either ongoing or time\u2010limited (for example, groups formed for a specific project);    the group made joint decisions for planning and/or delivery and/or evaluation of health services.     The same definition was used in the companion intervention effects review (Lowe 2021).  Qualitative evidence synthesis: in a systematic review of qualitative evidence, the researchers aim to locate, assess the methodological quality, and synthesise evidence related to a specific research question about the experience of a phenomenon. When combined with an intervention effects review, the qualitative evidence synthesis aims to help understand how the intervention works, for whom, and in what context, and how best to implement it (Flemming 2019). In this case, the question is \u2018what are consumers and health providers\u2019 views and experiences of partnering to improve health services planning, delivery and evaluation'?"
        },
        "criteria_text": "We included qualitative studies that focused on working in formal group partnerships to improve planning, delivery or evaluation of health services. Partnering is defined as \"healthcare organisations, healthcare providers and policymakers actively working with people who use the healthcare system to ensure that health information and services meet people's needs\" (ACSQHC 2018). For the purposes of this review, formal group partnerships were operationalised as consumers and health providers meeting jointly and regularly in formal group formats (e.g. committees, councils, working groups) to share decision\u2010making for the purpose of planning, delivery or evaluation in one or more health service(s). Studies meeting the following criteria were eligible for inclusion. Consumers and health providers were engaged in formal group formats, such as committees, councils, boards or steering groups.    The group involved at least one consumer and at least one health provider.   The group met jointly, more than once via face\u2010to\u2010face or electronic modes.   The group was either ongoing or time\u2010limited (for example, groups formed for a specific project).    The group made joint decisions for planning and/or delivery and/or evaluation of health services. Consumers and health providers were engaged in formal group formats, such as committees, councils, boards or steering groups. The group involved at least one consumer and at least one health provider. The group met jointly, more than once via face\u2010to\u2010face or electronic modes. The group was either ongoing or time\u2010limited (for example, groups formed for a specific project). The group made joint decisions for planning and/or delivery and/or evaluation of health services. We excluded studies that involved partnering with consumers for decision\u2010making about an individual's care or treatment, and studies focused on partnering with consumers for health services research (planning, undertaking, or disseminating research), including a health service's management of research (research funding panels, setting research priorities, research ethics, and governance). We included studies which involved partnering with consumers for health provider education, but only when these partnerships included formal group formats (e.g. a training committee or delivering joint training). This review included primary, empirical qualitative studies that included a description of the sampling strategy, data collection procedures and the type of data analysis undertaken (Hannes 2011). We also included the qualitative component of mixed methods studies. We excluded opinion pieces, vignettes and editorials. The setting for outcomes of the partnering approaches was health services. For the purposes of this review, health services were defined as healthcare organisations that provided direct care to patients in primary settings (e.g. community health centre, general practitioner practice), secondary settings (e.g. specialist outpatient clinics), or tertiary settings (e.g. hospitals). We also included home and residential services but only when the primary focus was on providing health or nursing care (e.g. home\u2010based nursing services, nursing homes, residential rehabilitation services or hospices). Studies from rural and urban settings were eligible for inclusion, as well as those from high\u2010income and low\u2010 and middle\u2010income countries. For the purposes of the QES, the terms 'consumer' and 'health provider' were defined as follows. 'Consumer' referred to a person who was a patient, carer or community member who brought their perspective to health service partnerships. The term also included consultants who were employed by the health service to represent the patient or carer perspective.    'Health provider' referred to a person who had a health policy, management, administrative, or clinical role and who participated in formal partnerships in an advisory or representative capacity. A health provider did not include a person whose primary role was a health researcher. 'Consumer' referred to a person who was a patient, carer or community member who brought their perspective to health service partnerships. The term also included consultants who were employed by the health service to represent the patient or carer perspective. 'Health provider' referred to a person who had a health policy, management, administrative, or clinical role and who participated in formal partnerships in an advisory or representative capacity. A health provider did not include a person whose primary role was a health researcher. We excluded health provider participants who assumed the role of consumers in a partnership, as their primary role was to represent providers rather than consumers. We analysed data from consumer and health provider participants separately, when possible. We included the findings of studies when the views of consumers or health providers were combined, as long as the findings addressed the objectives of this review. We also included data where consumer or health provider views were combined with other types of participants (e.g. community development officers). However, when analysed separately, we did not include the views of other types of participants. We searched the following databases on 3 October 2018: MEDLINE (OvidSP) (1946 to 2 October 2018).   Embase (OvidSP) (1947 to 2 October 2018).   PsycINFO (OvidSP) (1806 to 2 October 2018).   CINAHL (EBSCO) (1937 to 2 October 2018). MEDLINE (OvidSP) (1946 to 2 October 2018). Embase (OvidSP) (1947 to 2 October 2018). PsycINFO (OvidSP) (1806 to 2 October 2018). CINAHL (EBSCO) (1937 to 2 October 2018). Consistent with a qualitative paradigm, a purposive sampling approach was used to develop the search strategy, rather than an exhaustive and comprehensive approach (Noyes 2022). Informal scoping searches of our topic in MEDLINE showed a proliferation of studies about partnering with consumers published after 2000. Our search results were therefore limited by publication date and we considered studies published from January 2000. We also restricted the search to English language studies only due to the challenges associated with translating qualitative research articles, and a lack of translating expertise within the author team (i.e. no two members of the research team spoke the same language other than English). This decision was informed by the language restrictions used in a previous Cochrane QES (see\u00a0Ames 2017). There were no geographic restrictions. We present the search strategies in\u00a0Appendix 1\u00a0to\u00a0Appendix 2. The strategies were developed by the Information Specialist for Cochrane Consumers and Communication and were informed by searching guidelines from the Cochrane Qualitative and Implementation Methods Group (Harris 2018). After a review of preliminary search results, we applied the McMaster University Health Information Research Unit qualitative filter (Wong 2004) to increase specificity (consistent with our purposive sampling approach). On testing, this filter has been shown to have 61% sensitivity, 99% specificity, 37% precision and 99% accuracy. We searched the ProQuest Theses and Dissertations database. In March 2019, using keywords, we also searched the websites of key national and international organisations involved in promoting person\u2010centred care, including The King's Fund (https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/), The Health Foundation (https://www.health.org.uk), National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (https://www.nice.org.uk), Planetree (https://www.planetree.org), Picker Institute Europe (https://www.picker.org), Institute for Health Improvement (www.ihi.org), World Health Organization (https://www.who.int), Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care (https://www.safetyandquality.gov.au/), and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (https://www.ahrq.gov). We also searched reference lists of sampled studies and relevant systematic reviews. This resulted in the identification of a further 127 studies that were not in the databases above. Additionally, we searched the included studies in the linked intervention review by\u00a0Lowe 2021\u00a0for eligible qualitative trial sibling studies. We searched the following databases on 3 October 2018:    MEDLINE (OvidSP) (1946 to 2 October 2018).   Embase (OvidSP) (1947 to 2 October 2018).   PsycINFO (OvidSP) (1806 to 2 October 2018).

We also searched reference lists of sampled studies and relevant systematic reviews. This resulted in the identification of a further 127 studies that were not in the databases above.  Additionally, we searched the included studies in the linked intervention review by\u00a0Lowe 2021\u00a0for eligible qualitative trial sibling studies. All titles and abstracts were screened independently by at least two review authors (BM, LS, DL, LW, LGW, CC, CG). Using\u00a0Covidence\u00a0software, each author classified each title and abstract as either irrelevant ('no'), relevant (yes') or potentially relevant ('maybe'). Studies were classified as 'irrelevant' if two review authors graded as 'no'. Where there was a combination of yes/no or maybe/no, then the conflict was resolved either through discussion or consulting a third review author. Studies that were graded yes/yes or maybe/yes or maybe/maybe progressed to full\u2010text review. Each full\u2010text article was screened for inclusion or exclusion by at least two people independently. This included screening by Stakeholder Panel members (CW, NR, DM, FM, RC, MG, AM, PB, SB) and at least one member of the research team (BM, LS, DL, LW, CC, SH). Discrepancies were resolved by discussion or by consulting a third review author. We listed all potentially relevant papers excluded from the review at this stage as excluded studies, with reasons provided in the 'Characteristics of excluded studies' table. We reported the screening and selection process in an adapted PRISMA flow chart shown in\u00a0Figure 1\u00a0(Liberati 2009). We identified 182 studies that met our inclusion criteria. PRISMA flow diagram Given the high number of included studies and large volume of data, synthesising all of the studies would have threatened the quality of the synthesis (Cochrane EPOC 2017). Therefore, we used purposive sampling to reduce the number of included studies to a manageable amount. Our sampling frame involved these three steps. 1. All eligible studies were initially rated by one review author (BM, LS or SH) using the 5\u2010point data richness scale developed by\u00a0Ames 2019. The scale ranks data richness from 1 (very little qualitative data related to the synthesis objective) to 5 (a large amount and depth of qualitative data that relate in depth to the synthesis objective). A second review author (BM, SH or LS) checked the ratings and disagreements were resolved by consensus or consulting a third review author. Any studies rated 4 of 5 by at least one author progressed to the next step. 2. One review author (SH) sampled to achieve balance across the following criteria. Country and income region (e.g. low\u2010 and middle\u2010income countries, high\u2010income countries)   Jurisdictional and geographical setting (e.g. provincial or state, rural or metropolitan)   Service type (e.g. tertiary or primary health service)   Service provision purpose (e.g. cancer, mental health, emergency department, all areas)   Purpose of partnering (e.g. quality improvement, health service governance, evaluation)   Breadth of services covered (e.g. partnering across a range of services compared to studies focusing on a single service)    Populations (e.g. consumers, carers, health professionals, managers, policymakers, under\u2010represented populations) Country and income region (e.g. low\u2010 and middle\u2010income countries, high\u2010income countries) Jurisdictional and geographical setting (e.g. provincial or state, rural or metropolitan) Service type (e.g. tertiary or primary health service) Service provision purpose (e.g. cancer, mental health, emergency department, all areas) Purpose of partnering (e.g. quality improvement, health service governance, evaluation) Breadth of services covered (e.g. partnering across a range of services compared to studies focusing on a single service) Populations (e.g. consumers, carers, health professionals, managers, policymakers, under\u2010represented populations) This process was checked by a second review author (BM) and any disagreements were resolved by consensus. 3. Any gaps remaining in the sampling frame were examined and studies with data richness of 3 that would fill the gaps were sought. At the end of this sampling process, 33/182 studies were selected for inclusion in the final synthesis. One review author (LS or BM) then extracted data from each study using a form adapted from Cochrane Consumers and Communication's Data Extraction Template (available at: cccrg.cochrane.org/author-resources) and the\u00a0NICE 2012\u00a0Examples of Evidence Tables for Qualitative Studies. We extracted the following data: details of the study (methodology, data collection and analysis methods, setting, geographic location), details of the participants (number and description of participants, methods of recruitment, sampling and inclusion criteria), details of the partnering approach (type of partnering, participants in the partnering approach). All extracted data were checked for accuracy against the data extraction sheets by a second review author (AV). Data were entered into\u00a0NVivo 2018\u00a0which is software used for analysing qualitative data. One review author entered the data initially (LS) and it was checked for accuracy by a second review author (BM). We appraised the quality of each included study using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) tool (CASP 2018). We chose the CASP because it provided for the assessment of the following domains of methodological strengths and limitations: clear aims and research question, congruence between the aims and the research design, rigour of sampling and data collection to address the question, and appropriate application of the method (Noyes 2018). Five members of the author team with qualitative methods experience (BM, SH, VX, LGW, DL) each assessed the quality of three studies and then a consensus meeting was held to agree on the ratings and determine how the CASP would be applied to the remaining studies. The CASP tool was then applied to each sampled study by one review author (BM, VX, LGW, DL, LS). A second review author, also with qualitative methods experience, checked each appraisal for discrepancies. Any disagreements were resolved through discussion or consultation with a third review author. We did not exclude any studies on the basis of quality because this may have resulted in the loss of valuable insights (Hannes 2011). However, the appraisal formed part of the review authors' judgements when conducting the GRADE\u2010CERQual assessment (Lewin 2018; described below), which determined how much confidence we had in each finding of the synthesis. As per the protocol, we originally intended to conduct a 'Thematic synthesis' of the data (Thomas 2008). We began by selecting the five articles in the sample considered most relevant to the synthesis objective (Croft 2016;\u00a0Johns 2014;\u00a0MacDonald 2015;\u00a0Nathan 2014;\u00a0Sharma 2016). Each of these articles was then coded line\u2010by\u2010line by at least two review authors independently (BM, DL, LGW, VX). After discussing the line\u2010by\u2010line coding process, review authors (BM, DL, LGW, VX) decided to change the synthesis method to 'Framework synthesis' (Oliver 2008) for two reasons. Firstly, we reflected that many of the studies in our QES directly addressed the review objectives and therefore a synthesis method that allowed explicit consideration of the objectives as part of a coding framework would be preferable (Dixon\u2010Woods 2011). Secondly, we considered the time required for line\u2010by\u2010coding of the remaining 28 studies was not feasible within the time available for the project (Booth 2018). Following the change to Framework Synthesis, BM developed a draft framework based on the review objectives, with the most common codes from the line\u2010by\u2010line coding already completed, being categorised under the relevant objective. This draft framework was discussed by BM, DL, LGW and VX, who made further revisions and additions. Once the framework was finalised, the sampled articles were uploaded into\u00a0NVivo 2018. Data in the articles were then indexed against the framework by two review authors (BM, LS). To ensure the authors were coding similarly, BM and LS compared their indexing on five articles. Any differences in coding were discussed and resolved by consensus. Once the review authors established they were applying the framework similarly, only one review author (BM or LS) indexed the remaining articles. Once all articles were indexed, two review authors (BM, LS) began constructing a picture of the data \"as a whole\" by charting emerging themes and sub\u2010themes occurring across the data set. These themes were then tested and refined, by comparing and contrasting data both within and across themes. The final themes were then discussed at a meeting with members of the research team (BM, DL, CC, VX, LGW, SH) as well as a Stakeholder Panel member (CW). Further refinements were then made. The finalised themes became our 'findings' for the purposes of this review. The 19 findings were then grouped into five overarching categories to provide a structured narrative for the Findings section (Ames 2019a). We used the GRADE\u2010CERQual approach to assess confidence in the review findings (Lewin 2018). GRADE\u2010CERQual assesses the extent to which the findings of the review are representative of the phenomenon being explored (Lewin 2018). The assessment is based on four components: the methodological limitations of the studies contributing to the finding; the relevance to the review question of the studies contributing to the review finding; the adequacy of the data supporting the review finding; and the coherence of the review finding (Lewin 2015). After making judgements about these four components, we gave each finding an overall rating of confidence as high, moderate, low or very low. We applied the GRADE\u2010CERQual assessment to each review finding through discussion by two review authors working collaboratively (BM, AV). We have presented a 'CERQual evidence profile' for each finding. This includes the assessment for each CERQual component, the overall CERQual assessment, and the studies contributing to each finding. The 'Summary of Qualitative Findings' tables also included the overall confidence assessment for each finding, and the justification of the confidence assessment. We used a matrix approach to integrate the findings of the QES with the findings of the concurrent\u00a0Lowe 2021\u00a0intervention effects review (Harden 2018). This approach has been used previously by Cochrane authors (see, for example,\u00a0Ames 2019a). As the sampled qualitative articles mainly came from studies unrelated to the trials, the review authors adapted the QES findings into key questions to ask about the design of the interventions. These questions were listed along one side of a matrix with each of the included trials in\u00a0Lowe 2021\u00a0plotted against them. When a question had been addressed in the design of the trial, this was marked as \"y\" for \"yes\". When the question had not been addressed, this was marked as \"n\". This helped to identify which questions were routinely addressed in trials, and the gaps that should be considered when designing future trials. To provide an initial framework for the development of the best practice principles, the key questions used in the matrix approach, which reflected the findings of the review, were adapted into draft statements of best practice. The statements were then considered at a teleconference of the Stakeholder Panel. Members of the panel discussed the principles and formulated key recommendations for changes to the draft principles. Recommendations included the following: that the principles did not sufficiently address the power imbalances in formal partnerships and diversity needed in formal partnerships; that the principles needed to be broader, but supported with additional practical examples from the findings to enhance applicability; that the language of some of the draft principles needed to be strengthened. The draft principles were then revised by BM and SH and further feedback was sought from the Stakeholder Panel via email. Further minor changes were made on the basis of the feedback and the final draft was approved by the review authors and Stakeholder Panel members. Regular meetings of the author team and stakeholder panel enhanced the authors' awareness of their own role in the research process. For example, stakeholder meetings helped the review authors to identify underlying biases in applying the selection criteria to full\u2010text studies. During the data analysis phase, only review authors with qualitative methods experience or training (BM, LS, SH, LGW, VX, LW, DL) were directly involved in coding and quality appraisal of the included studies. These review authors met regularly to uncover underlying assumptions that may have influenced the initial coding and quality appraisal ratings, such as their own interactions with the health system, their professional backgrounds and experiences of consumer involvement in health services and research. These review authors all shared a perspective that consumer involvement in health service design, delivery and evaluation could be improved. The Stakeholder Panel also met to discuss the draft findings. At the meeting, stakeholders were asked for their perceptions of the findings, including any potential gaps in the analysis or unexpected findings. At this stage, some stakeholders expressed surprise that training of health providers was not identified in the findings. Following the meeting, this led to re\u2010checking the primary data with \"health provider training\" as a sensitising concept and realising there was a small, but sufficient, amount of data overlooked in the initial analysis, which suggested that training of health providers about consumer involvement could be useful. Thus, the draft findings were updated with these new data. However, other suggestions for potential missing findings from the stakeholder panel, for example, \"characteristics of effective consumer representatives\", was not found when the data were re\u2010checked and therefore were not included. This process ensured that risk to rigour from competing personal biases was acknowledged and minimised. Data extraction and management All titles and abstracts were screened independently by at least two review authors (BM, LS, DL, LW, LGW, CC, CG). Using\u00a0Covidence\u00a0software, each author classified each title and abstract as either irrelevant ('no'), relevant (yes') or potentially relevant ('maybe'). Studies were classified as 'irrelevant' if two review authors graded as 'no'. Where there was a combination of yes/no or maybe/no, then the conflict was resolved either through discussion or consulting a third review author. Studies that were graded yes/yes or maybe/yes or maybe/maybe progressed to full\u2010text review.  Each full\u2010text article was screened for inclusion or exclusion by at least two people independently. This included screening by Stakeholder Panel members (CW, NR, DM, FM, RC, MG, AM, PB, SB) and at least one member of the research team (BM, LS, DL, LW, CC, SH). Discrepancies were resolved by discussion or by consulting a third review author. We listed all potentially relevant papers excluded from the review at this stage as excluded studies, with reasons provided in the 'Characteristics of excluded studies' table. We reported the screening and selection process in an adapted PRISMA flow chart shown in\u00a0Figure 1\u00a0(Liberati 2009). We identified 182 studies that met our inclusion criteria.      Open in figure viewer   Figure 1     PRISMA flow diagram  Given the high number of included studies and large volume of data, synthesising all of the studies would have threatened the quality of the synthesis (Cochrane EPOC 2017). Therefore, we used purposive sampling to reduce the number of included studies to a manageable amount. Our sampling frame involved these three steps.  1. All eligible studies were initially rated by one review author (BM, LS or SH) using the 5\u2010point data richness scale developed by\u00a0Ames 2019. The scale ranks data richness from 1 (very little qualitative data related to the synthesis objective) to 5 (a large amount and depth of qualitative data that relate in depth to the synthesis objective). A second review author (BM, SH or LS) checked the ratings and disagreements were resolved by consensus or consulting a third review author. Any studies rated 4 of 5 by at least one author progressed to the next step.  2. One review author (SH) sampled to achieve balance across the following criteria.    Country and income region (e.g. low\u2010 and middle\u2010income countries, high\u2010income countries)   Jurisdictional and geographical setting (e.g. provincial or state, rural or metropolitan)   Service type (e.g. tertiary or primary health service)   Service provision purpose (e.g. cancer, mental health, emergency department, all areas)   Purpose of partnering (e.g. quality improvement, health service governance, evaluation)   Breadth of services covered (e.g. partnering across a range of services compared to studies focusing on a single service)    Populations (e.g. consumers, carers, health professionals, managers, policymakers, under\u2010represented populations)     This process was checked by a second review author (BM) and any disagreements were resolved by consensus.  3. Any gaps remaining in the sampling frame were examined and studies with data richness of 3 that would fill the gaps were sought.  At the end of this sampling process, 33/182 studies were selected for inclusion in the final synthesis.  One review author (LS or BM) then extracted data from each study using a form adapted from Cochrane Consumers and Communication's Data Extraction Template (available at: cccrg.cochrane.org/author-resources) and the\u00a0NICE 2012\u00a0Examples of Evidence Tables for Qualitative Studies. We extracted the following data: details of the study (methodology, data collection and analysis methods, setting, geographic location), details of the participants (number and description of participants, methods of recruitment, sampling and inclusion criteria), details of the partnering approach (type of partnering, participants in the partnering approach). All extracted data were checked for accuracy against the data extraction sheets by a second review author (AV).  Data were entered into\u00a0NVivo 2018\u00a0which is software used for analysing qualitative data. One review author entered the data initially (LS) and it was checked for accuracy by a second review author (BM).   Appraisal of study quality We appraised the quality of each included study using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) tool (CASP 2018). We chose the CASP because it provided for the assessment of the following domains of methodological strengths and limitations: clear aims and research question, congruence between the aims and the research design, rigour of sampling and data collection to address the question, and appropriate application of the method (Noyes 2018).

        "abstract": "Background Persistent postural\u2010perceptual dizziness (PPPD) is a chronic balance disorder, which is characterised by subjective unsteadiness or dizziness that is worse on standing and with visual stimulation. The condition was only recently defined and therefore the prevalence is currently unknown. However, it is likely to include a considerable number of people with chronic balance problems. The symptoms can be debilitating and have a profound impact on quality of life. At present, little is known about the optimal way to treat this condition. A variety of medications may be used, as well as other treatments, such as vestibular rehabilitation.\u00a0    Objectives To assess the benefits and harms of non\u2010pharmacological interventions for persistent postural\u2010perceptual dizziness (PPPD).\u00a0    Search methods The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 21 November 2022.    Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi\u2010RCTs in adults with PPPD, which compared any non\u2010pharmacological intervention with either placebo or no treatment. We excluded studies that did not use the B\u00e1r\u00e1ny Society criteria to diagnose PPPD, and studies that followed up participants for less than three months.\u00a0    Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were: 1) improvement in vestibular symptoms (assessed as a dichotomous outcome \u2010 improved or not improved), 2) change in vestibular symptoms (assessed as a continuous outcome, with a score on a numerical scale) and 3) serious adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were: 4) disease\u2010specific health\u2010related quality of life, 5) generic health\u2010related quality of life and 6) other adverse effects. We considered outcomes reported at three time points: 3 to < 6 months, 6 to \u2264 12 months and > 12 months. We planned to use GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.\u00a0    Main results Few randomised controlled trials have been conducted to assess the efficacy of different treatments for PPPD compared to no treatment (or placebo). Of the few studies we identified, only one followed up participants for at least three months, therefore most were not eligible for inclusion in this review.\u00a0  We identified one study from South Korea that compared the use of transcranial direct current stimulation to a sham procedure in 24 people with PPPD. This is a technique that involves electrical stimulation of the brain with a weak current, through electrodes that are placed onto the scalp. This study provided some information on the occurrence of adverse effects, and also on disease\u2010specific quality of life at three months of follow\u2010up. The other outcomes of interest in this review were not assessed. As this is a single, small study we cannot draw any meaningful conclusions from the numeric results.\u00a0    Authors' conclusions Further work is necessary to determine whether any non\u2010pharmacological interventions may be effective for the treatment of PPPD and to assess whether they are associated with any potential harms. As this is a chronic disease, future trials should follow up participants for a sufficient period of time to assess whether there is a persisting impact on the severity of the disease, rather than only observing short\u2010term effects.",

If cross\u2010over trials were identified then these would have been included, providing the data were reported in an appropriate way to be included in the meta\u2010analysis. If cluster\u2010RCTS were identified then they would also have been eligible for inclusion, providing we could appropriately account for the clustering in the data analysis. We included studies reported as full\u2010text, those published as conference abstracts only and unpublished data. For studies to obtain accurate estimates of effect for different interventions, we considered that follow\u2010up of participants should last at least three months, as the interventions may take some time to take effect, and this is a chronic illness, whereas short\u2010term follow\u2010up may not accurately represent the longer\u2010term outcome for patients. Studies that followed up participants for less than three months were excluded from the review.",
            "Types of participants": "We included studies that recruited adult participants (aged 18 years or older) with a diagnosis of PPPD, according to the B\u00e1r\u00e1ny Society criteria (see\u00a0Appendix 1). We excluded from the review studies that used alternative definitions of functional dizziness syndromes, such as chronic subjective dizziness (CSD), visual vertigo, space\u2010motion discomfort or phobic postural vertigo. Although we recognise that the symptoms of PPPD overlap considerably with some features of these disorders, we focused the results of the review so that they are directly relevant to those who are diagnosed with this (recently characterised) condition. Where studies had recruited participants with a variety of diagnoses (e.g. PPPD and other distinct conditions) we planned to include the study if either: the majority of participants (\u2265 90%) had a diagnosis of PPPD; or   subgroup data were available that allowed us to identify data relevant specifically to those with PPPD. the majority of participants (\u2265 90%) had a diagnosis of PPPD; or subgroup data were available that allowed us to identify data relevant specifically to those with PPPD. However, we did not identify any studies where this was the case.",

We considered these to be non\u2010pharmacological interventions that would be likely to be used for PPPD. However, due to the paucity of data available, we deviated from our protocol and included any non\u2010pharmacological interventions that had been used in a study which met all of our other inclusion criteria. The main comparisons were intended to be: talking therapies or stress management versus no treatment;   vestibular rehabilitation versus no treatment. talking therapies or stress management versus no treatment; vestibular rehabilitation versus no treatment. Due to the inclusion of one study on transcranial direct current stimulation for PPPD, we added an additional comparison: transcranial direct current stimulation versus no treatment/placebo. transcranial direct current stimulation versus no treatment/placebo. There were no limits on the type of concurrent treatments used, providing these were used equally in each arm of the study.",

The exception was for adverse event data, when we used the longest time period of follow\u2010up. We searched the COMET database for existing core outcome sets of relevance to PPPD and vertigo, but were unable to find any published core outcome sets. We therefore conducted a survey of individuals with experience of (or an interest in) balance disorders to help identify outcomes that should be prioritised. This online survey was conducted with the support of the M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's Society and the Migraine Trust, and included 324 participants, who provided information regarding priority outcomes. The review author team used the results of this survey to inform the choice of outcome measures in this review. We planned to analyse the following outcomes in the review, but we did not use them as a basis for including or excluding studies. Improvement in vestibular symptoms   Measured as a dichotomous outcome (improved/not improved), according to self\u2010report, or according to a change of a specified score (as described by the study authors) on a rating scale.      Change in vestibular symptoms   Measured as a continuous outcome, to identify the extent of change in vestibular symptoms.     Serious adverse events   Including any event that caused death, was life\u2010threatening, required hospitalisation, resulted in disability or permanent damage, or in congenital abnormality. Measured as the number of participants who experienced at least one serious adverse event during the follow\u2010up period. Improvement in vestibular symptoms Measured as a dichotomous outcome (improved/not improved), according to self\u2010report, or according to a change of a specified score (as described by the study authors) on a rating scale. Change in vestibular symptoms Measured as a continuous outcome, to identify the extent of change in vestibular symptoms. Serious adverse events Including any event that caused death, was life\u2010threatening, required hospitalisation, resulted in disability or permanent damage, or in congenital abnormality. Measured as the number of participants who experienced at least one serious adverse event during the follow\u2010up period. Vestibular symptoms comprise a variety of different features, including frequency of episodes, duration of episodes and severity/intensity of the episodes. People may experience vertigo, dizziness or unsteadiness as part of this disorder. Where possible, we included data for the vestibular symptoms outcomes that encompassed all aspects (frequency, duration and severity/intensity of symptoms). Disease\u2010specific health\u2010related quality of life   Measured with the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI,\u00a0Jacobsen 1990), a validated measurement scale in widespread use. If data from the DHI were unavailable we planned to extract data from alternative validated measurement scales, according to the order of preference described in the list below (based on the validity of the scales for this outcome):    DHI short form (Tesio 1999);    DHI screening tool (Jacobsen 1998).        Generic health\u2010related quality of life   Measured with a validated measurement tool that assesses global health\u2010related quality of life, such as the EQ\u20105D\u20103L (EuroQol 1990), EQ\u20105D\u20105L (Herdman 2011) or SF\u201036 (Ware 1992).      Other adverse effects   Measured as the number of participants who experience at least one episode of the specified adverse events during the follow\u2010up period.

            "Appendix 1. Diagnostic criteria for PPPD": "The B\u00e1r\u00e1ny Society criteria for PPPD (Staab 2017):     One or more symptoms of dizziness, unsteadiness or non\u2010spinning vertigo, present on most days for three months or more:    symptoms are persistent, but wax and wane;   symptoms tend to increase as the day progresses, but may not be active throughout the entire day;    momentary flares may occur spontaneously or with sudden movements.     Symptoms are present without specific provocation, but are exacerbated by:   upright posture;   active or passive motion without regard to direction or position; and   exposure to moving visual stimuli or complex visual patterns, although these three features may not be equally provocative.      The disorder usually begins shortly after an event that causes acute vestibular symptoms or problems with balance, though less commonly it develops slowly. Precipitating events include acute, episodic or chronic vestibular syndromes, other neurologic or medical illness, and psychological distress:    when triggered by an acute or episodic precipitant, symptoms typically settle into the pattern of criterion 1 as the precipitant resolves, but may occur intermittently at first, and then consolidate into a persistent course;    when triggered by a chronic precipitant, symptoms may develop slowly and worsen gradually.     Symptoms cause significant distress or functional impairment.   Symptoms are not better attributed to another disease or disorder.",

It includes a set of predefined criteria to select studies that, based on available information, are deemed to be sufficiently trustworthy to be included in the analysis. These criteria are:  Research governance     Are there any retraction notices or expressions of concern listed on the Retraction Watch Database relating to this study?    Was the study prospectively registered (for those studies published after 2010)? If not, was there a plausible reason?    When requested, did the trial authors provide/share the protocol and/or ethics approval letter?    Did the trial authors engage in communication with the Cochrane Review authors within the agreed timelines?    Did the trial authors provide IPD data upon request? If not, was there a plausible reason?     Baseline characteristics     Is the study free from characteristics of the study participants that appear too similar (e.g. distribution of the mean (SD) excessively narrow or excessively wide, as noted by\u00a0Carlisle 2017)?     Feasibility     Is the study free from characteristics that could be implausible? (e.g. large numbers of women with a rare condition (such as severe cholestasis in pregnancy) recruited within 12 months);    In cases with (close to) zero losses to follow\u2010up, is there a plausible explanation?    Results     Is the study free from results that could be implausible? (e.g. massive risk reduction for main outcomes with small sample size)?    Do the numbers randomised to each group suggest that adequate randomisation methods were used (e.g. is the study free from issues such as unexpectedly even numbers of women \u2018randomised\u2019 including a mismatch between the numbers and the methods, if the authors say \u2018no blocking was used\u2019 but still end up with equal numbers, or if the authors say they used \u2018blocks of 4\u2019 but the final numbers differ by 6)?     Studies assessed as being potentially \u2018high risk\u2019 will be not be included in the review. Where a study is classified as \u2018high risk\u2019 for one or more of the above criteria we will attempt to contact the study authors to address any possible lack of information/concerns.

If cross\u2010over trials were identified then these would have been included, providing the data were reported in an appropriate way to be included in the meta\u2010analysis. If cluster\u2010RCTS were identified then they would also have been eligible for inclusion, providing we could appropriately account for the clustering in the data analysis. We included studies reported as full\u2010text, those published as conference abstracts only and unpublished data. For studies to obtain accurate estimates of effect for different interventions, we considered that follow\u2010up of participants should last at least three months, as the interventions may take some time to take effect, and this is a chronic illness, whereas short\u2010term follow\u2010up may not accurately represent the longer\u2010term outcome for patients. Studies that followed up participants for less than three months were excluded from the review. We included studies that recruited adult participants (aged 18 years or older) with a diagnosis of PPPD, according to the B\u00e1r\u00e1ny Society criteria (see\u00a0Appendix 1). We excluded from the review studies that used alternative definitions of functional dizziness syndromes, such as chronic subjective dizziness (CSD), visual vertigo, space\u2010motion discomfort or phobic postural vertigo. Although we recognise that the symptoms of PPPD overlap considerably with some features of these disorders, we focused the results of the review so that they are directly relevant to those who are diagnosed with this (recently characterised) condition. Where studies had recruited participants with a variety of diagnoses (e.g. PPPD and other distinct conditions) we planned to include the study if either: the majority of participants (\u2265 90%) had a diagnosis of PPPD; or   subgroup data were available that allowed us to identify data relevant specifically to those with PPPD. the majority of participants (\u2265 90%) had a diagnosis of PPPD; or subgroup data were available that allowed us to identify data relevant specifically to those with PPPD. However, we did not identify any studies where this was the case. We planned to include the following interventions: talking therapies or stress management (including counselling, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), meditation, mindfulness);    vestibular rehabilitation. talking therapies or stress management (including counselling, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), meditation, mindfulness); vestibular rehabilitation. We considered these to be non\u2010pharmacological interventions that would be likely to be used for PPPD. However, due to the paucity of data available, we deviated from our protocol and included any non\u2010pharmacological interventions that had been used in a study which met all of our other inclusion criteria. The main comparisons were intended to be: talking therapies or stress management versus no treatment;   vestibular rehabilitation versus no treatment. talking therapies or stress management versus no treatment; vestibular rehabilitation versus no treatment. Due to the inclusion of one study on transcranial direct current stimulation for PPPD, we added an additional comparison: transcranial direct current stimulation versus no treatment/placebo. transcranial direct current stimulation versus no treatment/placebo. There were no limits on the type of concurrent treatments used, providing these were used equally in each arm of the study. There were no limits on the type of concurrent treatments used, providing these were used equally in each arm of the study.

The exception was for adverse event data, when we used the longest time period of follow\u2010up. We searched the COMET database for existing core outcome sets of relevance to PPPD and vertigo, but were unable to find any published core outcome sets. We therefore conducted a survey of individuals with experience of (or an interest in) balance disorders to help identify outcomes that should be prioritised. This online survey was conducted with the support of the M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's Society and the Migraine Trust, and included 324 participants, who provided information regarding priority outcomes. The review author team used the results of this survey to inform the choice of outcome measures in this review. We planned to analyse the following outcomes in the review, but we did not use them as a basis for including or excluding studies.

        "title": "Treatment of enteric fever (typhoid and paratyphoid fever) with cephalosporins",
        "abstract": "Background Typhoid and paratyphoid (enteric fever) are febrile bacterial illnesses common in many low\u2010 and middle\u2010income countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) currently recommends treatment with azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, or ceftriaxone due to widespread resistance to older, first\u2010line antimicrobials. Resistance patterns vary in different locations and are changing over time. Fluoroquinolone resistance in South Asia often precludes the use of ciprofloxacin. Extensively drug\u2010resistant strains of enteric fever have emerged in Pakistan. In some areas of the world, susceptibility to old first\u2010line antimicrobials, such as chloramphenicol, has re\u2010appeared. A Cochrane Review of the use of fluoroquinolones and azithromycin in the treatment of enteric fever has previously been undertaken, but the use of cephalosporins has not been systematically investigated and the optimal choice of drug and duration of treatment are uncertain.    Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of cephalosporins for treating enteric fever in children and adults compared to other antimicrobials.    Search methods We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, the WHO ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov up to 24 November 2021. We also searched reference lists of included trials, contacted researchers working in the field, and contacted relevant organizations.    Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in adults and children with enteric fever that compared a cephalosporin to another antimicrobial, a different cephalosporin, or a different treatment duration of the intervention cephalosporin.\u00a0Enteric fever was diagnosed on the basis of blood culture, bone marrow culture, or molecular tests.    Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were clinical failure, microbiological failure and relapse. Our secondary outcomes were time to defervescence, duration of hospital admission, convalescent faecal carriage, and adverse effects. We used the GRADE approach to assess certainty of evidence for each outcome.    Main results We included 27 RCTs with 2231 total participants published between 1986 and 2016 across Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East and the Caribbean, with comparisons between cephalosporins and other antimicrobials used for the treatment of enteric fever in children and adults. The main comparisons are between antimicrobials in most common clinical use, namely cephalosporins compared to a fluoroquinolone and cephalosporins compared to azithromycin.  Cephalosporin (cefixime) versus fluoroquinolones  Clinical failure, microbiological failure and relapse may be increased in patients treated with cefixime compared to fluoroquinolones in three small trials published over 14 years ago: clinical failure (risk ratio (RR) 13.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.24 to 55.39; 2 trials, 240 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence); microbiological failure (RR 4.07, 95% CI 0.46 to 36.41; 2 trials, 240 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence); relapse (RR 4.45, 95% CI 1.11 to 17.84; 2 trials, 220 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). Time to defervescence in participants treated with cefixime may be longer compared to participants treated with fluoroquinolones (mean difference (MD) 1.74 days, 95% CI 0.50 to 2.98, 3 trials, 425 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence).  Cephalosporin (ceftriaxone) versus azithromycin  Ceftriaxone may result in a decrease in clinical failure compared to azithromycin, and it is unclear whether ceftriaxone has an effect on microbiological failure compared to azithromycin in two small trials published over 18 years ago and in one more recent trial, all conducted in participants under 18 years of age: clinical failure (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.11 to 1.57; 3 trials, 196 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence); microbiological failure (RR 1.95, 95% CI 0.36 to 10.64, 3 trials, 196 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence). It is unclear whether ceftriaxone increases or decreases relapse compared to azithromycin (RR 10.05, 95% CI 1.93 to 52.38; 3 trials, 185 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence). Time to defervescence in participants treated with ceftriaxone may be shorter compared to participants treated with azithromycin (mean difference of \u22120.52 days, 95% CI \u22120.91 to \u22120.12; 3 trials, 196 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence).  Cephalosporin (ceftriaxone) versus fluoroquinolones  It is unclear whether ceftriaxone has an effect on clinical failure, microbiological failure, relapse, and time to defervescence compared to fluoroquinolones in three trials published over 28 years ago and two more recent trials: clinical failure (RR 3.77, 95% CI 0.72 to 19.81; 4 trials, 359 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence); microbiological failure (RR 1.65, 95% CI 0.40 to 6.83; 3 trials, 316 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence); relapse (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.31 to 2.92; 3 trials, 297 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence) and time to defervescence (MD 2.73 days, 95% CI \u22120.37 to 5.84; 3 trials, 285 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence). It is unclear whether ceftriaxone decreases convalescent faecal carriage compared to the fluoroquinolone gatifloxacin (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.01 to 3.72; 1 trial, 73 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence) and length of hospital stay may be longer in participants treated with ceftriaxone compared to participants treated with the fluoroquinolone ofloxacin (mean of 12 days (range 7 to 23 days) in the ceftriaxone group compared to a mean of 9 days (range 6 to 13 days) in the ofloxacin group; 1 trial, 47 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence).    Authors' conclusions Based on very low\u2010 to low\u2010certainty evidence, ceftriaxone is an effective treatment for adults and children with enteric fever, with few adverse effects. Trials suggest that there may be no difference in the performance of ceftriaxone compared with azithromycin, fluoroquinolones, or chloramphenicol. Cefixime can also be used for treatment of enteric fever but may not perform as well as fluoroquinolones.\u00a0  We are unable to draw firm general conclusions on comparative contemporary effectiveness given that most trials were small and conducted over 20 years previously. Clinicians need to take into account current, local resistance patterns in addition to route of administration when choosing an antimicrobial.",

        "title": "Drugs to reduce bleeding and transfusion in major open vascular or endovascular surgery: a systematic review and network meta\u2010analysis",
        "abstract": "Background Vascular surgery may be followed by internal bleeding due to inadequate surgical haemostasis, abnormal clotting, or surgical complications. Bleeding ranges from minor, with no transfusion requirement, to massive, requiring multiple blood product transfusions. There are a number of drugs, given systemically or applied locally, which may reduce the need for blood transfusion.    Objectives To assess the effectiveness and safety of anti\u2010fibrinolytic and haemostatic drugs and agents in reducing bleeding and the need for blood transfusion in people undergoing major vascular surgery or vascular procedures with a risk of moderate or severe (> 500 mL) blood loss.    Search methods We searched: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; MEDLINE; Embase; CINAHL, and Transfusion Evidence Library. We also searched the WHO ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov trial registries for ongoing and unpublished trials. Searches used a combination of MeSH and free text terms from database inception to 31 March 2022, without restriction on language or publication status.    Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in adults of drug treatments to reduce bleeding due to major vascular surgery or vascular procedures with a risk of moderate or severe blood loss, which used placebo, usual care or another drug regimen as control.    Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were units of red cells transfused and all\u2010cause mortality. Our secondary outcomes included risk of receiving an allogeneic blood product, risk of reoperation or repeat procedure due to bleeding, risk of a thromboembolic event, risk of a serious adverse event and length of hospital stay. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence.    Main results We included 22 RCTs with 3393 participants analysed, of which one RCT with 69 participants was reported only in abstract form, with no usable data. Seven RCTs evaluated systemic drug treatments (three aprotinin, two desmopressin, two tranexamic acid) and 15 RCTs evaluated topical drug treatments (drug\u2010containing bioabsorbable dressings or glues), including fibrin, thrombin, collagen, gelatin, synthetic sealants and one investigational new agent. Most trials were conducted in high\u2010income countries and the majority of the trials only included participants undergoing elective surgery. We also identified two ongoing RCTs.  We were unable to perform the planned network meta\u2010analysis due to the sparse reporting of outcomes relevant to this review.  Systemic drug treatments  We identified seven trials of three systemic drugs: aprotinin, desmopressin and tranexamic acid, all with placebo controls. The trials of aprotinin and desmopressin were small with very low\u2010certainty evidence for all of our outcomes. Tranexamic acid versus placebo was the systemic drug comparison with the largest number of participants (2 trials; 1460 participants), both at low risk of bias. The largest of these included a total of 9535 individuals undergoing a number of different higher risk surgeries and reported limited information on the vascular subgroup (1399 participants).  Neither trial reported the number of units of red cells transfused per participant up to 30 days. Three outcomes were associated with very low\u2010certainty evidence due to the very wide confidence intervals (CIs) resulting from small study sizes and low number of events. These were: all\u2010cause mortality up to 30 days; number of participants requiring an allogeneic blood transfusion up to 30 days; and risk of requiring a repeat procedure or operation due to bleeding.  Tranexamic acid may have no effect on the risk of thromboembolic events up to 30 days (risk ratio (RR) 1.10, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.36; 1 trial, 1360 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence due to imprecision).  There is one large ongoing trial (8320 participants) comparing tranexamic acid versus placebo in people undergoing non\u2010cardiac surgery who are at high risk of requiring a red cell transfusion. This aims to complete recruitment in April 2023. This trial has primary outcomes of proportion of participants transfused with red blood cells and incidence of venous thromboembolism (DVT or PE).  Topical drug treatments  Most trials of topical drug treatments were at high risk of bias due to their open\u2010label design (compared with usual care, or liquids were compared with sponges). All of the trials were small, most were very small, and few reported clinically relevant outcomes in the postoperative period. Fibrin sealant versus usual care was the topical drug comparison with the largest number of participants (5 trials, 784 participants).  The five trials that compared fibrin sealant with usual care were all at high risk of bias, due to the open\u2010label trial design with no measures put in place to minimise reporting bias. All of the trials were funded by pharmaceutical companies.  None of the five trials reported the number of red cells transfused per participant up to 30 days or the number of participants requiring an allogeneic blood transfusion up to 30 days.  The other three outcomes were associated with very low\u2010certainty evidence with wide confidence intervals due to small sample sizes and the low number of events, these were: all\u2010cause mortality up to 30 days; risk of requiring a repeat procedure due to bleeding; and risk of thromboembolic disease up to 30 days.  We identified one large trial (500 participants) comparing fibrin sealant versus usual care in participants undergoing abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, which has not yet started recruitment. This trial lists death due to arterial disease and reintervention rates as primary outcomes.    Authors' conclusions Because of a lack of data, we are uncertain whether any systemic or topical treatments used to reduce bleeding due to major vascular surgery have an effect on: all\u2010cause mortality up to 30 days; risk of requiring a repeat procedure or operation due to bleeding; number of red cells transfused per participant up to 30 days or the number of participants requiring an allogeneic blood transfusion up to 30 days.  There may be no effect of tranexamic acid on the risk of thromboembolic events up to 30 days, this is important as there has been concern that this risk may be increased.  Trials with sample size targets of thousands of participants and clinically relevant outcomes are needed, and we look forward to seeing the results of the ongoing trials in the future.",

Endovascular stenting for peripheral arterial disease of the: aortic artery; iliac artery; femoral artery; or popliteal artery We included participants undergoing surgery with or without aortic cross clamping and with or without use of hypothermia. We included participants undergoing open, modifications of open, and minimally invasive, e.g. laparoscopic, surgical approaches. We excluded procedures typically performed by or in conjunction with cardiac surgeons, such as those on the ascending aorta and aortic root, or those using coronary artery bypass grafting. These are the topic of a separate ongoing Cochrane Review entitled Drugs to reduce bleeding and transfusion in adults undergoing cardiac surgery; a systematic review and network meta\u2010analysis (Beverly 2019). We excluded studies involving elective endovascular procedures. We excluded procedures associated with minimal bleeding and transfusion, such as carotid procedures, arterio\u2010venous fistulae formation for dialysis, varicose vein surgery and upper limb or digit amputations. We also excluded procedures typically performed by neurosurgeons, such as repair of aneurysms or dissection of arteries in the head or neck. We excluded people with known inherited coagulation disorders, such as von Willebrand factor deficiency, haemophilia or hypofibrinogenaemia. This is because the clotting mechanisms that the drugs promote or interact with may be genetically absent, making response atypical. For trials consisting of mixed populations of participants (e.g. including children, or including procedures other than those specified), we only used data from participants 18 years or over undergoing the specified procedures, without clotting disorders. If the subgroup data required were not provided, we excluded the trial if less than 80% of participants were eligible to be included.",

We did not exclude trials on the basis of the route, dose, timing, or frequency of drug administration. The comparison groups were as defined by the study, which could be a control group using placebo, standard care, or one of the included drugs, if a second additional drug was being investigated.",
            "Types of outcome measures": "We were primarily interested in postsurgical outcomes, and especially the need for blood transfusion. We did not include intraoperative outcomes, such as time to haemostasis, because these outcomes are prone to measurement bias and are of limited clinical relevance or interest to health services.

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster\u2010RCTs if the analyses accounted for clustering, or if we were able to adequately adjust for clustering (McKenzie 2016). We included all studies regardless of their language or publication status. We excluded studies with purely experimental laboratory outcomes (for example blood tests for inflammatory markers). We included adults (18 years or over) undergoing the following emergency, urgent and elective procedures. Open surgical repair (OSR) of aneurysm of the:   abdominal aorta (AAA);   thoracic aorta (TAA);   thoraco\u2010abdominal aorta (TAAA);   iliac artery;   femoral artery; or   popliteal artery.

Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) of the:   abdominal aorta (AAA);   thoracic aorta (TAA);   thoraco\u2010abdominal aorta (TAAA);   iliac artery;   femoral artery; or   popliteal artery.

Endovascular stenting for peripheral arterial disease of the: aortic artery; iliac artery; femoral artery; or popliteal artery We included participants undergoing surgery with or without aortic cross clamping and with or without use of hypothermia. We included participants undergoing open, modifications of open, and minimally invasive, e.g. laparoscopic, surgical approaches. We excluded procedures typically performed by or in conjunction with cardiac surgeons, such as those on the ascending aorta and aortic root, or those using coronary artery bypass grafting. These are the topic of a separate ongoing Cochrane Review entitled Drugs to reduce bleeding and transfusion in adults undergoing cardiac surgery; a systematic review and network meta\u2010analysis (Beverly 2019). We excluded studies involving elective endovascular procedures. We excluded procedures associated with minimal bleeding and transfusion, such as carotid procedures, arterio\u2010venous fistulae formation for dialysis, varicose vein surgery and upper limb or digit amputations. We also excluded procedures typically performed by neurosurgeons, such as repair of aneurysms or dissection of arteries in the head or neck. We excluded people with known inherited coagulation disorders, such as von Willebrand factor deficiency, haemophilia or hypofibrinogenaemia. This is because the clotting mechanisms that the drugs promote or interact with may be genetically absent, making response atypical. For trials consisting of mixed populations of participants (e.g. including children, or including procedures other than those specified), we only used data from participants 18 years or over undergoing the specified procedures, without clotting disorders. If the subgroup data required were not provided, we excluded the trial if less than 80% of participants were eligible to be included. We included RCTs of the following interventions, compared to usual care, placebo, or each other. Tranexamic acid (TXA)   \u03b5\u2010aminocaproic acid (EACA)   Aprotinin   Desmopressin   Prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC)   Recombinant factor VII (rFVII)   Factor XIII (FXIII)   Fibrinogen concentrate   Other topical agents, categorised as:   fibrin\u2010based agents;   thrombin\u2010based agents;   synthetic sealants;   passive biomaterials; and   combination agents. Tranexamic acid (TXA) \u03b5\u2010aminocaproic acid (EACA) Aprotinin Desmopressin Prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) Recombinant factor VII (rFVII) Factor XIII (FXIII) Fibrinogen concentrate Other topical agents, categorised as: fibrin\u2010based agents; thrombin\u2010based agents; synthetic sealants; passive biomaterials; and combination agents. We included RCTs that compared one or more of the interventions listed above. We included studies using a combination of the above drugs. We did not exclude trials on the basis of the route, dose, timing, or frequency of drug administration. The comparison groups were as defined by the study, which could be a control group using placebo, standard care, or one of the included drugs, if a second additional drug was being investigated. We were primarily interested in postsurgical outcomes, and especially the need for blood transfusion. We did not include intraoperative outcomes, such as time to haemostasis, because these outcomes are prone to measurement bias and are of limited clinical relevance or interest to health services. Our primary outcomes were: Red cell transfusions (units per participant*) at up to 30 days post surgery   All\u2010cause mortality at up to 30 days; and between 31 and 90 days Red cell transfusions (units per participant*) at up to 30 days post surgery All\u2010cause mortality at up to 30 days; and between 31 and 90 days *If the red cell transfusion outcome was reported in mL, we converted that into units, according to any local mean unit volume data given in the study, or as per the Guidelines for the Blood Transfusion Services in the UK mean stated volume per unit of red cells of 280 \u00b1 60 mLs (JPAC 2013). Our secondary outcomes were as follows. Risk of receiving any allogeneic blood product at up to 30 days post surgery   Composite: packed red cells (PRC), fresh frozen plasma (FFP), platelets (PLTs)   Components: PRC, FFP, PLTs     Risk of reoperation or repeat procedure for bleeding within 7 days   Risk of a thrombotic/thromboembolic event   Composite: myocardial Infarction (MI), cerebrovascular attack (CVA), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolus (PE) at up to 30 days and between 31 and 90 days    Components: MI at up to 30 days, CVA at up to 30 days, DVT at up to 90 days, PE at up to 90 days      Risk of a serious adverse event (SAE) at up to 30 days postsurgery   Length of hospital stay (days) Risk of receiving any allogeneic blood product at up to 30 days post surgery Composite: packed red cells (PRC), fresh frozen plasma (FFP), platelets (PLTs) Components: PRC, FFP, PLTs Risk of reoperation or repeat procedure for bleeding within 7 days Risk of a thrombotic/thromboembolic event Composite: myocardial Infarction (MI), cerebrovascular attack (CVA), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolus (PE) at up to 30 days and between 31 and 90 days Components: MI at up to 30 days, CVA at up to 30 days, DVT at up to 90 days, PE at up to 90 days Risk of a serious adverse event (SAE) at up to 30 days postsurgery Length of hospital stay (days) We commented on any cost data, if presented, in a narrative form (Ryan 2016).

        "title": "Interventions to improve water, sanitation, and hygiene for preventing soil\u2010transmitted helminth infection",
        "abstract": "Background It is estimated that 1.5 billion people are infected with soil\u2010transmitted helminths (STHs) worldwide. Re\u2010infection occurs rapidly following deworming, and interruption of transmission is unlikely without complementary control efforts such as improvements in water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) access and behaviours.    Objectives To assess the effectiveness of WASH interventions to prevent STH infection.   Search methods We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 19 October 2021.    Selection criteria We included interventions to improve WASH access or practices in communities where STHs are endemic. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), as well as trials with an external control group where participants (or clusters) were allocated to different interventions using a non\u2010random method (non\u2010RCTs).\u00a0We did not include observational study designs.\u00a0Our primary outcome was prevalence of any STH infection. Prevalence of individual worms was a secondary outcome, including for Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, hookworm (Ancylostoma duodenale or Necator americanus), or Strongyloides stercoralis. Intensity of infection, measured as a count of eggs per gram of faeces for each species, was another secondary outcome.    Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently reviewed titles and abstracts and full\u2010text records for eligibility, performed data extraction, and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool for RCTs and the EPOC tool for non\u2010RCTs. We used a random\u2010effects meta\u2010analysis to pool study estimates. We used Moran\u2019s I\u00b2 statistic to assess heterogeneity and conducted subgroup analyses to explore sources of heterogeneity. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.    Main results We included 32 studies (16 RCTs and 16 non\u2010RCTs) involving a total of 52,944 participants in the review. Twenty\u2010two studies (14 RCTs (16 estimates) and eight non\u2010RCTs (11 estimates)) reported on our primary outcome, prevalence of infection with at least one STH species. Twenty\u2010one studies reported on the prevalence of A lumbricoides (12 RCTs and 9 non\u2010RCTs); 17 on the prevalence of T trichiura (9 RCTs and 8 non\u2010RCTs); 18 on the prevalence of hookworm (10 RCTs and 8 non\u2010RCTs); and one on the prevalence of S stercoralis (1 non\u2010RCT). Sixteen studies measured the intensity of infection for an individual STH type. Ten RCTs and five non\u2010RCTs reported on the intensity of infection of A lumbricoides; eight RCTs and five non\u2010RCTs measured the intensity of infection of T trichiura; and eight RCTs and five non\u2010RCTs measured the intensity of hookworm infection. No studies reported on the intensity of infection of S stercoralis.  The overall pooled effect estimates showed that the WASH interventions under study may result in a slight reduction of any STH infection, with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.86 amongst RCTs (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74 to 1.01; moderate\u2010certainty evidence) and an OR of 0.71 amongst non\u2010RCTs (95% CI 0.54 to 0.94; low\u2010certainty evidence). All six of the meta\u2010analyses assessing individual worm infection amongst both RCTs and non\u2010RCTs had pooled estimates in the preventive direction, although all CIs encapsulated the null, leaving the possibility of the null or even harmful effects; the certainty of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. Individual studies assessing intensity of infection showed mixed evidence supporting WASH. Subgroup analyses focusing on narrow specific subsets of water, sanitation, and hygiene interventions did very little to elucidate which interventions might be better than others. Data on intensity of infection (e.g. faecal egg count) were reported in a variety of ways across studies, precluding the pooling of results for this outcome.  We did not find any studies reporting adverse events resulting from the WASH interventions under study or from mass drug administration (MDA).    Authors' conclusions Whilst the available evidence suggests that the WASH interventions under study may slightly protect against STH infection, WASH also serves as a broad preventive measure for many other diseases that have a faecal oral transmission route of transmission. As many of the studies were done in addition to MDA/deworming (i.e. MDA was ongoing in both the intervention and control arm), our data support WHO recommendations for implementation of improvements to basic sanitation and adequate access to safe water alongside MDA. The biological plausibility for improved access to WASH to interrupt transmission of STHs is clear, but WASH interventions as currently delivered have shown impacts that were lower than expected. There is a need for more rigorous and targeted implementation research and process evaluations in order that future WASH interventions can better provide benefit to users. Inconsistent reporting of the intensity of infection underscores the need to define the minimal, standard data that should be collected globally on STHs to enable pooled analyses and comparisons.",

        "title": "Non\u2010pharmacological interventions for prophylaxis of vestibular migraine",
        "abstract": "Background Vestibular migraine is a form of migraine where one of the main features is recurrent attacks of vertigo. These episodes are often associated with other features of migraine, including headache and sensitivity to light or sound. These unpredictable and severe attacks of vertigo can lead to a considerable reduction in quality of life. The condition is estimated to affect just under 1% of the population, although many people remain undiagnosed. A number of interventions have been used, or proposed to be used, as prophylaxis for this condition, to help reduce the frequency of the attacks. Many of these interventions include dietary, lifestyle or behavioural changes, rather than medication.\u00a0    Objectives To assess the benefits and harms of non\u2010pharmacological treatments used for prophylaxis of vestibular migraine.    Search methods The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 23 September 2022.    Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi\u2010RCTs in adults with definite or probable vestibular migraine comparing dietary modifications, sleep improvement techniques, vitamin and mineral supplements, herbal supplements, talking therapies, mind\u2010body interventions or vestibular rehabilitation with either placebo or no treatment. We excluded studies with a cross\u2010over design, unless data from the first phase of the study could be identified.\u00a0    Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were: 1) improvement in vertigo (assessed as a dichotomous outcome \u2010 improved or not improved), 2) change in vertigo (assessed as a continuous outcome, with a score on a numerical scale) and 3) serious adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were: 4) disease\u2010specific health\u2010related quality of life, 5) improvement in headache, 6) improvement in other migrainous symptoms and 7) other adverse effects. We considered outcomes reported at three time points: < 3 months, 3 to < 6 months, > 6 to 12 months. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.\u00a0    Main results We included three studies in this review with a total of 319 participants. Each study addressed a different comparison and these are outlined below. We did not identify any evidence for the remaining comparisons of interest in this review. \u00a0  Dietary interventions (probiotics) versus placebo   We identified one study with 218 participants (85% female). The use of a probiotic supplement was compared to a placebo and participants were followed up for two years. Some data were reported on the change in vertigo frequency and severity over the duration of the study. However, there were no data regarding improvement of vertigo or serious adverse events.  Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) versus no intervention   One study compared CBT to no treatment in 61 participants (72% female). Participants were followed up for eight weeks. Data were reported on the change in vertigo over the course of the study, but no information was reported on the proportion of people whose vertigo improved, or on the occurrence of serious adverse events.\u00a0  Vestibular rehabilitation versus no intervention   The third study compared the use of vestibular rehabilitation to no treatment in a group of 40 participants (90% female) and participants were followed up for six months. Again, this study reported some data on change in the frequency of vertigo during the study, but no information on the proportion of participants who experienced an improvement in vertigo or the number who experienced serious adverse events.\u00a0  We are unable to draw meaningful conclusions from the numerical results of these studies, as the data for each comparison of interest come from single, small studies and the certainty of the evidence was low or very low.\u00a0    Authors' conclusions There is a paucity of evidence for non\u2010pharmacological interventions that may be used for prophylaxis of vestibular migraine. Only a limited number of interventions have been assessed by comparing them to no intervention or a placebo treatment, and the evidence from these studies is all of low or very low certainty. We are therefore unsure whether any of these interventions may be effective at reducing the symptoms of vestibular migraine and we are also unsure whether they have the potential to cause harm.",

The number of episodes of vestibular migraine may vary with time \u2010 patients sometimes have periods of more active disease, followed by a period of fewer attacks. Therefore cross\u2010over trials are not an appropriate study design when assessing prophylaxis for this condition. Cross\u2010over RCTs would only have been included if data could be extracted for the first phase of the study. If cluster\u2010RCTs were identified then they would have been eligible for inclusion, providing we could appropriately account for the clustering in the data analysis (according to methods described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions)\u00a0(Handbook 2021). However, we did not identify any cross\u2010over or cluster\u2010randomised trials for this review.",
            "Types of participants": "We included studies that recruited participants with a diagnosis of vestibular migraine, according to the International Headache Society (IHS) and B\u00e1r\u00e1ny Society criteria (see\u00a0Appendix 1). We also included studies that used other, established criteria, for example\u00a0Neuhauser 2001\u00a0(Appendix 2). We included studies where participants were diagnosed with either 'definite' vestibular migraine or 'probable' vestibular migraine. Where studies recruited participants with a variety of diagnoses (e.g. vestibular migraine and classical migraine) we planned to include the study if either the majority of participants (\u2265 90%) had a diagnosis of vestibular migraine; or   subgroup data were available that allowed us to identify data specifically from those with vestibular migraine. the majority of participants (\u2265 90%) had a diagnosis of vestibular migraine; or subgroup data were available that allowed us to identify data specifically from those with vestibular migraine.

We excluded interventions from alternative medical systems (e.g. Ayurvedic medicines or traditional Chinese medicines) and energy therapies (e.g. acupuncture, acupressure and magnetic therapy). We used the system developed by Wieland et al to classify complementary and alternative medicines and identify whether they will be included/excluded from the review (Wieland 2011). The main comparisons were planned to be: dietary modification versus no intervention/placebo;   sleep improvement techniques versus no intervention/placebo;   vitamin and mineral supplements versus no intervention/placebo;   herbal supplements versus no intervention/placebo;   talking therapies versus no intervention/placebo;   mind\u2010body interventions versus no intervention/placebo;   vestibular rehabilitation versus no intervention/placebo. dietary modification versus no intervention/placebo; sleep improvement techniques versus no intervention/placebo; vitamin and mineral supplements versus no intervention/placebo; herbal supplements versus no intervention/placebo; talking therapies versus no intervention/placebo; mind\u2010body interventions versus no intervention/placebo; vestibular rehabilitation versus no intervention/placebo. There were no limits on the type of concurrent treatments used, providing these were used equally in each arm of the study. We planned to pool studies that included concurrent treatments with those where participants did not receive concurrent treatment, and to conduct subgroup analysis to determine whether the effect estimates may be different in those receiving additional treatment.",

The exception was for adverse event data, when we used the longest time period of follow\u2010up. We searched the COMET database for existing core outcome sets of relevance to vestibular migraine and vertigo, but were unable to find any published core outcome sets. We therefore conducted a survey of individuals with experience of (or an interest in) balance disorders to help identify outcomes that should be prioritised. The results of this survey were used by the review author team to inform the choice of outcome measures in this review. We analysed the following outcomes in the review, but we did not use them as a basis for including or excluding studies. Improvement in vertigo   Measured as a dichotomous outcome (improved/not improved), according to self\u2010report, or according to a change of a specified score (as described by the study authors) on a vertigo rating scale.

Vertigo symptoms comprise a variety of different features, including frequency of episodes, duration of episodes and severity/intensity of the episodes. Where possible, we included data for the vertigo outcomes that encompass all of these three aspects (frequency, duration and severity/intensity of symptoms).

It includes a set of predefined criteria to select studies that, based on available information, are deemed to be sufficiently trustworthy to be included in the analysis. These criteria are:  Research governance     Are there any retraction notices or expressions of concern listed on the Retraction Watch Database relating to this study?    Was the study prospectively registered (for those studies published after 2010)? If not, was there a plausible reason?    When requested, did the trial authors provide/share the protocol and/or ethics approval letter?    Did the trial authors engage in communication with the Cochrane Review authors within the agreed timelines?    Did the trial authors provide IPD data upon request? If not, was there a plausible reason?     Baseline characteristics     Is the study free from characteristics of the study participants that appear too similar (e.g. distribution of the mean (SD) excessively narrow or excessively wide, as noted by\u00a0Carlisle 2017)?     Feasibility     Is the study free from characteristics that could be implausible? (e.g. large numbers of women with a rare condition (such as severe cholestasis in pregnancy) recruited within 12 months);    In cases with (close to) zero losses to follow\u2010up, is there a plausible explanation?    Results     Is the study free from results that could be implausible? (e.g. massive risk reduction for main outcomes with small sample size)?    Do the numbers randomised to each group suggest that adequate randomisation methods were used (e.g. is the study free from issues such as unexpectedly even numbers of women \u2018randomised\u2019 including a mismatch between the numbers and the methods, if the authors say \u2018no blocking was used\u2019 but still end up with equal numbers, or if the authors say they used \u2018blocks of 4\u2019 but the final numbers differ by 6)?     Studies assessed as being potentially \u2018high risk\u2019 will be not be included in the review. Where a study is classified as \u2018high risk\u2019 for one or more of the above criteria we will attempt to contact the study authors to address any possible lack of information/concerns. If adequate information remains unavailable, the study will remain in \u2018awaiting classification\u2019 and the reasons and communications with the author (or lack of) described in detail.

The number of episodes of vestibular migraine may vary with time \u2010 patients sometimes have periods of more active disease, followed by a period of fewer attacks. Therefore cross\u2010over trials are not an appropriate study design when assessing prophylaxis for this condition. Cross\u2010over RCTs would only have been included if data could be extracted for the first phase of the study. If cluster\u2010RCTs were identified then they would have been eligible for inclusion, providing we could appropriately account for the clustering in the data analysis (according to methods described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions)\u00a0(Handbook 2021). However, we did not identify any cross\u2010over or cluster\u2010randomised trials for this review. We included studies that recruited participants with a diagnosis of vestibular migraine, according to the International Headache Society (IHS) and B\u00e1r\u00e1ny Society criteria (see\u00a0Appendix 1). We also included studies that used other, established criteria, for example\u00a0Neuhauser 2001\u00a0(Appendix 2). We included studies where participants were diagnosed with either 'definite' vestibular migraine or 'probable' vestibular migraine. Where studies recruited participants with a variety of diagnoses (e.g. vestibular migraine and classical migraine) we planned to include the study if either the majority of participants (\u2265 90%) had a diagnosis of vestibular migraine; or   subgroup data were available that allowed us to identify data specifically from those with vestibular migraine. the majority of participants (\u2265 90%) had a diagnosis of vestibular migraine; or subgroup data were available that allowed us to identify data specifically from those with vestibular migraine. However, we did not identify any trials that included participants with classical migraine.

We excluded interventions from alternative medical systems (e.g. Ayurvedic medicines or traditional Chinese medicines) and energy therapies (e.g. acupuncture, acupressure and magnetic therapy). We used the system developed by Wieland et al to classify complementary and alternative medicines and identify whether they will be included/excluded from the review (Wieland 2011). The main comparisons were planned to be: dietary modification versus no intervention/placebo;   sleep improvement techniques versus no intervention/placebo;   vitamin and mineral supplements versus no intervention/placebo;   herbal supplements versus no intervention/placebo;   talking therapies versus no intervention/placebo;   mind\u2010body interventions versus no intervention/placebo;   vestibular rehabilitation versus no intervention/placebo. dietary modification versus no intervention/placebo; sleep improvement techniques versus no intervention/placebo; vitamin and mineral supplements versus no intervention/placebo; herbal supplements versus no intervention/placebo; talking therapies versus no intervention/placebo; mind\u2010body interventions versus no intervention/placebo; vestibular rehabilitation versus no intervention/placebo. There were no limits on the type of concurrent treatments used, providing these were used equally in each arm of the study.

We planned to pool studies that included concurrent treatments with those where participants did not receive concurrent treatment, and to conduct subgroup analysis to determine whether the effect estimates may be different in those receiving additional treatment. We assessed outcomes at the following time points: < 3 months;   3 to 6 months;   > 6 to 12 months. < 3 months; 3 to 6 months; > 6 to 12 months. The exception was for adverse event data, when we used the longest time period of follow\u2010up. We searched the COMET database for existing core outcome sets of relevance to vestibular migraine and vertigo, but were unable to find any published core outcome sets. We therefore conducted a survey of individuals with experience of (or an interest in) balance disorders to help identify outcomes that should be prioritised. The results of this survey were used by the review author team to inform the choice of outcome measures in this review. We analysed the following outcomes in the review, but we did not use them as a basis for including or excluding studies. Improvement in vertigo   Measured as a dichotomous outcome (improved/not improved), according to self\u2010report, or according to a change of a specified score (as described by the study authors) on a vertigo rating scale.      Change in vertigo   Measured as a continuous outcome, to identify the extent of change in vertigo symptoms.

        "abstract": "Background Inspiratory muscle training (IMT)\u00a0aims to improve respiratory muscle strength and endurance.\u00a0Clinical trials used various training protocols,\u00a0devices and respiratory measurements to check the effectiveness of this intervention. The current guidelines reported a possible advantage of IMT, particularly in people with respiratory muscle weakness. However, it remains unclear to what extent IMT\u00a0is clinically beneficial, especially when associated with pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). \u00a0    Objectives To assess the effect of inspiratory muscle training (IMT) on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), as a stand\u2010alone intervention and when combined with pulmonary rehabilitation (PR).    Search methods We searched the Cochrane Airways trials register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) EBSCO, Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform on 20 October 2022.\u00a0We also checked reference lists of all primary studies and review articles.    Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared IMT in combination with PR versus PR alone and IMT versus control/sham.\u00a0We included different types of IMT irrespective of the mode of delivery.\u00a0We\u00a0excluded\u00a0trials that used\u00a0resistive devices without controlling the breathing pattern or a training load of less than 30% of maximal inspiratory pressure (PImax), or both.    Data collection and analysis We used standard methods recommended by Cochrane including assessment of risk of bias with RoB 2. Our primary outcomes were dyspnea, functional exercise capacity and health\u2010related quality of life.\u00a0    Main results We included 55 RCTs in this review. Both IMT and PR protocols varied significantly across the trials, especially in training duration, loads, devices, number/ frequency of sessions and the PR programs. Only eight trials were at low risk of bias.  PR+IMT versus PR  We included 22 trials (1446 participants) in this comparison. Based on a minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of \u22121 unit, we did not find an improvement in dyspnea assessed with the\u00a0Borg scale\u00a0at submaximal exercise capacity (mean difference (MD) 0.19, 95% confidence interval (CI) \u22120.42 to 0.79; 2 RCTs, 202 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). \u00a0  We also found no improvement in dyspnea assessed with themodified Medical Research Council dyspnea scale (mMRC) according to an MCID between \u22120.5 and \u22121 unit (MD \u22120.12, 95% CI \u22120.39 to 0.14; 2 RCTs, 204 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence).\u00a0  Pooling evidence for the\u00a06\u2010minute walk distance (6MWD)\u00a0showed\u00a0an increase of 5.95 meters\u00a0(95% CI \u22125.73\u00a0to 17.63; 12 RCTs, 1199 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence) and failed to reach the\u00a0MCID of 26 meters. In subgroup analysis, we divided the RCTs according to the training duration and mean baseline PImax. The test for subgroup differences was not significant. Trials at low risk of bias (n = 3) demonstrated a larger effect estimate than the overall.  The summary effect of the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) revealed an overall\u00a0total score below the MCID of 4 units (MD 0.13, 95% CI \u22120.93 to 1.20; 7 RCTs, 908 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence).\u00a0  The summary effect of COPD Assessment Test (CAT) did not show an improvement in the HRQoL (MD 0.13, 95% CI \u22120.80 to 1.06; 2 RCTs, 657 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence), according to an MCID of \u22121.6 units.\u00a0  Pooling the RCTs that reported PImax showed an increase of 11.46 cmH2O (95% CI 7.42 to 15.50; 17 RCTs, 1329 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence) but failed to reach the MCID of 17.2 cmH2O. \u00a0In subgroup analysis, we did not find a difference between different training durations and between studies judged with and without respiratory muscle weakness.\u00a0  One abstract reported some adverse effects that were considered \"minor and self\u2010limited\".  IMT versus control/sham  Thirty\u2010seven\u00a0RCTs with 1021 participants contributed to our second comparison. There was a trend towards an improvement when Borg was calculated\u00a0at submaximal exercise capacity\u00a0(MD \u22120.94, 95% CI \u22121.36 to \u22120.51; 6 RCTs, 144 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence). Only one trial was at a low risk of bias.  Eight studies (nine arms) used the Baseline Dyspnea Index \u2010 Transition Dyspnea Index (BDI\u2010TDI).\u00a0Based on an MCID of +1 unit, they\u00a0showed an improvement only with the 'total score' of the TDI (MD 2.98, 95% CI 2.07 to 3.89; 8 RCTs, 238 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence). We\u00a0did not find a difference between studies classified as with and without respiratory muscle weakness. Only one trial was at low risk of bias.  Four studies reported the mMRC, revealing a possible\u00a0improvement in dyspnea\u00a0in the IMT group\u00a0(MD \u22120.59, 95% CI \u22120.76 to \u22120.43; 4 RCTs, 150 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). Two trials were at low risk of bias.  Compared to control/sham, the MD in the 6MWD following IMT was 35.71 (95% CI 25.68\u00a0to 45.74; 16 RCTs, 501 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). Two studies were at low risk of bias. In subgroup analysis, we did not find a difference between different training durations and between studies judged with and without respiratory muscle weakness.\u00a0  Six studies reported theSGRQ total score, showing a larger effect in the IMT\u00a0group\u00a0(MD \u22123.85, 95% CI \u22128.18 to 0.48; 6 RCTs, 182 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence). The lower limit of the 95% CI exceeded the MCID of \u22124 units. Only one study was at low risk of bias.  There was an improvement in life quality with CAT (MD \u22122.97, 95% CI \u22123.85 to \u22122.10; 2 RCTs, 86 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). One trial was at low risk of bias.  Thirty\u2010two RCTs reported PImax, showing an improvement without reaching the MCID (MD 14.57 cmH2O, 95% CI 9.85 to 19.29; 32 RCTs, 916 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). In subgroup analysis, we did not find a difference between different training durations and between studies judged with and without respiratory muscle weakness. \u00a0  None of the included RCTs reported adverse events.    Authors' conclusions IMT may not\u00a0improve dyspnea, functional exercise capacity and life quality when associated with PR. However, IMT is likely to improve these outcomes when provided alone.  For both interventions, a larger effect in participants with respiratory muscle weakness and with longer training durations is still to be confirmed.",

We planned to include\u00a0RCTs with different conditions for the same intervention of interest as long as we could obtain the data of participants with COPD separately.

            "Types of interventions": "The review\u00a0consists of two comparisons, as follows. IMT plus PR versus PR   IMT versus no treatment or sham IMT plus PR versus PR IMT versus no treatment or sham First, we\u00a0included trials that explored the benefit of combining IMT and PR compared to PR only. PR consists of, but is not limited to, exercise training, physiotherapy, therapeutic education, and nutritional and psychosocial care (McCarthy 2015). We included different types of IMT irrespective of the mode of delivery: resistance training (high load, low frequency) or endurance training (low load, high frequency), device (i.e. threshold loading, resistive flow device, isocapnic hyperpnea). We made\u00a0no restrictions on the duration, supervision (home\u2010based or in a healthcare setting), or timing (during hospitalization or later) of the intervention. We\u00a0excluded studies where the training was conducted only once\u00a0per week (face\u2010to\u2010face or distance sessions), regardless of the total duration of the clinical trial. The minimum accepted training load\u00a0was\u00a030% of PImax or more\u00a0(Hill 2010). We also excluded trials that used a resistive device without controlling the breathing pattern. If a study conducted an incremental\u00a0training load that started\u00a0less than 30% of PImax, we\u00a0considered only the follow\u2010up\u00a0from which the load was equal to our threshold. According to the proportion of supervised sessions, we defined supervision as: under 20%: unsupervised;\u00a0\u00a0   20% to 70%: partially supervised; and\u00a0\u00a0   above 70%: fully supervised. under 20%: unsupervised; 20% to 70%: partially supervised; and above 70%: fully supervised. For the second comparison, we compared IMT with control or sham. We defined sham training as using a resistance of less than 30% of PImax. We accepted control groups if they did not receive any intervention or received an intervention other than exercise training to blind participants\u00a0(e.g. therapeutic education). We made the exception for breathing exercises if participants in the control group did not receive more than one type of training (e.g. diaphragmatic breathing, pursed lips breathing), and the purpose was not to compare it with IMT.",
            "Types of outcome measures": "We analysed\u00a0the following outcomes in the review, but we did\u00a0not use them as a basis for including or excluding studies. Dyspnea: the essential scale for our primary analysis is the Borg scale (Borg 1982). We\u00a0only included the Borg score when it was measured at isotime. We analysed all the scales reported by the trials as long as they were validated, and when possible, we combined them in a meta\u2010analysis. The other\u00a0included scales were:\u00a0Baseline and Transition Dyspnea Indexes (BDI\u2010TDI) (Mahler 2005),\u00a0and Modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) (Bestall 1999). Functional exercise capacity: this can be assessed through multiple tests. We did not exclude studies based on the test used. However, for our analysis, we considered\u00a0that the most important measurement is the six\u2010minute walk distance (6MWD) (Holland 2014). Therefore, we included it in the summary of findings table and considered it for subgroup analysis. We included other tests and reported them either in qualitative or quantitative analysis. Health\u2010related quality of life: we accepted any scales as long as they were validated. This includes the\u00a0St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) (Jones 1992), the chronic respiratory questionnaire (CRQ) (Wijkstra 1994) and the COPD assessment test (CAT) (Jones 2009). Inspiratory muscle strength: measured by maximal static inspiratory mouth pressure (PImax) (Laveneziana 2019). Laboratory exercise tests: we were primarily interested in the maximal oxygen uptake (VO2peak), which could\u00a0be measured through: incremental cycle ergometer test;   endurance cycle ergometer test;   treadmill test. incremental cycle ergometer test; endurance cycle ergometer test; treadmill test. Respiratory muscle endurance: Respiratory muscle endurance pressure (Pthmax): measured by incremental load testing (Laveneziana 2019). It is the maximally tolerated pressure when breathing against a continuously increasing load.    Respiratory muscle endurance time (Tlim): measured by constant load testing (Laveneziana 2019). It is the time an individual can maintain breathing against a fixed load. It can be carried out either through a threshold/resistive or isocapnic hyperpnea device.    Maximal voluntary ventilation (MVV): this is the total volume of expired air between 12 seconds to 15 seconds of deep and fast respiration. MVV is usually compared to predicted MVV (calculated through the forced expiratory volume at 1 second) (Wood 2017).

Respiratory function: forced expiratory volume at 1 second (FEV1)   residual volume forced expiratory volume at 1 second (FEV1) residual volume Adverse events: as defined by the trial authors. We\u00a0collected outcomes irrespective of the time frame and summary statistics (change from baseline or final values), with a preference for change score. For each trial, we analysed only the\u00a0outcomes listed above and not all the outcomes reported in the trial. However, we included all the tests and measurements used for the same outcome.",

We included abstracts if they reported at least the number of participants in each group, the duration of the intervention, and the training load.\u00a0We accepted trials with more than two arms. We excluded observational studies, quasi\u2010RCTs and cross\u2010over trials since no washout period for IMT has been established. We\u00a0included people with COPD diagnosed according to international standards (GOLD 2022), at any stage of the disease.\u00a0We placed no restrictions\u00a0on age, duration, setting, or the kind of pulmonary rehabilitation. We planned to include\u00a0RCTs with different conditions for the same intervention of interest as long as we could obtain the data of participants with COPD separately.

IMT plus PR versus PR   IMT versus no treatment or sham IMT plus PR versus PR IMT versus no treatment or sham First, we\u00a0included trials that explored the benefit of combining IMT and PR compared to PR only. PR consists of, but is not limited to, exercise training, physiotherapy, therapeutic education, and nutritional and psychosocial care (McCarthy 2015). We included different types of IMT irrespective of the mode of delivery: resistance training (high load, low frequency) or endurance training (low load, high frequency), device (i.e. threshold loading, resistive flow device, isocapnic hyperpnea). We made\u00a0no restrictions on the duration, supervision (home\u2010based or in a healthcare setting), or timing (during hospitalization or later) of the intervention. We\u00a0excluded studies where the training was conducted only once\u00a0per week (face\u2010to\u2010face or distance sessions), regardless of the total duration of the clinical trial. The minimum accepted training load\u00a0was\u00a030% of PImax or more\u00a0(Hill 2010). We also excluded trials that used a resistive device without controlling the breathing pattern. If a study conducted an incremental\u00a0training load that started\u00a0less than 30% of PImax, we\u00a0considered only the follow\u2010up\u00a0from which the load was equal to our threshold. According to the proportion of supervised sessions, we defined supervision as: under 20%: unsupervised;\u00a0\u00a0   20% to 70%: partially supervised; and\u00a0\u00a0   above 70%: fully supervised. under 20%: unsupervised; 20% to 70%: partially supervised; and above 70%: fully supervised. For the second comparison, we compared IMT with control or sham. We defined sham training as using a resistance of less than 30% of PImax. We accepted control groups if they did not receive any intervention or received an intervention other than exercise training to blind participants\u00a0(e.g. therapeutic education). We made the exception for breathing exercises if participants in the control group did not receive more than one type of training (e.g. diaphragmatic breathing, pursed lips breathing), and the purpose was not to compare it with IMT. We analysed\u00a0the following outcomes in the review, but we did\u00a0not use them as a basis for including or excluding studies. Dyspnea: the essential scale for our primary analysis is the Borg scale (Borg 1982). We\u00a0only included the Borg score when it was measured at isotime. We analysed all the scales reported by the trials as long as they were validated, and when possible, we combined them in a meta\u2010analysis. The other\u00a0included scales were:\u00a0Baseline and Transition Dyspnea Indexes (BDI\u2010TDI) (Mahler 2005),\u00a0and Modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) (Bestall 1999). Functional exercise capacity: this can be assessed through multiple tests. We did not exclude studies based on the test used. However, for our analysis, we considered\u00a0that the most important measurement is the six\u2010minute walk distance (6MWD) (Holland 2014). Therefore, we included it in the summary of findings table and considered it for subgroup analysis. We included other tests and reported them either in qualitative or quantitative analysis. Health\u2010related quality of life: we accepted any scales as long as they were validated. This includes the\u00a0St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) (Jones 1992), the chronic respiratory questionnaire (CRQ) (Wijkstra 1994) and the COPD assessment test (CAT) (Jones 2009). Inspiratory muscle strength: measured by maximal static inspiratory mouth pressure (PImax) (Laveneziana 2019). Laboratory exercise tests: we were primarily interested in the maximal oxygen uptake (VO2peak), which could\u00a0be measured through: incremental cycle ergometer test;   endurance cycle ergometer test;   treadmill test. incremental cycle ergometer test; endurance cycle ergometer test; treadmill test. Respiratory muscle endurance: Respiratory muscle endurance pressure (Pthmax): measured by incremental load testing (Laveneziana 2019). It is the maximally tolerated pressure when breathing against a continuously increasing load.    Respiratory muscle endurance time (Tlim): measured by constant load testing (Laveneziana 2019). It is the time an individual can maintain breathing against a fixed load. It can be carried out either through a threshold/resistive or isocapnic hyperpnea device.    Maximal voluntary ventilation (MVV): this is the total volume of expired air between 12 seconds to 15 seconds of deep and fast respiration. MVV is usually compared to predicted MVV (calculated through the forced expiratory volume at 1 second) (Wood 2017).

        "title": "Systemic opioid regimens for postoperative pain in neonates",
        "abstract": "Background Postoperative pain clinical management in neonates has always been a challenging medical issue. Worldwide, several systemic opioid regimens are available for pediatricians, neonatologists, and general practitioners to control pain in neonates undergoing surgical procedures. However, the most effective and safe regimen is still unknown in the current body of literature.    Objectives To determine the effects of different regimens of systemic opioid analgesics in neonates submitted to surgery on all\u2010cause mortality, pain, and significant neurodevelopmental disability. Potentially assessed regimens might include: different doses of the same opioid, different routes of administration of the same opioid, continuous infusion versus bolus administration, or 'as needed' administration versus 'as scheduled' administration.    Search methods Searches were conducted in June 2022 using the following databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials [CENTRAL], PubMed, and CINAHL. Trial registration records were identified via CENTRAL and an independent search of the ISRCTN registry.    Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi\u2010randomized, cluster\u2010randomized, and cross\u2010over controlled trials evaluating systemic opioid regimens' effects on postoperative pain in neonates (pre\u2010term or full\u2010term). We considered suitable for inclusion: I) studies evaluating different doses of the same opioid; 2) studies evaluating different routes of administration of the same opioid; 3) studies evaluating the effectiveness of continuous infusion versus bolus infusion; and 4) studies establishing an assessment of an 'as needed' administration versus 'as scheduled' administration.    Data collection and analysis According to Cochrane methods, two investigators independently screened retrieved records, extracted data, and appraised the risk of bias. We stratified meta\u2010analysis by the type of intervention: studies evaluating the use of opioids for postoperative pain in neonates through continuous infusion versus bolus infusion and studies assessing the 'as needed' administration versus 'as scheduled' administration. We used the fixed\u2010effect model with risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous data and mean difference (MD), standardized mean difference (SMD), median, and interquartile range (IQR) for continuous data. Finally, we used the GRADEpro approach for primary outcomes to evaluate the quality of the evidence across included studies.    Main results In this review, we included seven randomized controlled clinical trials (504 infants) from 1996 to 2020. We identified no studies comparing different doses of the same opioid, or different routes. The administration of continuous opioid infusion versus bolus administration of opioids was evaluated in six studies, while one study compared 'as needed' versus 'as scheduled' administration of morphine given by parents or nurses. Overall, the effectiveness of continuous infusion of opioids over bolus infusion as measured by the visual analog scale (MD 0.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) \u20100.23 to 0.23; 133 participants, 2 studies; I\u00b2 = 0); or using the COMFORT scale (MD \u20100.07, 95% CI \u20100.89 to 0.75; 133 participants, 2 studies; I\u00b2 = 0), remains unclear due to study designs' limitations, such as the unclear risk of attrition, reporting bias, and imprecision among reported results (very low certainty of the evidence). \u00a0None of the included studies reported data on other clinically important outcomes such as all\u2010cause mortality rate during hospitalization, major neurodevelopmental disability, the incidence of severe retinopathy of prematurity or intraventricular hemorrhage, and cognitive\u2010 and educational\u2010related outcomes.\u00a0    Authors' conclusions Limited evidence is available on continuous infusion compared to intermittent boluses of systemic opioids. We are uncertain whether continuous opioid infusion reduces pain compared with intermittent opioid boluses; none of the studies reported the other primary outcomes of this review, i.e. all\u2010cause mortality during initial hospitalization, significant neurodevelopmental disability, or cognitive and educational outcomes among children older than five years old. Only one small study reported on morphine infusion with parent\u2010 or nurse\u2010controlled analgesia.",

            "Appendix 2. Risk of bias tool": "We used the standard methods of Cochrane and Cochrane Neonatal to assess the methodological quality of the trials. For each trial, we sought information regarding the method of randomization, blinding, and reporting of all outcomes of all the infants enrolled in the trial. We assessed each criterion as being at a low, high, or unclear risk of bias. Two review authors separately assessed each study. We resolved any disagreements by discussion. We added this information to the 'Characteristics of included studies' table. We evaluated the following issues and entered the findings into the Risk of bias table.   1. Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias). Was the allocation sequence adequately generated?  For each included study, we will categorize the method used to generate the allocation sequence as:     low risk (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);    high risk (any non\u2010random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number); or    unclear risk.      2. Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias). Was allocation adequately concealed?  For each included study, we will categorize the method used to conceal the allocation sequence as:     low risk (e.g. telephone or central randomization; consecutively numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes);    high risk (open random allocation; unsealed or non\u2010opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth); or    unclear risk      3. Blinding of participants and personnel (checking for possible performance bias). Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study?  For each included study, we will categorize the methods used to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We will assess blinding separately for different outcomes or class of outcomes. We will categorize the methods as:     low risk, high risk, or unclear risk for participants; and   low risk, high risk, or unclear risk for personnel.      4.

        "title": "Experiences of conditional and unconditional cash transfers intended for improving health outcomes and health service use: a qualitative evidence synthesis",
        "abstract": "Background It is well known that poverty is associated with ill health and that ill health can result in direct and indirect costs that can perpetuate poverty. Social protection, which includes policies and programmes intended to prevent and reduce poverty in times of ill health, could be one way to break this vicious cycle. Social protection, particularly cash transfers, also has the potential to promote healthier behaviours, including healthcare seeking. Although social protection, particularly conditional and unconditional cash transfers, has been widely studied, it is not well known how recipients experience social protection interventions, and what unintended effects such interventions can cause.\u00a0\u00a0    Objectives The aim of this review was to explore how conditional and unconditional cash transfer social protection interventions with a health outcome are experienced and perceived by their recipients.\u00a0    Search methods We searched Epistemonikos, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Social Services Abstracts, Global Index Medicus, Scopus, AnthroSource and EconLit from the start of the database to 5 June 2020. We combined this with reference checking, citation searching, grey literature and contact with authors to identify additional studies.\u00a0We reran all strategies in July 2022, and the new studies are awaiting classification.    Selection criteria We included primary studies, using qualitative methods or mixed\u2010methods studies with qualitative research reporting on recipients\u2019 experiences of cash transfer interventions where health outcomes were evaluated. Recipients could be adult patients of healthcare services, the general adult population as recipients of cash targeted at themselves or directed at children. Studies could be evaluated on any mental or physical health condition or cash transfer mechanism. Studies could come from any country and be in any language. Two authors independently selected studies.\u00a0    Data collection and analysis We used a multi\u2010step purposive sampling framework for selecting studies, starting with geographical representation, followed by health condition, and richness of data. Key data were extracted by the authors into Excel. Methodological limitations were assessed independently using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) criteria by two authors. Data were synthesised using meta\u2010ethnography, and confidence in findings was assessed using the Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research (GRADE\u2010CERQual) approach.\u00a0    Main results We included 127 studies in the review and sampled 41 of these studies for our analysis. Thirty\u2010two further studies were found after the updated search on 5 July 2022 and are awaiting classification. The sampled studies were from 24 different countries: 17 studies were from the African region, seven were from the region of the Americas, seven were from the European region, six were from the South\u2010East Asian region, three from the Western Pacific region and one study was multiregional, covering both the African and the Eastern Mediterranean regions. These studies primarily explored the views and experiences of cash transfer recipients with different health conditions, such as infectious diseases, disabilities and long\u2010term illnesses, sexual and reproductive health, and maternal and child health. Our GRADE\u2010CERQual assessment indicated we had mainly moderate\u2010 and high\u2010confidence findings. We found that recipients perceived the cash transfers as necessary and helpful for immediate needs and, in some cases, helpful for longer\u2010term benefits. However, across conditional and unconditional programmes, recipients often felt that the amount given was too little in relation to their total needs. They also felt that the cash alone was not enough to change their behaviour and, to change behaviour, additional types of support would be required. The cash transfer was reported to have important effects on empowerment, autonomy and agency, but also in some settings, recipients experienced pressure from family or programme staff on cash usage. The cash transfer was reported to improve social cohesion and reduce intrahousehold tension. However, in settings where some received the cash and others did not, the lack of an equal approach caused tension, suspicion and conflict. Recipients also reported stigma in terms of cash transfer programme assessment processes and eligibility, as well as inappropriate eligibility processes. Across settings, recipients experienced barriers in accessing the cash transfer programme, and some refused or were hesitant to receive the cash. Some recipients found cash transfer programmes more acceptable when they agreed with the programme's goals and processes.\u00a0\u00a0    Authors' conclusions Our findings highlight the impact of the sociocultural context on the functioning and interaction between the individual, family and cash transfer programmes. Even where the goals of a cash transfer programme are explicitly health\u2010related, the outcomes may be far broader than health alone and may include, for example, reduced stigma, empowerment and increased agency of the individual. When measuring programme outcomes, therefore, these broader impacts could be considered for understanding the health and well\u2010being benefits of cash transfers.",

            "Types of studies": "We included primary studies that used qualitative or mixed\u2010methods study designs. The qualitative designs in this study included different qualitative study approaches, including ethnography, phenomenology, case studies, generic descriptive qualitative studies and qualitative process evaluations. We included studies that used qualitative methods for data collection (including focus group discussions, semistructured and in\u2010depth individual interviews, observation and open\u2010ended web surveys) and that used qualitative methods for data analysis (including thematic analysis, grounded theory, framework analysis, and content analysis). We excluded studies that collected data qualitatively but analysed them using quantitative methods (e.g. open\u2010ended survey questions where the response data are analysed using descriptive statistics only), as qualitative approaches are considered the most appropriate to understand the perceptions and experiences of recipients. We included mixed\u2010methods studies, where it was possible to extract the data that were collected and analysed using qualitative methods, and we used only the qualitative component of the study for analysis. We included studies published in any language. We included studies regardless of whether or not they were conducted alongside studies of the effectiveness of cash transfers included in\u00a0Lagarde 2009\u00a0and\u00a0Pega 2022. We did not use a quality threshold and we did not exclude studies based on our assessment of methodological limitations. We used the information about methodological limitations to assess our confidence in the review findings, using the GRADE\u2010CERQual approach (GRADE\u2010CERQual 2022). We searched databases from their inception to 5 June 2020 and the search was updated in July 2022. The new studies found are awaiting classification.",
            "Topic of interest": "We included studies that reported on experiences or perceptions from recipients of cash transfer interventions provided by governmental, non\u2010governmental or international agencies, or private non\u2010 or for\u2010profit agencies targeted for improving health or health behaviours or that were assessed for health outcomes. We included different types of cash transfer interventions, which we categorised as unconditional cash transfers (UCT), conditional cash transfers (CCT), or cash\u2010plus interventions that could include either a conditional or unconditional cash transfer component.\u00a0 We defined a UCT programme as non\u2010contributory monetary payments to individuals by governmental, international or non\u2010governmental organisations to help them meet minimum consumption needs (Garcia 2012). A CCT programme is defined as similar non\u2010contributory monetary payments to individuals if a condition, typically a behaviour requirement, is fulfilled. We defined cash\u2010plus interventions as programmes where either unconditional or conditional cash was given together with additional services, such as health checks, training or education sessions, psychosocial support or referrals to social services The types of participants in the studies included recipients or carers of recipients of conditional or unconditional cash transfers or cash\u2010plus interventions.\u00a0 We defined the recipients or carers as people who received a cash transfer as part of a government, non\u2010government or project\u2010based initiative.\u00a0 Participants could be: adult patients of healthcare services;   the general adult population where the programme was assessed in terms of health impact or provided for purposes of initiating, maintaining or increasing preventive or curative health behaviours (e.g. vaccination, treatment adherence, contraceptive use or testing or screening for diseases) or the avoidance of unhealthy behaviours (e.g. smoking cessation);    adult caregiver recipients where the cash transfers were intended to benefit those receiving care, including but not limited to, children. adult patients of healthcare services; the general adult population where the programme was assessed in terms of health impact or provided for purposes of initiating, maintaining or increasing preventive or curative health behaviours (e.g. vaccination, treatment adherence, contraceptive use or testing or screening for diseases) or the avoidance of unhealthy behaviours (e.g. smoking cessation); adult caregiver recipients where the cash transfers were intended to benefit those receiving care, including but not limited to, children. We conducted a global review, which was not limited to any particular setting or geographic location. Participants in the studies could come from any healthcare setting, primary, secondary and tertiary, or they could be outside the formal healthcare setting. We included any physical or mental health condition of participants.

        "criteria_text": "We included primary studies that used qualitative or mixed\u2010methods study designs. The qualitative designs in this study included different qualitative study approaches, including ethnography, phenomenology, case studies, generic descriptive qualitative studies and qualitative process evaluations. We included studies that used qualitative methods for data collection (including focus group discussions, semistructured and in\u2010depth individual interviews, observation and open\u2010ended web surveys) and that used qualitative methods for data analysis (including thematic analysis, grounded theory, framework analysis, and content analysis). We excluded studies that collected data qualitatively but analysed them using quantitative methods (e.g. open\u2010ended survey questions where the response data are analysed using descriptive statistics only), as qualitative approaches are considered the most appropriate to understand the perceptions and experiences of recipients. We included mixed\u2010methods studies, where it was possible to extract the data that were collected and analysed using qualitative methods, and we used only the qualitative component of the study for analysis. We included studies published in any language. We included studies regardless of whether or not they were conducted alongside studies of the effectiveness of cash transfers included in\u00a0Lagarde 2009\u00a0and\u00a0Pega 2022. We did not use a quality threshold and we did not exclude studies based on our assessment of methodological limitations. We used the information about methodological limitations to assess our confidence in the review findings, using the GRADE\u2010CERQual approach (GRADE\u2010CERQual 2022). We searched databases from their inception to 5 June 2020 and the search was updated in July 2022. The new studies found are awaiting classification. We included studies that reported on experiences or perceptions from recipients of cash transfer interventions provided by governmental, non\u2010governmental or international agencies, or private non\u2010 or for\u2010profit agencies targeted for improving health or health behaviours or that were assessed for health outcomes. We included different types of cash transfer interventions, which we categorised as unconditional cash transfers (UCT), conditional cash transfers (CCT), or cash\u2010plus interventions that could include either a conditional or unconditional cash transfer component.\u00a0 We defined a UCT programme as non\u2010contributory monetary payments to individuals by governmental, international or non\u2010governmental organisations to help them meet minimum consumption needs (Garcia 2012). A CCT programme is defined as similar non\u2010contributory monetary payments to individuals if a condition, typically a behaviour requirement, is fulfilled. We defined cash\u2010plus interventions as programmes where either unconditional or conditional cash was given together with additional services, such as health checks, training or education sessions, psychosocial support or referrals to social services The types of participants in the studies included recipients or carers of recipients of conditional or unconditional cash transfers or cash\u2010plus interventions.\u00a0 We defined the recipients or carers as people who received a cash transfer as part of a government, non\u2010government or project\u2010based initiative.\u00a0 Participants could be: adult patients of healthcare services;   the general adult population where the programme was assessed in terms of health impact or provided for purposes of initiating, maintaining or increasing preventive or curative health behaviours (e.g. vaccination, treatment adherence, contraceptive use or testing or screening for diseases) or the avoidance of unhealthy behaviours (e.g. smoking cessation);    adult caregiver recipients where the cash transfers were intended to benefit those receiving care, including but not limited to, children. adult patients of healthcare services; the general adult population where the programme was assessed in terms of health impact or provided for purposes of initiating, maintaining or increasing preventive or curative health behaviours (e.g. vaccination, treatment adherence, contraceptive use or testing or screening for diseases) or the avoidance of unhealthy behaviours (e.g. smoking cessation); adult caregiver recipients where the cash transfers were intended to benefit those receiving care, including but not limited to, children. We conducted a global review, which was not limited to any particular setting or geographic location. Participants in the studies could come from any healthcare setting, primary, secondary and tertiary, or they could be outside the formal healthcare setting. We included any physical or mental health condition of participants. We included studies focused on conditional cash transfers, unconditional cash transfers, or cash\u2010plus interventions, where cash was paid to individuals by governmental, international or non\u2010governmental organisations in connection to national or local social protection programmes or research studies.

        "title": "Prognostic factors for the development and progression of proliferative diabetic retinopathy in people with diabetic retinopathy",
        "abstract": "Background Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is characterised by neurovascular degeneration as a result of chronic hyperglycaemia. Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is the most serious complication of DR and can lead to total (central and peripheral) visual loss. PDR is characterised by the presence of abnormal new blood vessels, so\u2010called \u201cnew vessels,\u201d at the optic disc (NVD) or elsewhere in the retina (NVE). PDR can progress to high\u2010risk characteristics (HRC) PDR (HRC\u2010PDR), which is defined by the presence of NVD more than one\u2010fourth to one\u2010third disc area in size plus vitreous haemorrhage or pre\u2010retinal haemorrhage, or vitreous haemorrhage or pre\u2010retinal haemorrhage obscuring more than one disc area. In severe cases, fibrovascular membranes grow over the retinal surface and tractional retinal detachment with sight loss can occur, despite treatment. Although most, if not all, individuals with diabetes will develop DR if they live long enough, only some progress to the sight\u2010threatening PDR stage.\u00a0    Objectives To determine risk factors for the development of PDR and HRC\u2010PDR in people with diabetes and DR.    Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register; 2022, Issue 5), Ovid MEDLINE, and Ovid Embase. The date of the search was 27 May 2022. Additionally, the search was supplemented by screening reference lists of eligible articles. There were no restrictions to language or year of publication.\u00a0    Selection criteria We included prospective or retrospective cohort studies and case\u2010control longitudinal studies evaluating prognostic factors for the development and progression of PDR, in people who have not had previous treatment for DR. The target population consisted of adults (\u226518 years of age) of any gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and geographical location, with non\u2010proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) or PDR with less than HRC\u2010PDR, diagnosed as per standard clinical practice. Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts, and full\u2010text articles, to determine eligibility; discrepancies were resolved through discussion. We considered prognostic factors measured at baseline and any other time points during the study and in any clinical setting. Outcomes were evaluated at three and eight years (\u00b1 two years) or lifelong.\u00a0    Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data from included studies using a data extraction form that we developed and piloted prior to the data collection stage. We resolved any discrepancies through discussion. We used the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool to assess risk of bias. We conducted meta\u2010analyses in clinically relevant groups using a random\u2010effects approach. We reported hazard ratios (HR), odds ratios (OR), and risk ratios (RR) separately for each available prognostic factor and outcome, stratified by different time points. Where possible, we meta\u2010analysed adjusted prognostic factors. We evaluated the certainty of the evidence with an adapted version of the GRADE framework. \u00a0    Main results We screened 6391 records. From these, we identified 59 studies (87 articles) as eligible for inclusion. Thirty\u2010five were prospective cohort studies, 22 were retrospective studies, 18 of which were cohort and six were based on data from electronic registers, and two were retrospective case\u2010control studies. Twenty\u2010three studies evaluated participants with type 1 diabetes (T1D), 19 with type 2 diabetes (T2D), and 17 included mixed populations (T1D and T2D). Studies on T1D included between 39 and 3250 participants at baseline, followed up for one to 45 years. Studies on T2D included between 100 and 71,817 participants at baseline, followed up for one to 20 years. The studies on mixed populations of T1D and T2D ranged from 76 to 32,553 participants at baseline, followed up for four to 25 years.\u00a0  We found evidence indicating that higher glycated haemoglobin (haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)) levels (adjusted OR ranged from 1.11 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 1.32) to 2.10 (95% CI 1.64 to 2.69) and more advanced stages of retinopathy (adjusted OR ranged from 1.38 (95% CI 1.29 to 1.48) to 12.40 (95% CI 5.31 to 28.98) are independent risk factors for the development of PDR in people with T1D and T2D. We rated the evidence for these factors as of moderate certainty because of moderate to high risk of bias in the studies.\u00a0  There was also some evidence suggesting several markers for renal disease (for example, nephropathy (adjusted OR ranged from 1.58 (95% CI not reported) to 2.68 (2.09 to 3.42), and creatinine (adjusted meta\u2010analysis HR 1.61 (95% CI 0.77 to 3.36)), and, in people with T1D, age at diagnosis of diabetes (< 12 years of age) (standardised regression estimate 1.62, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.48), increased triglyceride levels (adjusted RR 1.55, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.95), and larger retinal venular diameters (RR 4.28, 95% CI 1.50 to 12.19) may increase the risk of progression to PDR. The certainty of evidence for these factors, however, was low to very low, due to risk of bias in the included studies, inconsistency (lack of studies preventing the grading of consistency or variable outcomes), and imprecision (wide CIs). There was no substantial and consistent evidence to support duration of diabetes, systolic or diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, low\u2010 (LDL) and high\u2010 (HDL) density lipoproteins, gender, ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), socioeconomic status, or tobacco and alcohol consumption as being associated with incidence of PDR. There was insufficient evidence to evaluate prognostic factors associated with progression of PDR to HRC\u2010PDR.\u00a0    Authors' conclusions Increased HbA1c is likely to be associated with progression to PDR; therefore, maintaining adequate glucose control throughout life, irrespective of stage of DR severity, may help to prevent progression to PDR and risk of its sight\u2010threatening complications. Renal impairment in people with T1D or T2D, as well as younger age at diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (DM), increased triglyceride levels, and increased retinal venular diameters in people with T1D may also be associated with increased risk of progression to PDR. Given that more advanced DR severity is associated with higher risk of progression to PDR, the earlier the disease is identified, and the above systemic risk factors are controlled, the greater the chance of reducing the risk of PDR and saving sight.",

Any appropriate studies including a subset of relevant participants were considered as potentially eligible if data from this subset were given separately.",
            "Types of prognostic factors": "This review considered and included prognostic factor studies only. Specific prognostic factors of interest included, but were not restricted to: routinely collected patient demographics and information, such as age, gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and smoking habits;    frequently obtained standard clinical data, such as comorbidities (presence/absence of cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, nephropathy and specifically chronic kidney failure (defined as estimated GFR of < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2), peripheral neuropathy and specifically foot ulcers, amputation), BMI, neck/waist circumference, glycated haemoglobin, blood pressure, low\u2010density lipoprotein, high\u2010density lipoprotein, triglycerides; and    functional and structural retinal biomarkers in the prognostic context of the development and progression of PDR. routinely collected patient demographics and information, such as age, gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and smoking habits; frequently obtained standard clinical data, such as comorbidities (presence/absence of cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, nephropathy and specifically chronic kidney failure (defined as estimated GFR of < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2), peripheral neuropathy and specifically foot ulcers, amputation), BMI, neck/waist circumference, glycated haemoglobin, blood pressure, low\u2010density lipoprotein, high\u2010density lipoprotein, triglycerides; and functional and structural retinal biomarkers in the prognostic context of the development and progression of PDR. We excluded studies evaluating prognostic factors involving invasive procedures that cannot be practically undertaken in a clinical setting (such as aqueous/vitreous sampling) and are thus unlikely to be translatable to routine clinical practice. We expected that prognostic factors would generally have been measured at the time participants entered the studies, and indeed after diagnosis of DR or PDR. If measures of prognostic factors were available at other time points, and these coincided in more than one study, we planned to consider investigating them at these other time points.",
            "Types of outcomes to be predicted": "The development of PDR was determined by the presence of NVD or NVE, as diagnosed based on fundus examination, fundus photography, or fundus fluorescein angiography. We considered participants requiring laser treatment for PDR specifically to have progressed to the outcome of PDR. Progression from less than HRC\u2010PDR to HRC\u2010PDR. HRC\u2010PDR was defined according to the ETDRS as: i) NVD 0.5 disc area plus vitreous haemorrhage or pre\u2010retinal haemorrhage; ii) vitreous haemorrhage or pre\u2010retinal haemorrhage obscuring more than one disc area (Diabetic Retinopathy Study Research Group 1991). These features could have been determined by clinical examination or by the grading of ophthalmic images, both fundus photography and fundus fluorescein angiograms. Participants requiring laser treatment for HRC\u2010PDR specifically were considered as having progressed to the outcome of HRC\u2010PDR. The time horizon for the evaluation of health outcomes in this review was three years (\u00b1 two years), eight years (\u00b1 two years), or lifelong, if available.

Any appropriate studies including a subset of relevant participants were considered as potentially eligible if data from this subset were given separately. This review considered and included prognostic factor studies only.

        "title": "Remote care through telehealth for people with inflammatory bowel disease",
        "abstract": "Background People with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) require intensive follow\u2010up with frequent consultations after diagnosis. IBD telehealth management includes consulting by phone, instant messenger, video, text message, or web\u2010based services. Telehealth can be beneficial for people with IBD, but may have its own set of challenges. It is important to systematically review the evidence on the types of remote or telehealth approaches that can be deployed in IBD. This is particularly relevant following the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\u201019) pandemic, which led to increased self\u2010 and remote\u2010management.    Objectives To identify the communication technologies used to achieve remote healthcare for people with inflammatory bowel disease and to assess their effectiveness.    Search methods On 13 January 2022, we searched CENTRAL, Embase, MEDLINE, three other databases, and three trials registries with no limitations on language, date, document type, or publication status.    Selection criteria All published, unpublished, and ongoing randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated telehealth interventions targeted at people with IBD versus any other type of intervention or no intervention.  We did not include studies based on digital patient information resources or education resources, unless they formed part of a wider package including an element of telehealth. We excluded studies where remote monitoring of blood or faecal tests was the only form of monitoring.    Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data from the included studies and assessed their risk of bias. We analysed studies on adult and paediatric populations separately. We expressed the effects of dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RRs) and the effects of continuous outcomes as mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs), each with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE methodology.    Main results We included 19 RCTs with a total of 3489 randomised participants, aged eight to 95 years. Three studies examined only people with ulcerative colitis (UC), two studies examined only people with Crohn's disease (CD), and the remaining studies examined a mix of IBD patients. Studies considered a range of disease activity states. The length of the interventions ranged from six months to two years. The telehealth interventions were web\u2010based and telephone\u2010based.  Web\u2010based monitoring versus usual care  Twelve studies compared web\u2010based disease monitoring to usual care. Three studies, all in adults, provided data on disease activity. Web\u2010based disease monitoring (n = 254) is probably equivalent to usual care (n = 174) in reducing disease activity in people with IBD (SMD 0.09, 95% CI \u22120.11 to 0.29). The certainty of the evidence is moderate.  Five studies on adults provided dichotomous data that we could use for a meta\u2010analysis on flare\u2010ups. Web\u2010based disease monitoring (n = 207/496) is probably equivalent to usual care (n = 150/372) for the occurrence of flare\u2010ups or relapses in adults with IBD (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.27). The certainty of the evidence is moderate. One study provided continuous data. Web\u2010based disease monitoring (n = 465) is probably equivalent to usual care (n = 444) for the occurrence of flare\u2010ups or relapses in adults with CD (MD 0.00 events, 95% CI \u22120.06 to 0.06). The certainty of the evidence is moderate. One study provided dichotomous data on flare\u2010ups in a paediatric population. Web\u2010based disease monitoring (n = 28/84) may be equivalent to usual care (n = 29/86) for the occurrence of flare\u2010ups or relapses in children with IBD (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.51). The certainty of the evidence is low.  Four studies, all in adults, provided data on quality of life. Web\u2010based disease monitoring (n = 594) is probably equivalent to usual care (n = 505) for quality of life in adults with IBD (SMD 0.08, 95% CI \u22120.04 to 0.20). The certainty of the evidence is moderate.  Based on continuous data from one study in adults, we found that web\u2010based disease monitoring probably leads to slightly higher medication adherence compared to usual care (MD 0.24 points, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.47). The results are of moderate certainty. Based on continuous data from one paediatric study, we found no difference between web\u2010based disease monitoring and usual care in terms of their effect on medication adherence (MD 0.00, 95% CI \u22120.63 to 0.63), although the evidence is very uncertain. When we meta\u2010analysed dichotomous data from two studies on adults, we found no difference between web\u2010based disease monitoring and usual care in terms of their effect on medication adherence (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.21), although the evidence is very uncertain.  We were unable to draw any conclusions on the effects of web\u2010based disease monitoring compared to usual care on healthcare access, participant engagement, attendance rate, interactions with healthcare professionals, and cost\u2010 or time\u2010effectiveness. The certainty of the evidence is very low.    Authors' conclusions The evidence in this review suggests that web\u2010based disease monitoring is probably no different to standard care in adults when considering disease activity, occurrence of flare\u2010ups or relapse, and quality of life. There may be no difference in these outcomes in children, but the evidence is limited. Web\u2010based monitoring probably increases medication adherence slightly compared to usual care.  We are uncertain about the effects of web\u2010based monitoring versus usual care on our other secondary outcomes, and about the effects of the other telehealth interventions included in our review, because the evidence is limited.  Further studies comparing web\u2010based disease monitoring to standard care for the clinical outcomes reported in adults are unlikely to change our conclusions, unless they have longer follow\u2010up or investigate under\u2010reported outcomes or populations. Studies with a clearer definition of web\u2010based monitoring would enhance applicability, enable practical dissemination and replication, and enable alignment with areas identified as important by stakeholders and people affected by IBD.",

        "abstract": "Background Antipsychotic drugs are the mainstay treatment for schizophrenia, yet they are associated with diverse and potentially dose\u2010related side effects which can reduce quality of life. For this reason, the lowest possible doses of antipsychotics are generally recommended, but higher doses are often used in clinical practice. It is still unclear if and how antipsychotic doses could be reduced safely in order to minimise the adverse\u2010effect burden without increasing the risk of relapse.    Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of reducing antipsychotic dose compared to continuing the current dose for people with schizophrenia.    Search methods We conducted a systematic search on 10 February 2021 at the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study\u2010Based Register of Trials, which is based on CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov, ISRCTN, and WHO ICTRP. We also inspected the reference lists of included studies and previous reviews.    Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any dose reduction against continuation in people with schizophrenia or related disorders who were stabilised on their current antipsychotic treatment.\u00a0    Data collection and analysis At least two review authors independently screened relevant records for inclusion, extracted data from eligible studies, and assessed the risk of bias using RoB 2. We contacted study authors for missing data and additional information. Our primary outcomes were clinically important change in quality of life, \u00a0rehospitalisations and dropouts due to adverse effects; key secondary outcomes were clinically important change in functioning, relapse, dropouts for any reason, and at least one adverse effect. We also examined scales measuring symptoms, quality of life, and functioning as well as a comprehensive list of specific adverse effects. We pooled outcomes at the endpoint preferably closest to one year. We evaluated the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.    Main results We included 25 RCTs, of which 22 studies provided data with 2635 participants (average age 38.4 years old). The median study sample size was 60 participants (ranging from 18 to 466 participants) and length was 37 weeks (ranging from 12 weeks to 2 years). There were variations in the dose reduction strategies in terms of speed of reduction (i.e. gradual in about half of the studies (within 2 to 16 weeks) and abrupt in the other half), and in terms of degree of reduction (i.e. median planned reduction of 66% of the dose up to complete withdrawal in three studies). We assessed risk of bias across outcomes predominantly as some concerns or high risk.\u00a0  No study reported data on the number of participants with a clinically important change in quality of life or functioning, and only eight studies reported continuous data on scales measuring quality of life or functioning. There was no difference between dose reduction and continuation on scales measuring quality of life (standardised mean difference (SMD) \u22120.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) \u22120.17 to 0.15, 6 RCTs, n = 719, I2 = 0%, moderate certainty evidence) and scales measuring functioning (SMD 0.03, 95% CI \u22120.10 to 0.17, 6 RCTs, n = 966, I2 = 0%, high certainty evidence).  Dose reduction in comparison to continuation may increase the risk of rehospitalisation based on data from eight studies with estimable effect sizes; however, the 95% CI does not exclude the possibility of no difference (risk ratio (RR) 1.53, 95% CI 0.84 to 2.81, 8 RCTs, n = 1413, I2 = 59% (moderate heterogeneity), very low certainty evidence). Similarly, dose reduction increased the risk of relapse based on data from 20 studies (RR 2.16, 95% CI 1.52 to 3.06, 20 RCTs, n = 2481, I2 = 70% (substantial heterogeneity), low certainty evidence). \u00a0  More participants in the dose reduction group in comparison to the continuation group left the study early due to adverse effects (RR 2.20, 95% CI 1.39 to 3.49, 6 RCTs with estimable effect sizes, n = 1079, I2 = 0%, moderate certainty evidence) and for any reason (RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.81, 12 RCTs, n = 1551, I2 = 48% (moderate heterogeneity), moderate certainty evidence).  Lastly, there was no difference between the dose reduction and continuation groups in the number of participants with at least one adverse effect based on data from four studies with estimable effect sizes (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.12, 5 RCTs, n = 998 (4 RCTs, n = 980 with estimable effect sizes), I2 = 0%, moderate certainty evidence).\u00a0    Authors' conclusions This review synthesised the latest evidence on the reduction of antipsychotic doses for stable individuals with schizophrenia. There was no difference between dose reduction and continuation groups in quality of life, functioning, and number of participants with at least one adverse effect. However, there was a higher risk for relapse and dropouts, and potentially for rehospitalisations, with dose reduction. Of note, the majority of the trials focused on relapse prevention rather potential beneficial outcomes on quality of life, functioning, and adverse effects, and in some studies there was rapid and substantial reduction of doses. Further well\u2010designed RCTs are therefore needed to provide more definitive answers.",

        "title": "Case management for integrated care of older people with frailty in community settings",
        "abstract": "Background Ageing populations globally have contributed to increasing numbers of people living with frailty, which has significant implications for use of health and care services and costs. The British Geriatrics Society defines frailty as \"a distinctive health state related to the ageing process in which multiple body systems gradually lose their inbuilt reserves\". This leads to an increased susceptibility to adverse outcomes, such as reduced physical function, poorer quality of life, hospital admissions, and mortality. Case management interventions delivered in community settings are led by a health or social care professional, supported by a multidisciplinary team, and focus on the planning, provision, and co\u2010ordination of care to meet the needs of the individual. Case management is one model of integrated care that has gained traction with policymakers to improve outcomes for populations at high risk of decline in health and well\u2010being. These populations include older people living with frailty, who commonly have complex healthcare and social care needs but can experience poorly co\u2010ordinated care due to fragmented care systems.    Objectives To assess the effects of case management for integrated care of older people living with frailty compared with usual care.    Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Health Systems Evidence, and PDQ Evidence and databases from inception to 23 September 2022. We also searched clinical registries and relevant grey literature databases, checked references of included trials and relevant systematic reviews, conducted citation searching of included trials, and contacted topic experts.    Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared case management with standard care in community\u2010dwelling people aged 65 years and older living with frailty.    Data collection and analysis We followed standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane and the Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence.    Main results We included 20 trials (11,860 participants), all of which took place in high\u2010income countries. Case management interventions in the included trials varied in terms of organisation, delivery, setting, and care providers involved. Most trials included a variety of healthcare and social care professionals, including nurse practitioners, allied healthcare professionals, social workers, geriatricians, physicians, psychologists, and clinical pharmacists. In nine trials, the case management intervention was delivered by nurses only. Follow\u2010up ranged from three to 36 months. We judged most trials at unclear risk of selection and performance bias; this consideration, together with indirectness, justified downgrading the certainty of the evidence to low or moderate.  Case management compared to standard care may result in little or no difference in the following outcomes.  \u2022 Mortality at 12 months' follow\u2010up (7.0% in the intervention group versus 7.5% in the control group; risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.84 to 1.15; I2 = 11%; 14 trials, 9924 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence)\u2022 Change in place of residence to a nursing home at 12 months' follow\u2010up (9.9% in the intervention group versus 13.4% in the control group; RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.01; I2 = 0%; 4 trials, 1108 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence)\u2022 Quality of life at three to 24 months' follow\u2010up (results not pooled; mean differences (MDs) ranged from \u22126.32 points (95% CI \u221211.04 to \u22121.59) to 6.1 points (95% CI \u22123.92 to 16.12) when reported; 11 trials, 9284 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence)\u2022 Serious adverse effects at 12 to 24 months' follow\u2010up (results not pooled; 2 trials, 592 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence)\u2022 Change in physical function at three to 24 months' follow\u2010up (results not pooled; MDs ranged from \u22120.12 points (95% CI \u22120.93 to 0.68) to 3.4 points (95% CI \u22122.35 to 9.15) when reported; 16 trials, 10,652 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence)  Case management compared to standard care probably results in little or no difference in the following outcomes.  \u2022 Healthcare utilisation in terms of hospital admission at 12 months' follow\u2010up (32.7% in the intervention group versus 36.0% in the control group; RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.05; I2 = 43%; 6 trials, 2424 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence)\u2022 Change in costs at six to 36 months' follow\u2010up (results not pooled; 14 trials, 8486 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence), which usually included healthcare service costs, intervention costs, and other costs such as informal care.    Authors' conclusions We found uncertain evidence regarding whether case management for integrated care of older people with frailty in community settings, compared to standard care, improved patient and service outcomes or reduced costs.

            "Types of studies": "We included RCTs, of both individual and cluster design, that evaluated case management for integrated care of older people with frailty versus usual care. An initial scoping of the literature indicated sufficient numbers of RCTs to include in a meta\u2010analysis in this review. We included all trials, however old, conducted in high\u2010, middle\u2010 and low\u2010income countries. We included full\u2010text, peer\u2010reviewed publications, conference abstracts (with a view to identifying full trials), and unpublished data. We included trials irrespective of their publication status and language of publication. We excluded trials with non\u2010randomised designs (e.g. interrupted time series) or that used observational methods only.",
            "Types of participants": "We included men and women aged 65 years and older who met the following criteria. Identified as frail using criteria defined by trial authors   Living in a community setting (i.e. individuals living in their own home, retirement housing, or sheltered accommodation, but not those living in a nursing or residential home care setting)    Not medically unwell (i.e. not receiving acute medical care) Identified as frail using criteria defined by trial authors Living in a community setting (i.e. individuals living in their own home, retirement housing, or sheltered accommodation, but not those living in a nursing or residential home care setting) Not medically unwell (i.e. not receiving acute medical care) Two dominant models of frailty are the phenotypical model and the cumulative deficit model. The phenotypical model categorises frailty as a clinical syndrome, specifically meeting three or more of the following five criteria: weight loss, exhaustion, weak grip strength, slow walking speed, and low physical activity (Fried 2001). The cumulative deficit model conceptualises frailty as a multidimensional state, including physical, psychological, and social domains of function, using a proportion of health deficits from the number of problems assessed (Searle 2008). Frailty criteria used by trial authors could include validated measures based on one of the models mentioned above. We considered a population eligible with regard to frailty when the trial met one of the following criteria. The trial used a measure of frailty as an inclusion criterion (applicable to trials published since the early 2000s when frailty started to be defined and measured in research and practice)    There was no definition of frailty but trial authors described their population as frail or described the intervention as intended for older people with frailty, and the frailty of the population was supported with a measure of function or dependency as an inclusion criterion, with specified cut\u2010off points.    The trial did not use a cut\u2010off score, but the function or dependency baseline data suggested a frail cohort. We used published normative data to make these decisions and determine cut\u2010off points in the measures presented. Where these measures could be found in validated frailty indices, we used the cut\u2010off points established in those indices. Otherwise, we made decisions based on age\u2010matched normative data.

            "Types of interventions": "We included all trials that evaluated case management for integrated care of older people living with frailty versus usual care. Eligible interventions met the following criteria. Led by a single health or social care professional (e.g. a nurse, social worker, or allied healthcare professional) who had a role in care delivery for older people with frailty and complex needs, supported by a multidisciplinary team.    Focused on the planning, provision, and co\u2010ordination of healthcare and social care to meet the needs of the older person living with frailty.    Delivered in community care settings (excluding care homes) and not acute care settings, with no minimum or maximum follow\u2010up period to assess outcomes.    May include comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA), but only if a case management approach is applied to the CGA process. We excluded CGA without any structured follow\u2010up or a designated lead healthcare or social care professional. A case management approach to CGA would be indicated by:    planned and structured ongoing support after the initial assessment process;   a healthcare or social care professional leading the support; and   use of the support to plan, provide or co\u2010ordinate care.

The comparison for this review was case management versus usual care (as described by trial authors, usually involving assessment, management, and care planning by a general practitioner (GP) in primary care) for older people with frailty delivered in community care settings. We provided a description of care for the intervention and control groups in the\u00a0Characteristics of included studies\u00a0table, using the template for intervention description and replication (TIDieR) checklist (Hoffmann 2014).",

Identified as frail using criteria defined by trial authors   Living in a community setting (i.e. individuals living in their own home, retirement housing, or sheltered accommodation, but not those living in a nursing or residential home care setting)    Not medically unwell (i.e. not receiving acute medical care) Identified as frail using criteria defined by trial authors Living in a community setting (i.e. individuals living in their own home, retirement housing, or sheltered accommodation, but not those living in a nursing or residential home care setting) Not medically unwell (i.e. not receiving acute medical care) Two dominant models of frailty are the phenotypical model and the cumulative deficit model. The phenotypical model categorises frailty as a clinical syndrome, specifically meeting three or more of the following five criteria: weight loss, exhaustion, weak grip strength, slow walking speed, and low physical activity (Fried 2001). The cumulative deficit model conceptualises frailty as a multidimensional state, including physical, psychological, and social domains of function, using a proportion of health deficits from the number of problems assessed (Searle 2008). Frailty criteria used by trial authors could include validated measures based on one of the models mentioned above. We considered a population eligible with regard to frailty when the trial met one of the following criteria. The trial used a measure of frailty as an inclusion criterion (applicable to trials published since the early 2000s when frailty started to be defined and measured in research and practice)    There was no definition of frailty but trial authors described their population as frail or described the intervention as intended for older people with frailty, and the frailty of the population was supported with a measure of function or dependency as an inclusion criterion, with specified cut\u2010off points.    The trial did not use a cut\u2010off score, but the function or dependency baseline data suggested a frail cohort. We used published normative data to make these decisions and determine cut\u2010off points in the measures presented. Where these measures could be found in validated frailty indices, we used the cut\u2010off points established in those indices. Otherwise, we made decisions based on age\u2010matched normative data.

        "title": "Interventions for myopia control in children: a living systematic review and network meta\u2010analysis",
        "abstract": "Background Myopia is a common refractive error, where elongation of the eyeball causes distant objects to appear blurred. The increasing prevalence of myopia is a growing global public health problem, in terms of rates of uncorrected refractive error and significantly, an increased risk of visual impairment due to myopia\u2010related ocular morbidity. Since myopia is usually detected in children before 10 years of age and can progress rapidly, interventions to slow its progression need to be delivered in childhood.    Objectives To assess the comparative efficacy of optical, pharmacological and environmental interventions for slowing myopia progression in children using network meta\u2010analysis (NMA). To generate a relative ranking of myopia control interventions according to their efficacy. To produce a brief economic commentary, summarising the economic evaluations assessing myopia control interventions in children. To maintain the currency of the evidence using a living systematic review approach.\u00a0    Search methods We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register), MEDLINE; Embase; and three trials registers. The search date was 26 February 2022.\u00a0    Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of optical, pharmacological and environmental interventions for slowing myopia progression in children aged 18 years or younger. Critical outcomes were progression of myopia (defined as the difference in the change in spherical equivalent refraction (SER, dioptres (D)) and axial length (mm) in the intervention and control groups at one year or longer) and difference in the change in SER and axial length following cessation of treatment ('rebound').\u00a0    Data collection and analysis We followed standard Cochrane methods. We assessed bias using RoB 2 for parallel RCTs. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for the outcomes: change in SER and axial length at one and two years. Most comparisons were with inactive controls.    Main results We included 64 studies that randomised 11,617 children, aged 4 to 18 years. Studies were mostly conducted in China or other Asian countries (39 studies, 60.9%) and North America (13 studies, 20.3%). Fifty\u2010seven studies (89%) compared myopia control interventions (multifocal spectacles, peripheral plus spectacles (PPSL), undercorrected single vision spectacles (SVLs), multifocal soft contact lenses (MFSCL), orthokeratology, rigid gas\u2010permeable contact lenses (RGP); or pharmacological interventions (including high\u2010 (HDA), moderate\u2010 (MDA) and low\u2010dose (LDA) atropine, pirenzipine or 7\u2010methylxanthine) against an inactive control. Study duration was 12 to 36 months. The overall certainty of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate.  Since the networks in the NMA were poorly connected, most estimates versus control were as, or more, imprecise than the corresponding direct estimates. Consequently, we mostly report estimates based on direct (pairwise) comparisons below.  At one year, in 38 studies (6525 participants analysed), the median change in SER for controls was \u22120.65 D. The following interventions may reduce SER progression compared to controls: HDA (mean difference (MD) 0.90 D, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 1.18), MDA (MD 0.65 D, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.03), LDA (MD 0.38 D, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.66), pirenzipine (MD 0.32 D, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.49), MFSCL (MD 0.26 D, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.35), PPSLs (MD 0.51 D, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.82), and multifocal spectacles (MD 0.14 D, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.21). By contrast, there was little or no evidence that RGP (MD 0.02 D, 95% CI \u22120.05 to 0.10), 7\u2010methylxanthine (MD 0.07 D, 95% CI \u22120.09 to 0.24) or undercorrected SVLs (MD \u22120.15 D, 95% CI \u22120.29 to 0.00) reduce progression.\u00a0  At two years, in 26 studies (4949 participants), the median change in SER for controls was \u22121.02 D. The following interventions may reduce SER progression compared to controls: HDA (MD 1.26 D, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.36), MDA (MD 0.45 D, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.83), LDA (MD 0.24 D, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.31), pirenzipine (MD 0.41 D, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.69), MFSCL (MD 0.30 D, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.41), and multifocal spectacles \u00a0(MD 0.19 D, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.30). PPSLs (MD 0.34 D, 95% CI \u22120.08 to 0.76) may also reduce progression, but the results were inconsistent. For RGP, one study found a benefit and another found no difference with control. We found no difference in SER change for undercorrected SVLs (MD 0.02 D, 95% CI \u22120.05 to 0.09).  At one year, in 36 studies (6263 participants), the median change in axial length for controls was 0.31 mm. The following interventions may reduce axial elongation compared to controls: HDA (MD \u22120.33 mm, 95% CI \u22120.35 to 0.30), MDA (MD \u22120.28 mm, 95% CI \u22120.38 to \u22120.17), LDA (MD \u22120.13 mm, 95% CI \u22120.21 to \u22120.05), orthokeratology (MD \u22120.19 mm, 95% CI \u22120.23 to \u22120.15), MFSCL (MD \u22120.11 mm, 95% CI \u22120.13 to \u22120.09), pirenzipine (MD \u22120.10 mm, 95% CI \u22120.18 to \u22120.02), PPSLs (MD \u22120.13 mm, 95% CI \u22120.24 to \u22120.03), and multifocal spectacles (MD \u22120.06 mm, 95% CI \u22120.09 to \u22120.04). We found little or no evidence that RGP (MD 0.02 mm, 95% CI \u22120.05 to 0.10), 7\u2010methylxanthine (MD 0.03 mm, 95% CI \u22120.10 to 0.03) or undercorrected SVLs (MD 0.05 mm, 95% CI \u22120.01 to 0.11) reduce axial length.  At two years, in 21 studies (4169 participants), the median change in axial length for controls was 0.56 mm. The following interventions may reduce axial elongation compared to controls: HDA (MD \u22120.47mm, 95% CI \u22120.61 to \u22120.34), MDA (MD \u22120.33 mm, 95% CI \u22120.46 to \u22120.20), orthokeratology (MD \u22120.28 mm, (95% CI \u22120.38 to \u22120.19), LDA (MD \u22120.16 mm, 95% CI \u22120.20 to \u00a0\u22120.12), MFSCL (MD \u22120.15 mm, 95% CI \u22120.19 to \u22120.12), and multifocal spectacles (MD \u22120.07 mm, 95% CI \u22120.12 to \u22120.03). PPSL may reduce progression (MD \u22120.20 mm, 95% CI \u22120.45 to 0.05) but results were inconsistent. We found little or no evidence that undercorrected SVLs (MD \u20100.01 mm, 95% CI \u22120.06 to 0.03) or RGP (MD 0.03 mm, 95% CI \u22120.05 to 0.12) reduce axial length.  There was inconclusive evidence on whether treatment cessation increases myopia progression. Adverse events and treatment adherence were not consistently reported, and only one study reported quality of life.  No studies reported environmental interventions reporting progression in children with myopia, and no economic evaluations assessed interventions for myopia control in children.    Authors' conclusions Studies mostly compared pharmacological and optical treatments to slow the progression of myopia with an inactive comparator. Effects at one year provided evidence that these interventions may slow refractive change and reduce axial elongation, although results were often heterogeneous. A smaller body of evidence is available at two or three years, and uncertainty remains about the sustained effect of these interventions. Longer\u2010term and better\u2010quality studies comparing myopia control interventions used alone or in combination are needed, and improved methods for monitoring and reporting adverse effects.",

        "title": "Interventions to improve sanitation for preventing diarrhoea",
        "abstract": "Background Diarrhoea is a major contributor to the global disease burden, particularly amongst children under five years in low\u2010 and middle\u2010income countries (LMICs). As many of the infectious agents associated with diarrhoea are transmitted through faeces, sanitation interventions to safely contain and manage human faeces have the potential to reduce exposure and diarrhoeal disease.    Objectives To assess the effectiveness of sanitation interventions for preventing diarrhoeal disease, alone or in combination with other WASH interventions.    Search methods We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and Chinese language databases available under the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI\u2010CAJ). We also searched the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) and conference proceedings, contacted researchers, and searched references of included studies. The last search date was 16 February 2022.    Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi\u2010RCTs, non\u2010randomized controlled trials (NRCTs), controlled before\u2010and\u2010after studies (CBAs), and matched cohort studies of interventions aimed at introducing or expanding the coverage and/or use of sanitation facilities in children and adults in any country or population. Our primary outcome of interest was diarrhoea and secondary outcomes included dysentery (bloody diarrhoea), persistent diarrhoea, hospital or clinical visits for diarrhoea, mortality, and adverse events. We included sanitation interventions whether they were conducted independently or in combination with other interventions.    Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed eligible studies, extracted relevant data, assessed risk of bias, and assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. We used meta\u2010analyses to estimate pooled measures of effect, described results narratively, and investigated potential sources of heterogeneity using subgroup analyses.    Main results Fifty\u2010one studies met our inclusion criteria, with a total of 238,535 participants. Of these, 50 studies had sufficient information to be included in quantitative meta\u2010analysis, including 17 cluster\u2010RCTs and 33 studies with non\u2010randomized study designs (20 NRCTs, one CBA, and 12 matched cohort studies). Most were conducted in LMICs and 86% were conducted in whole or part in rural areas. Studies covered three broad types of interventions: (1) providing access to any sanitation facility to participants without existing access practising open defecation, (2) improving participants' existing sanitation facility, or (3) behaviour change messaging to improve sanitation access or practices without providing hardware or subsidy, although many studies overlapped multiple categories. There was substantial heterogeneity amongst individual study results for all types of interventions.  Providing access to any sanitation facility  Providing access to sanitation facilities was evaluated in seven cluster\u2010RCTs, and may reduce diarrhoea prevalence in all age groups (risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 1.08; 7 trials, 40,129 participants, low\u2010certainty evidence). In children under five years, access may have little or no effect on diarrhoea prevalence (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.16, 4 trials, 16,215 participants, low\u2010certainty evidence). Additional analysis in non\u2010randomized studies was generally consistent with these findings. Pooled estimates across randomized and non\u2010randomized studies provided similar protective estimates (all ages: RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.94; 15 studies, 73,511 participants; children < 5 years: RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.02; 11 studies, 25,614 participants).\u00a0  Sanitation facility improvement  Interventions designed to improve existing sanitation facilities were evaluated in three cluster\u2010RCTs in children under five and may reduce diarrhoea prevalence (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.06; 3 trials, 14,900 participants, low\u2010certainty evidence). However, some of these interventions, such as sewerage connection, are not easily randomized. Non\u2010randomized studies across participants of all ages provided estimates that improving sanitation facilities may reduce diarrhoea, but may be subject to confounding (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.74; 23 studies, 117,639 participants, low\u2010certainty evidence). Pooled estimates across randomized and non\u2010randomized studies provided similar protective estimates (all ages: RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.78; 26 studies, 132,539 participants; children < 5 years: RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.91, 12 studies, 23,353 participants).\u00a0  Behaviour change messaging only (no hardware or subsidy provided)  Strategies to promote behaviour change to construct, upgrade, or use sanitation facilities were evaluated in seven cluster\u2010RCTs in children under five, and probably reduce diarrhoea prevalence (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.98; 7 studies, 28,909 participants, moderate\u2010certainty evidence). Additional analysis from two non\u2010randomized studies found no effect, though with very high uncertainty. Pooled estimates across randomized and non\u2010randomized studies provided similar protective estimates (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.01; 9 studies, 31,080 participants). No studies measured the effects of this type of intervention in older populations.\u00a0  Any sanitation intervention  A pooled analysis of cluster\u2010RCTs across all sanitation interventions demonstrated that the interventions may reduce diarrhoea prevalence in all ages (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.95, 17 trials, 83,938 participants, low\u2010certainty evidence) and children under five (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.97; 14 trials, 60,024 participants, low\u2010certainty evidence). Non\u2010randomized comparisons also demonstrated a protective effect, but may be subject to confounding. Pooled estimates across randomized and non\u2010randomized studies provided similar protective estimates (all ages: RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.82; 50 studies, 237,130 participants; children < 5 years: RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.89; 32 studies, 80,047 participants). In subgroup analysis, there was some evidence of larger effects in studies with increased coverage amongst all participants (75% or higher coverage levels) and also some evidence that the effect decreased over longer follow\u2010up times for children under five years.  There was limited evidence on other outcomes. However, there was some evidence that any sanitation intervention was protective against dysentery (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.00; 5 studies, 34,025 participants) and persistent diarrhoea (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.75; 2 studies, 2665 participants), but not against clinic visits for diarrhoea (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.67; 2 studies, 3720 participants) or all\u2010cause mortality (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.89 to1.09; 7 studies, 46,123 participants).    Authors' conclusions There is evidence that sanitation interventions are effective at preventing diarrhoea, both for young children and all age populations. The actual level of effectiveness, however, varies by type of intervention and setting. There is a need for research to better understand the factors that influence effectiveness.",

            "Types of studies": "We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi\u2010RCTs, non\u2010randomized controlled trials (NRCTs), controlled before\u2010and\u2010after studies (CBAs), and matched cohort studies. For randomized trials, we included studies with a unit of randomization of individuals, families, households, villages, communities, or other clusters. For cluster\u2010RCTs, we only included studies that had at least two clusters per arm. For CBAs, we only included studies that had at least two sites per arm and contemporaneous data collection in the intervention and control arms. For matched cohort studies, we only included studies that had at least two sites per arm. A matched cohort study is a rigorous observational study method that allows for causal inference to be assessed from a non\u2010randomized pre\u2010existing development intervention implemented at a group or community level (Arnold 2010). A quasi\u2010RCT refers to a controlled trial that uses a method of participant allocation that is not truly random, but that is intended to produce similar groups as randomization (for example, allocation by date of birth, medical record number, or every other person) (Cochrane Community 2018). We used Cochrane EPOC's definitions of NRCTs and CBAs to differentiate between the two study design types, with both types of studies including an intervention study with a control and intervention group that is non\u2010randomized and measures outcomes in both groups after (and sometimes before) the intervention (Cochrane EPOC 2019). However, if allocation of the intervention to control and intervention groups was made by the investigators, then we classified it as a NRCT and if allocation to control and intervention groups was not under the control of the investigator, then we classified it as a CBA. If the study did not report who allocated the intervention to control and intervention groups, we classified the study as a NRCT. In this review, we expanded the inclusion criteria of\u00a0Clasen 2010\u00a0to include controlled before\u2010and\u2010after and matched cohort studies, two types of relatively rigorous non\u2010randomized study designs. The inclusion of rigorous non\u2010randomized studies of sanitation interventions enables the review to address important interventions that are not readily randomized, such as municipal sewerage and other downstream measures to manage faecal sludge beyond the user interface. The differences they present from RCTs in terms of causal inference can be adequately managed by subgroup analysis and risk of bias assessment.",

            "Types of interventions": "The interventions relevant to this review are aimed at introducing or expanding the coverage and/or use of sanitation facilities designed to reduce direct or indirect contact with human faeces. Our systematic review evaluated the following three separate types of sanitation interventions. Providing access to any sanitation facility: interventions that provide participants who do not have access to a sanitation facility with access to some kind of sanitation facility. This includes constructing or subsidizing the construction of facilities for participants who practise open defecation.    Sanitation facility improvement: interventions that improve participants\u2019 existing sanitation facility. This may include upgrading access to a higher level of service (as defined by JMP for SDGs monitoring), although this upgrade is not necessary for the intervention to be classified as a sanitation facility improvement. Additionally, this may include interventions that encourage the building of new facilities including pit latrines, VIP latrines, composting toilets, and water\u2010sealed flush or pour\u2010flush toilets, as long as the facility is an improvement over the existing facility. It may also include interventions to promote the safe management of faecal sludge, such as pit emptying, sewerage connection, and composting or other treatment that could upgrade the sanitation level of service. This also includes providing individual household latrines to participants relying on shared sanitation.    Behaviour change messaging only: behaviour change interventions that encourage participants to increase sanitation access or improve the use of existing sanitation facilities without providing or improving facilities or providing subsidies for the same. However, these interventions may still include messaging to encourage participants to build a latrine for themselves or upgrade their existing latrine with their own funds or labour.

However, these interventions may still include messaging to encourage participants to build a latrine for themselves or upgrade their existing latrine with their own funds or labour. As many sanitation interventions fell into multiple categories (for example, providing new latrine access in some intervention households that had previously been open defecating while also improving latrines in other intervention households that already had access to a sanitation facility), we also included a final comparison in our meta\u2010analysis that includes any of the foregoing interventions. We also assigned these studies to one of the above three categories for our meta\u2010analysis by sanitation intervention type based on what we assessed to be the primary sanitation intervention. If the intervention included components of providing new latrine access to some households and improving existing latrines of other households, we assigned it to the infrastructure category which most households fell into. If the intervention included infrastructure and behaviour change components, we assigned the study to the relevant infrastructure category. We included sanitation interventions whether they were conducted independently or in combination with other interventions, such as interventions to improve water quality, water quantity or access, hygiene practices, and/or child nutrition. We encountered some studies with multiple intervention groups, such as studies with one arm receiving a sanitation intervention and another arm receiving a sanitation intervention coupled with water and hygiene interventions, with each compared to the same control arm. In such cases, we extracted the data comparing the sanitation\u2010only arm to the control arm to include in our analysis of sanitation\u2010only interventions, and extracted the data comparing the combined water, sanitation, and hygiene arm to the control arm to include in our analysis of combined sanitation intervention with water and/or hygiene interventions. We excluded interventions aimed solely at the safe disposal of child faeces, such as the promotion of potties, unless safe disposal of child faeces was part of a larger sanitation intervention covering adults and children. We also excluded interventions aimed solely at the containment of animal faeces. Although faeces from young children and animals may be important sources of exposure to faecal pathogens capable of infecting humans, other reviews focus specifically on the disposal of faeces from children (Majorin 2019) and animals (Penakalapati 2017). Finally, this review did not extend to interventions that are not aimed principally at the sanitary disposal and management of human faeces, thus it does not include efforts to promote the use of human waste in agricultural applications, or efforts to improve drainage, recycling or reuse of wastewater or stormwater, or management of solid waste. Study participants who practise open defecation or who continue to follow their current practices with respect to excreta disposal or faecal sludge management rather than the prescribed intervention. We excluded any controls that received a separate intervention to reduce diarrhoea that was not also introduced to the intervention arm. However, we included controls that received a separate intervention to reduce diarrhoea if that intervention was also introduced into the intervention group alongside the sanitation intervention.",

A matched cohort study is a rigorous observational study method that allows for causal inference to be assessed from a non\u2010randomized pre\u2010existing development intervention implemented at a group or community level (Arnold 2010). A quasi\u2010RCT refers to a controlled trial that uses a method of participant allocation that is not truly random, but that is intended to produce similar groups as randomization (for example, allocation by date of birth, medical record number, or every other person) (Cochrane Community 2018). We used Cochrane EPOC's definitions of NRCTs and CBAs to differentiate between the two study design types, with both types of studies including an intervention study with a control and intervention group that is non\u2010randomized and measures outcomes in both groups after (and sometimes before) the intervention (Cochrane EPOC 2019). However, if allocation of the intervention to control and intervention groups was made by the investigators, then we classified it as a NRCT and if allocation to control and intervention groups was not under the control of the investigator, then we classified it as a CBA. If the study did not report who allocated the intervention to control and intervention groups, we classified the study as a NRCT. In this review, we expanded the inclusion criteria of\u00a0Clasen 2010\u00a0to include controlled before\u2010and\u2010after and matched cohort studies, two types of relatively rigorous non\u2010randomized study designs. The inclusion of rigorous non\u2010randomized studies of sanitation interventions enables the review to address important interventions that are not readily randomized, such as municipal sewerage and other downstream measures to manage faecal sludge beyond the user interface. The differences they present from RCTs in terms of causal inference can be adequately managed by subgroup analysis and risk of bias assessment. Children and adults in any country or population. The interventions relevant to this review are aimed at introducing or expanding the coverage and/or use of sanitation facilities designed to reduce direct or indirect contact with human faeces. Our systematic review evaluated the following three separate types of sanitation interventions. Providing access to any sanitation facility: interventions that provide participants who do not have access to a sanitation facility with access to some kind of sanitation facility. This includes constructing or subsidizing the construction of facilities for participants who practise open defecation.    Sanitation facility improvement: interventions that improve participants\u2019 existing sanitation facility. This may include upgrading access to a higher level of service (as defined by JMP for SDGs monitoring), although this upgrade is not necessary for the intervention to be classified as a sanitation facility improvement. Additionally, this may include interventions that encourage the building of new facilities including pit latrines, VIP latrines, composting toilets, and water\u2010sealed flush or pour\u2010flush toilets, as long as the facility is an improvement over the existing facility. It may also include interventions to promote the safe management of faecal sludge, such as pit emptying, sewerage connection, and composting or other treatment that could upgrade the sanitation level of service. This also includes providing individual household latrines to participants relying on shared sanitation.    Behaviour change messaging only: behaviour change interventions that encourage participants to increase sanitation access or improve the use of existing sanitation facilities without providing or improving facilities or providing subsidies for the same. However, these interventions may still include messaging to encourage participants to build a latrine for themselves or upgrade their existing latrine with their own funds or labour.

However, these interventions may still include messaging to encourage participants to build a latrine for themselves or upgrade their existing latrine with their own funds or labour. As many sanitation interventions fell into multiple categories (for example, providing new latrine access in some intervention households that had previously been open defecating while also improving latrines in other intervention households that already had access to a sanitation facility), we also included a final comparison in our meta\u2010analysis that includes any of the foregoing interventions. We also assigned these studies to one of the above three categories for our meta\u2010analysis by sanitation intervention type based on what we assessed to be the primary sanitation intervention. If the intervention included components of providing new latrine access to some households and improving existing latrines of other households, we assigned it to the infrastructure category which most households fell into. If the intervention included infrastructure and behaviour change components, we assigned the study to the relevant infrastructure category. We included sanitation interventions whether they were conducted independently or in combination with other interventions, such as interventions to improve water quality, water quantity or access, hygiene practices, and/or child nutrition. We encountered some studies with multiple intervention groups, such as studies with one arm receiving a sanitation intervention and another arm receiving a sanitation intervention coupled with water and hygiene interventions, with each compared to the same control arm. In such cases, we extracted the data comparing the sanitation\u2010only arm to the control arm to include in our analysis of sanitation\u2010only interventions, and extracted the data comparing the combined water, sanitation, and hygiene arm to the control arm to include in our analysis of combined sanitation intervention with water and/or hygiene interventions. We excluded interventions aimed solely at the safe disposal of child faeces, such as the promotion of potties, unless safe disposal of child faeces was part of a larger sanitation intervention covering adults and children. We also excluded interventions aimed solely at the containment of animal faeces. Although faeces from young children and animals may be important sources of exposure to faecal pathogens capable of infecting humans, other reviews focus specifically on the disposal of faeces from children (Majorin 2019) and animals (Penakalapati 2017). Finally, this review did not extend to interventions that are not aimed principally at the sanitary disposal and management of human faeces, thus it does not include efforts to promote the use of human waste in agricultural applications, or efforts to improve drainage, recycling or reuse of wastewater or stormwater, or management of solid waste. Study participants who practise open defecation or who continue to follow their current practices with respect to excreta disposal or faecal sludge management rather than the prescribed intervention. We excluded any controls that received a separate intervention to reduce diarrhoea that was not also introduced to the intervention arm. However, we included controls that received a separate intervention to reduce diarrhoea if that intervention was also introduced into the intervention group alongside the sanitation intervention.

        "title": "Patient education interventions for the management of inflammatory bowel disease",
        "abstract": "Background Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a life\u2010long condition for which currently there is no cure. Patient educational interventions deliver structured information to their recipients. Evidence suggests patient education can have positive effects in other chronic diseases.    Objectives To identify the different types of educational interventions, how they are delivered, and to determine their effectiveness and safety in people with IBD.    Search methods On 27 November 2022, we searched CENTRAL, Embase, MEDLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP with no limitations to language, date, document type, or publication status. Any type of formal or informal educational intervention, lasting for any time, that had content focused directly on knowledge about IBD or skills needed for direct management of IBD or its symptoms was included. Delivery methods included face\u2010to\u2010face or remote educational sessions, workshops, guided study via the use of printed or online materials, the use of mobile applications, or any other method that delivers information to patients.    Selection criteria All published, unpublished and ongoing randomised control trials (RCTs) that compare educational interventions targeted at people with IBD to any other type of intervention or no intervention.    Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently conducted data extraction and risk of bias assessment of the included studies. We analysed data using Review Manager Web. We expressed dichotomous and continuous outcomes as risk ratios (RRs) and mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE methodology.    Main results We included 14 studies with a total of 2708 randomised participants, aged 11 to 75 years. Two studies examined populations who all had ulcerative colitis (UC); the remaining studies examined a mix of IBD patients (UC and Crohn's disease). Studies considered a range of disease activity states. The length of the interventions ranged from 30 minutes to 12 months. Education was provided in the form of in\u2010person workshops/lectures, and remotely via printed materials or multimedia, smartphones and internet learning.  Thirteen studies compared patient education interventions plus standard care against standard care alone. The interventions included seminars, information booklets, text messages, e\u2010learning, a multi professional group\u2010based programme, guidebooks, a staff\u2010delivered programme based on an illustrated book, a standardised programme followed by group session, lectures alternating with group therapy, educational sessions based on an IBD guidebook, internet blog access and text messages, a structured education programme, and interactive videos.  Risk of bias findings were concerning in all judgement areas across all studies. No single study was free of unclear or high of bias judgements.  Reporting of most outcomes in a homogeneous fashion was limited, with quality of life at study end reported most commonly in six of the 14 studies which allowed for meta\u2010analysis, with all other outcomes reported in a more heterogeneous manner that limited wider analysis. Two studies provided data on disease activity. There was no clear difference in disease activity when patient education (n = 277) combined with standard care was compared to standard care (n = 202). Patient education combined with standard care is probably equivalent to standard care in reducing disease activity in patients with IBD (standardised mean difference (SMD) \u20100.03, 95% CI \u20100.25 to 0.20), moderate\u2010certainty evidence.  Two studies provided continuous data on flare\u2010up/relapse. There was no clear difference for flare\u2010ups or relapse when patient education (n = 515) combined with standard care was compared to standard care (n = 507), as a continuous outcome. Patient education combined with standard care is probably equivalent to standard care in reducing flare\u2010ups or relapse in patients with IBD (MD \u20100.00, 95% CI \u20100.06 to 0.05; moderate\u2010certainty evidence).  Three studies provided dichotomous data on flare\u2010up/relapse. The evidence is very uncertain on whether patient education combined with standard care (n = 157) is different to standard care (n = 150) in reducing flare\u2010ups or relapse in patients with IBD (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.41 to 2.18; very low\u2010certainty evidence).  Six studies provided data on quality of life. There was no clear difference in quality of life when patient education combined with standard care (n = 721) was compared to standard care (n = 643). Patient education combined with standard care is probably equivalent to standard care in improving quality of life in patients with IBD (SMD 0.08, 95% CI \u20100.03 to 0.18; moderate\u2010certainty evidence).  The included studies did not report major differences on healthcare access. Medication adherence, patient knowledge and change in quality of life showed conflicting results that varied between no major differences and differences in favour of the educational interventions.  Only five studies reported on adverse events. Four reported zero total adverse events and one reported one case of breast cancer and two cases of surgery in their interventions groups, and zero adverse events in their control group.  Two studies compared delivery methods of patient education, specifically: web\u2010based patient education interventions versus colour\u2010printed books or text messages; and one study compared frequency of patient education, specifically: weekly educational text messages versus once every other week educational text messages. These did not show major differences for disease activity and quality of life.  Other outcomes were not reported.   Authors' conclusions The ways in which patient educational support surrounding IBD may impact on disease outcomes is complex.  There is evidence that education added to standard care is probably of no benefit to disease activity or quality of life when compared with standard care, and may be of no benefit for occurrence of relapse when compared with standard care. However, as there was a paucity of specific information regarding the components of education or standard care, the utility of these findings is questionable.  Further research on the impact of education on our primary outcomes of disease activity, flare\u2010ups/relapse and quality of life is probably not indicated. However, further research is necessary, which should focus on reporting details of the educational interventions and study outcomes that educational interventions could be directly targeted to address, such as healthcare access and medication adherence. These should be informed by direct engagement with stakeholders and people affected by Crohn's and colitis.",

Delivery methods can include face\u2010to\u2010face or remote educational sessions or workshops, guided study via the use of printed or online materials, the use of mobile applications or any other method that delivers information to patients. It became clear through data extraction that many papers did not mention details about standard therapies. Our team discussed this, and decided that it was highly unlikely that patients would be denied treatment in lieu of patient education or the control therapies. In addition, we could not assume the use of placebo if it was not mentioned by the authors.

        "criteria_text": "All published, unpublished and ongoing RCTs that compare educational interventions targeted at people with IBD to any other type of intervention or no intervention. Cluster\u2010randomised and cross\u2010over trials that met our criteria were included. People with IBD of all ages. Any type of formal or informal educational intervention, lasting for any time, that has content focused directly on knowledge about IBD or skills needed for direct management of IBD or its symptoms. Interventions that use education to deliver a different set of skills or outcomes that may by proxy enhance patients outcomes were not included (e.g. cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) training, hypnotherapy training, relaxation therapy training, training on how to use a remote or other health tool for monitoring disease, training on diagnostic tools). Delivery methods can include face\u2010to\u2010face or remote educational sessions or workshops, guided study via the use of printed or online materials, the use of mobile applications or any other method that delivers information to patients. It became clear through data extraction that many papers did not mention details about standard therapies. Our team discussed this, and decided that it was highly unlikely that patients would be denied treatment in lieu of patient education or the control therapies. In addition, we could not assume the use of placebo if it was not mentioned by the authors. We considered terms such as \u201cstandard care\u201d, \u201cusual care\u201d, \u201ctreatment as usual\u201d, \u201croutine follow\u2010up\u201d, as interchangeable. We recognise this is a source of clinical heterogeneity, as these terms can refer to different approaches of standard care which are not identical in every way, however, we agreed they were probably similar enough for the meta\u2010analysis purposes of this review. We have listed all intervention and comparator groups in the 'Characteristics of included studies' table. We considered both dichotomous and continuous outcomes for this review. These were not used as criteria for considering inclusion. Disease activity at study end, using a recognised disease activity scoring system as described by the study authors.
