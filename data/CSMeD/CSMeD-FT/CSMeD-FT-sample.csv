Lessons Learned from Patient Advisory Councils",MD Anjana E Sharma anjana.sharma@ucsf.edu,"Patient advisory councils (PACs) are a strategy for primary care clinics to engage patients in practice improvement. However, there is scant research on how PACs function. This study aimed to understand how PACs are organized and identify common challenges and perceived benefits of high-functioning PACs. Setting and Population: Key informants identified 8 primary care clinics in California with highfunctioning PACs. Leaders from each of the 8 clinics nominated 1 clinic staff member and 1 PAC patient member to be interviewed. Study Design: Semistructured, one-on-one interviews were conducted at each clinic site or by phone. Interviews were dual-coded using modified grounded theory. Common themes were identified that would be pertinent to the development of future best practices for running PACs. Results: Common characteristics of high-functioning PACs included careful attention to participant recruitment, facilitation strategies guiding diverse personalities toward a common purpose, and assigning accountability for practice improvement projects. Interviewees identified a variety of positive outcomes that ranged from tangible improvements to the waiting area to a more patient-centered staff culture. Conclusions: PACs show potential for promoting patient-centered practice improvements in primary care. Lessons learned from high-functioning PACs can inform a common set of strategies to assist practices in creating and sustaining effective advisory councils.(","Patient engagement, a concept growing in popularity, can be defined as partnership between patients, families, and caregivers to improve health care. 1 Typically, patient engagement is conceptu-alized as involving patients in their own individual care, but it can also be fostered at the level of the clinic or health care organization. 2 For example, patients can be engaged in clinic-level improvement using approaches such as Patient Advisory Councils (PACs), which is a criterion of the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) definition of the Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH). 3 PACs are groups of patients, family members, and caregivers who meet on a regular basis to help identify practice improvement priorities and support practice improvement projects in collaboration with clinic staff members and leaders. However, only a third of certified PCMHs engage patients at the practice level through programs such as PACs. 4 This may be because of the perceived effort required to organize PACs and limited data on the beneficial outcomes of such patient engagement activities. There is case-based evidence that inpatient advisory councils have had a positive effect on patient safety 5 and readmissions 6 ; however, less research has been performed in outpatient settings. One systematic review comprised primarily of case studies found that patient advisors helped improve clinic access and informational materials for patients. 7 Another study found that when patient advisors worked with staff to set clinic priorities, those priorities were more aligned with the tenets of the PCMH than when staff set priorities alone. 8 However, there is very little data on how PACs function within primary care clinics. This study aimed to use qualitative methods to learn more about both patient and staff experiences with PACs in the primary care setting, and to expand our limited understanding of how PACs are established and maintained at primary care clinics.MethodsSetting This qualitative study was part of a mixed-methods needs assessment of patient engagement at the practice level led by the Center for Excellence in Primary Care (CEPC) and the San Francisco Bay Area Collaborative Research Network (SFBayCRN) at the University of California San Francisco, in partnership with 2 principal regional stakeholders in patient engagement: the Western Clinician's Network, a membership-based organization for community health center leaders in Arizona, California, Hawaii, Nevada, and the Pacific Islands, and the Center for Care Innovations, a nonprofit focused on facilitating innovation and quality improvement in safety net settings.Sample Through meetings with local and regional leaders in the field of patient engagement in practice transformation, the research team identified high-func-tioning PACs within Northern California. The study team used a positive deviance sampling strategy, based on the approach that surveying organizations that excel in a challenging arena can help identify best practices. 9 With this approach, we met with key informants, primarily members of health care nonprofits with experience funding and facilitating patient engagement initiatives, who identified clinics with advisory councils that were considered ""high-functioning."" High-functioning PACs were considered to be so if they had PACs that had been operating for at least 6 months, were meeting on a regular basis, and had helped produce concrete improvements to clinic operations as identified by our key informants. Clinics agreeing to participate nominated 1 clinic staff member and 1 PAC patient member to be interviewed. Staff members interviewed were those considered to be most involved with their PAC. All participants provided informed consent. The study protocol was reviewed by the University of California San Francisco Committee on Human Research and determined to be exempt.Data Collection An interview guide was designed by the study authors to explore how PACs promote patient engagement within clinics. The interview guide explored how PACs were formed and managed, and how clinics took advantage of PACs to improve clinic operations (See Appendix 1 for instrument). The interview guide was pilot tested and refined with input from project partners experienced in working with PACs. Semistructured interviews were conducted individually in person or via telephone by a trained research assistant from May through August 2014. Interviews were conducted in English or Spanish. Interviewees were reimbursed with a $25.00 gift card for their time. Sites were recruited and interviews were conducted until the research team observed that no new concepts were arising from interviews, suggesting that thematic saturation was reached. 10Data Management and Analysis Interviews were transcribed, translated, and deidentified. Three members of the research group closely read all interviews and identified 16 main areas of interest that became the initial codes. Interviews were dual coded, in which each transcript was independently coded by 2 reviewers who dis-cussed any discrepancies and revised the codebook to reflect their consensus. Data were analyzed using modified grounded theory, 11, 12 in which ideas were allowed to emerge, although we had some framework of concepts approaching the data based on our prior experience with PACs. The coding progressed in an iterative process, with the team meeting frequently to refine the codebook. Disagreements or discrepancies in coding were resolved through discussion between coders and additional discussion with other research group members until agreement was reached. Dual-coded interviews were entered into Atlas.ti (Version 7.0, Atlas.ti Scientific Software Development, GmbH). 13 After dual coding all interviews, key findings were reviewed by the entire research group to confirm validation. Several major themes were derived from key findings. These themes were reviewed to identify variations between staff and patient respondents. The research group selected final themes based on prevalence among the interviewees and relevance for best practices.Results Of 13 nominated and invited clinics, 8 participated in the study, providing a total of 15 interviews. Two interviews were conducted at each site, 1 with a PAC staff member and 1 with a PAC patient member, with the exception of 1 clinic in which the clinic staff did not identify a patient leader to be interviewed. Interviews ranged from 45 to 60 minutes in length. Two patient interviews were con-ducted in Spanish. Four respondents (1 staff and 3 patients) self identified as Latino/a and 10 (7 staff and 3 patients) were female. PAC sized ranged from 7 to 15 members, and the duration of the PACs ranged from 6 months to 5 years. Of the 8 participating clinics, 5 served urban and 3 served rural areas. Seven of the organizations were family medicine specialty sites, and 1 was a general internal medicine site. Six of the sites were federally qualified health centers. Seven of the sites were safety-net clinics, and 1 site was a university-affiliated health center. A summary of the demographic details of clinic sites and PACs is listed in Table 1 . Four salient themes emerged from the interviews, roughly corresponding to the way a PAC is initially established (Logistics/Setup and Recruitment), the process of running a PAC meeting (Meeting Process), how PAC projects are implemented (Implementation/Followup), and the effect a PAC has on a clinic. A synthesis of proposed best practices culled from the data are listed in Table 2 , with 4 prominent themes discussed in detail below. The interviewees also described an array of impactful projects done in conjunction with PACs, which are listed in Table 3 and exemplify how these PACs were high functioning.Theme No. 1: Recruitment Strategies Aim to Identify Patient Members with Strong Communication Skills Who Are Reflective of the Demographics of the Patients Served Recruitment of patient members for PACs typically involved publicizing the group in the clinic, obtain- ing staff and provider nominations, and conducting interviews of nominated or interested patients as a ""vetting"" process before inviting them to be a PAC member. Staff interviewees described wanting to recruit the ""right patient"" to participate in an advisory council: someone who could communicate ideas but also listen to others and who could work in a group even when there were differing opinions; ""So in terms of patients, I guess picking or choosing patients to participate on an Advisory Board is a little tricky because you want someone who is able to share ideas but also listen to ideas…"" Another staff member described multiple aims for their recruitment strategy: ""We learned… that you cannot just take anybody who applies, okay? Even though you want to. The thing that is most important is not what they think so much as how they express it. And so when you are vetting a patient or family member for a council position, it is really critical that they are not combative, that they are able to represent a number of voices and to listen to a number of voices and that they can be representative of people who are unlike themselves. And of course they all represent themselves and so hopefully you can try to get as diverse a council as you can, but that is also another challenge."" Although clinic staff members described wanting to recruit patients with specific communication skills, all 8 respondents also mentioned the goal to recruit members who would be reflective of the diversity of a clinic's patient population. Five staff and 1 patient mentioned the challenges of recruiting PAC members who were younger in age, members of ethnic minorities, working patients or parents, male members, those of lower literacy, those with chronic illness, and members of sexual minority groups. Establishing an advisory council that is reflective of the patient population served seemedTheme No. 2: Skilled Facilitation Is Instrumental for Successful and Productive PAC Meetings and Projects All 8 sites designated a staff member or staff liaison as meeting facilitator; at 1 site a patient co-chair functioned as cofacilitator along with a designated staff member. Facilitators were responsible for providing a safe space for all members to be involved, including reigning in members who had more dominant communication styles that could overpower meetings. The role of a staff person to facilitate smoothly was described by 1 patient as akin to an orchestra conductor: ""…If we're to be the model of patient advisory, we have to work out these kinks and to function. Like, I see the facilitator as a conductor and we are the musicians. One plays cello, one plays violin, one plays the piano. We all play our own music, everybody does, and the conductor is to synchronize and harmonize."" Skilled facilitators were described to effectively nurture project ideas from the PAC, but also seek patient feedback on projects and programs introduced by the clinic. Facilitators helped to translate patient experiences into realistic projects, and triaged possible project ideas and identified those that were not feasible: ""It just seems that the staff members who are on the council and the clinicians who are on the council are helpful in guiding the patients to take their experience and putting it into some kind of practical project that both will find beneficial and useful."" Facilitators also transmitted information about PAC meetings to the rest of the clinic. Interestingly, many PAC facilitators described learning facilitation skills on the job without prior training. Over time, they developed confidence in their ability to mediate dominant members and usher group discussion more toward specific, achievable projects.Theme No. 3: Clarity between PAC Members and Clinic Staff Regarding Accountability Is Key for Project Implementation Respondents commonly discussed that PAC meetings foster conversation between patients and staff that generates ideas for practice improvement projects. However, there were differing expectations between staff and patients on who has primary responsibility for implementing clinic-level practice improvement projects. A majority of patients (6 patients, 1 staff) believed that it was the role of the clinic or staff liaison to work with the rest of the clinic to operationalize new projects. It was unclear whether this was an expectation that was promoted by clinic staff, but many patients described their staff or clinician liaison as taking responsibility for making progress on PAC projects: ""[the clinician] is a really in-the-know person here in the clinic. I do not know exactly what her position is, but she's got enough pull that she gets things done. And she takes our suggestions and gets them done."" Staff members were acknowledged as having more access to clinic logistics: ""there's a project that is happening here, but it takes the staff to integrate it… So a lot of the decision or action plan falls on their shoulders."" In contrast, 6 respondents (4 staff, 2 patients) opined that patients should assume a share of the responsibility for moving projects forward. One staff member described how project selection and facilitation can foster more accountability when the patients are engaged: ""So see, when they are passionate about it and when we can ask in a specific way to encourage them to be more involved, then it works. If we're not able to do that and if they are just not interested, then it will not work."" Staff liaisons alluded to being overburdened with PACspecific work, and the possibility of increased patient support was one possible strategy to offset their workload. One patient commented on a middle ground of shared accountability between patients and staff: ""If all the work had to be done by the clinic alone it would not be possible, so the patient has to cooperate too to make some changes, we have to work together, both patients and doctors."" Despite these challenges, the majority of respondents described a diverse array of successful clinic improvement projects implemented by PACs, including patient communication tools, clinical care, the clinic's physical space, and clinical workflows or systems (Table 3 ).Theme No. 4: By Spreading Awareness of a PAC and its Projects to the Clinic at Large, Clinics can Promote a Culture of Support and Buy-in for Patient Engagement Activities Of the many domains where patients and staff reported a PAC impact, a common finding was that over time, there was a notable change in ""clinic culture"" in which clinic staff became more receptive to patient-centered care, as well as more receptive to working with the PAC: ""From what I've experienced in the 4 years that I've been here now… [the PAC] makes a huge difference. It makes a huge difference about how providers think about how they interact with the patients, how the staff think about the work that they are doing, how patients feel involved in the care that they are receiving, versus being just something or a place they come to."" This change could happen early on, as a PAC begins to enact projects, or over time, as staff become more exposed to patient advisors and hear their experiences of care: ""And then the culture has also been transitioning and some of the verbiage that I hear around in different meetings, managers are starting to say 'this came from the PACs'. So then nobody questions it as much, so they are gaining a positive reputation."" Through this clinic culture change, PACs were described as having more authority or ""pull"" at a clinic, such that they became a resource or sounding board for new ideas. At sites that have invested in PACs, ongoing patient input was seen by staff as an essential component of achieving a culture of patient engagement: ""How can we talk about patient-centered care without having patients at the table?""Discussion Key informants from these high-performing PACs identified a number of best practices for establishing and maintaining a PAC, derived from common successes and challenges from PAC-clinic partnerships. As one of the few existing studies of PACs, our findings provide guidance for health care organizations interested in establishing an advisory council. Our findings provide insight that may help practitioners anticipate and address some of the challenges of PACs. Identifying patients with excellent communication skills as well as recruiting membership reflective of the patient population served emerged as dual and possibly competing priorities. By specifically recruiting excellent communicators, patients who may be more comfortable in facilitated meeting settings may be more likely to be nominated. These findings suggest that more time and resources are needed to recruit and support patients from hard-to-reach groups served by the clinic. Clinics may need to provide orientation and training to help prepare members who may be less experienced with group or meeting structures and processes. Clinic staff also need support to provide the robust facilitation needed for successful PACs. Staff members described a lack of preparation on how to facilitate meetings and a sense of learning facilitation skills on the job. This stands in contrast with other patient group programs such as Centering Pregnancy or group visits for chronic pain, which provide formal facilitation training to providers or staff. 14, 15 As PACs become more common in the primary care setting, a future best practice could include trainings for staff liaisons in group facilitation and conflict resolution to best prepare for mediating diverse and dominant communication styles in meetings. Of note, all participating clinics had a staff member serve as either the group facilitator or co-facilitator. Future PACs may encourage patient members or other personnel to take the lead in PAC meeting discussions. Our third finding identified dissonance between staff and patient perceptions of who is accountable to complete projects. Although staff members have a far better understanding of the inner logistics of a clinic and how to enact change, both staff and patient contributions are needed to operationalize projects. Having clear expectations regarding the time commitment and role of both the staff champion as well as patient members is a best practice that can help address this ambiguity. It was an unexpected finding that so many staff members described a transformation in clinic-wide culture after working with a PAC. Patients did not speak to this effect, which may be due to their lack of exposure to a clinic's inner workings and staff meetings where such changes in dynamics may be most noticeable. This resonates with a recent study of Accountable Care Organizations (ACO) that found a positive association between ACO use of patient engagement activities and ACO leaders' belief that patient engagement has a positive effect. 16 Although impactful projects were described by all respondents, the data did not reveal practical strategies to quantitatively evaluate the success of PACs, although some staff job responsibilities included monitoring patient experience measures. As PACs work with practice-improvement teams, developing metrics to assess PAC success is an important future area of inquiry. Although respondents did not describe metrics of success, there was overarching concordance that working with a PAC was worth the time it takes, which resonates with a recent cross-sectional survey conducted with practice leaders working in patient engagement at community health centers. 17 Limitations of this analysis include a small sample size and focus on Northern California, although we did capture both urban and rural sites. Our results are most generalizable to primary care health centers primarily serving the safety net in which system leadership supports patient engagement efforts. Given that there is no validated metric to identify if the clinics that were nominated actually had ""high-functioning"" advisory councils or not, our sampling strategy was based on key informant opinion and may not have included all eligible sites. Because we interviewed 1 staff and 1 patient member from clinics and had 1 study site that did not nominate a patient interviewee, we may have encountered reporting bias by focusing on engagement champions and patient leaders within advisory councils who were likely predisposed toward speaking more positively about councils. Similarly, the sites we interviewed may not experience the same barriers and challenges faced by clinics with newer or less successful PACs, which means we may not have identified all salient barriers. However, our goal was to conduct a positive-deviance study focusing on ""bright spots"" within advisory council work and highlight successes in the field. Our findings validate some of the case-based recommendations found in online resources, toolkits, and case studies about advisory councils. 18 For example, multiple toolkits recommend a PAC membership size range that includes 7 to 15 members, meeting on either a monthly or quarterly basis, and offering reimbursements. 19, 20 As discussed by our respondents, recruitment based on communication skills as well as to ensure a council reflects the patient population served are highlighted in online resources. 21 The positive culture change catalyzed by PACs is also mentioned as a benefit at other health care organizations who have invested in patient engagement. 20Conclusions This formative study found a number of practices that may be essential for successful PACs in primary care settings. These practices include an intentional recruitment strategy, providing facilitator training and support, making sure clinic and PAC have clear workflows establishing accountability for project implementation, and promoting awareness of PAC contributions. In our study, both patients and staff working with high-functioning PACs believed that their activities had a positive influence on clinic programs, clinic culture, and patient care. As the field of clinic-level patient engagement evolves, these practices can be tested in future interventions to understand more about the demonstrable effect of PACs.Patient engagement as transformation partners in primary care practices Interview/focus group guideConfirm permission to record once recorder is turned on Before we begin, may I have your permission to record this interview?

In many countries, health facility committees (HFCs) provide the accountability interface between health providers and citizens or users of health services. This article explores the social accountability practices facilitated by HFCs in Benin, Guinea and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Methods: The paper is based on a cross-case comparison of 11 HFCs across the three countries. The HFCs were purposefully selected based on the (past) presence of community participation support programs. The cases were derived from qualitative research involving document analysis as well as interviews and focus group discussions with health workers, citizens, committee members, and local authorities. Results: Most HFCs facilitate social accountability by engaging with health providers in person or through meetings to discuss service failures, leading to changes in the quality of services, such as improved health worker presence, the availability of night shifts, the display of drug prices and replacement of poorly functioning health workers. Social accountability practices are however often individualised and not systematic, and their success depends on HFC leadership and synergy with other community structures. The absence of remuneration for HFC members does not seem to affect HFC engagement in social accountability. Conclusions: Most HFCs in this study offer a social accountability forum, but the informal and non-systematic character and limited community consultation leave opportunities for the exclusion of voices of marginalised groups. More inclusive, coherent and authoritative social accountability practices can be developed by making explicit the mandate of HFC in the planning, monitoring, and supervision of health services; providing instruments for organising local accountability processes; strengthening opportunities for community input and feedback; and strengthening links to formal administrative accountability mechanisms in the health system.","Background Since the 1978 Alma-Ata Declaration on Primary Health Care, participation has been a central theme of health policy and programming. The 2008 World Health Report re-emphasizes the values of community participation to achieve ""people-centred"" health systems [1] . Health service users are increasingly seen as citizens who should be allowed to voice their concerns actively, to shape health services and policies in the public interest and hold health providers and policymakers accountable [2, 3] . The expectations of this form of accountability referred to as social accountability are high, in particular in countries where health systems face persistent service delivery failures [4] . In many low-and-middle-income countries, health facility committees (HFC) are one of the well-known vehicles for community participation. They are involved in the comanagement of primary public health facilities, in the spirit of the Bamako Initiative that was launched in 1987 (see Table 1 ). While the Alma-Ata Declaration expressed the key principles of Primary Health Care, the Bamako Initiative operationalized the principle of community participation in the organisation of health services. It introduced measures that aimed to give users, through representatives in HFCs, say in determining access to services and the use of funds obtained through the sale of drugs. Some HFCs, especially in health centres with high utilisation rates, developed into structures with significant influence on the management of human, financial and material resources needed to provide quality of care [5] [6] [7] . In many countries, HFCs are attached to health centres and elected by community members to facilitate communication and feedback processes between health providers and citizens or users of health services. They, therefore, have the potential to ensure financial and social accountability of health providers to communities and to strengthen the democratic governance of health systems more generally [8] . Recent literature reviews on HFCs found that the extent to which HFCs in developing countries can influence service provision is mixed. This is due to the diversity in the composition of HFCs, their roles and responsibilities, the availability of resources, as well as the differences in health systems and policies, community and societal contexts in which HFCs operate [4, 9, 10] . These reviews led to a better conceptualization of contextual elements that influence HFC effectiveness, but they also called for more empirical tests of the frameworks. Based on a synthesis of findings from case studies in West and Central Africa, this paper explores the functioning of HFCs, in particular with regard to their actual and potential role in the facilitation of social accountability. A recent systematic review of the literature on community participation by George et al. revealed that most studies on the topic focus on participation in health promotion interventions and effects on service uptake and less on community involvement and empowerment in the governance of health services [11] . This paper aims to address this research gap and to provide recommendations as to how the role of HFCs in social accountability can be enhanced. The social accountability role of HFC Social accountability is a contested concept used in a variety of disciplines, including in the context of professional health education [12] , New Public Management [13] and participatory democracy [14] . In the health sector, social accountability is often viewed as an advanced form of community participation whereby citizens take action to enhance the accountability of politicians, policymakers and service providers. The role of HFCs in social accountability has rarely been assessed. HFCs are defined as ""any formally constituted structures with community representation that has an explicit link to a health facility and whose primary purpose is to enable community participation with the aims of improving health service provision and health outcomes"" [9] . HFCs can exist at several levels and take different forms from village level health committees to community health groups and hospital boards for district hospitals [4] . This study focuses on HFCs at the level of primary healthcare centres offering basic packages of healthcare. HFCs can perform two sets of activities to improve health service provision, presented in Table 2 as two roles. The first role is to support the functioning of health facilities and the objectives of health providers. HFCs serve as an extension of service providers and engage in community outreach, the co-management of health centre resources and the facilitation of repairs and fundraising. This role is quite prevalent in practices of HFCs in low-and-middle-income countries [10] . McCoy et al. refer to the activities under this role as facing ""inwardly"" [9] . The second role supports users' and citizens' voice and the ""bottom-up"" integration of community preferences in decision-making in service delivery. McCoy et al. call this the ""outward"" role [9] . HFCs activities include advocating for access to health care (""social leveller"") or resources (""advocacy""), the monitoring of the quality of care and the use of funds (""control of quality and management"") and the facilitation of feedback mechanisms between health providers and users (""provide accountability interface""). Whether or not, and how HFCs perform these roles varies, as HFCs are complex entities embedded in country-specific political, historical and health system contexts [9, 10] . Moreover, in many countries, HFC members work as unpaid volunteers; HFC effectiveness, then, depends on the personal commitment of individual members. • Improve the supply, management and use of essential drugs. • Ensure sustainable financing of primary health care units.Principles Decentralisation of decision-making to health districts and of financial management to communities; partial cost-recovery through the sale of essential drugs; sufficient funding for primary healthcare by governments; exemption policies for the poorest groups in society; health promotion and a multi-sectorial approach to health care. Source: Ridde [7] This paper explores the activities HFCs currently perform in providing a social accountability interface only (4th ""outward role"" in Table 2 ) that are summarised in four steps: information/data collection, dialogue/forum, consequences and counter-feedback to users [15] . In line with Bovens, HFCs provide a ""forum"" where they question health providers' behaviour and actions, and where health providers provide explanations or justifications; when such explanation or justification fails, consequences (sanctions or rewards) can follow [15] . We added the fourth step ""counter feedback to users and citizens"" as HFCs are representative of the communities in which they operate and have, themselves too, the obligation to report on their activities and results to the larger community. Apart from assessing the functioning of the accountability cycle in the study countries, we also aimed to explore the effect on health providers' responsiveness to community issues and demands and the factors that shape HFCs as social accountability interfaces. Figure 1 [4, 9, 15] . This framework supported the data collection and analysis. The four steps of the accountability cycle are expected to affect health provider responsiveness, an intermediary effect of social accountability initiatives [16] . Responsiveness broadly refers to the extent to which a health provider or health policymaker acts upon needs and demands expressed by users, the community or HFCs [16] . The ability of HFCs to influence provider responsiveness and service provision depends on several interacting factors related to the wider social, cultural, political and health system context and the local context regarding community and HFCs features [4, 9, 10, 15, 17] . In this study we were interested in one particular community feature: the presence of other interface structures such as community health workers or local councils. We assumed that other community groups, also those beyond the direct environment of health facilities, demand accountability and advocate for improvements in health services and hence influence the scope and reach of HFCs [18] . Based on the conceptual framework, the three main research questions of the study are: how is the accountability role of HFCs described in policies? How do HFCs currently facilitate social accountability? What factors shape the role of HFCs as facilitators of social accountability?Methods This article is based on findings from three country studies that were conducted in 2013 and 2014 in Benin, Guinea and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) [19] [20] [21] . The studies were initiated in the context of the French Muskoka Initiative with UNICEF WCARO that funds operational research in Francophone countries in West and Central Africa to support the emergence of innovative approaches to health systems development. The study adopted a qualitative case-study methodology to understand social accountability practices in selected primary health care settings within their real-life context [22] .Selection of study sites The countries were purposively selected; criteria included francophone countries, government commitment Source: adapted from [9, 15] to the Bamako Initiative, community participation and HFC development and long-term experience with HFC programmes. In each country, districts (department in Benin, zones de santé in DRC, prefectures in Guinea) were purposively sampled taking into account the presence of community participation support programmes. In Guinea, two prefectures were selected relatively close to the capital Conakry because of the Ebola epidemic that had not yet reached the capital at the time of the fieldwork. Within the districts, four health centres were selected based on their health performance. Based on suggestions by McCoy et al., we assumed that well-performing facilities could be associated with well-performing HFCs [9] . We used health performance indicators as selection criteria (external consultation, assisted deliveries and antenatal care coverage). Not all provinces disposed of performance data, therefore in some cases; the researchers depended on the knowledge of health authorities. The facility closest to the national capital was at 60 km (Guinea) and the most remote facility was at 220 km. from Kinshasa (DRC). Initially, each country team had selected four study HFCs; in Guinea, the dataset of one HFC got lost, totalling the total number of study sites at 11.Data collection and analysis In each country, a research team was set up consisting of a senior researcher, a researcher and research assistants. In Benin, the Belgian Technical Cooperation (BTC) participated in the design of the study. The overall study was coordinated by the Royal Tropical Institute (KIT). Senior researchers participated in the protocol and tool development and organised training for the research teams in their respective countries. Data collection took place between January and April 2014. Each country team had a backstopping advisor from KIT, who supported data collection, analysis and feedback on interim reports. An initial review of the health, decentralisation and community participation policies helped to understand the background of HFCs, the evolution of the Bamako Initiative and the formal arrangements about the role of HFCs in social accountability. Secondly, to investigate the practices of HFCs in facilitating social accountability, we used a mix of methods including semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions and document reviews, each with specific tools. Each of the tools addressed three main topics: (1) characteristics of the HFC and the health facility (local context), ( 2 ) examples of social accountability practices, and (3) participants' perceptions of the effectiveness of social accountability relations and practices. The triangulation of different sources of evidence to answer the same questions was expected to strengthen the validity of the findings [22] . For the interviews, we targeted participants at each health facility site representing health providers, local authorities, HFC members, community based associations and users (male and female) in order to collect a diversity of views on, and experiences with, the HFCs. A total of 95 individual interviews and 22 focus group discussions were held with different actors (see Table 3 ). The selection and recruitment process differed between the countries, depending on prevalent local procedures. In DRC, the health zone director communicated to the HFC chairman who selected participants based on criteria and numbers set by the researchers. In Guinea, a site visit prior to data collection supported the identification of participants and the issuance of formal invitations through the local authorities. In Benin, the identification and recruitment of participants was done by the HFC chairmen, based on the selection criteria provided by the researchers. Some documents were collected locally including minutes of HFC meetings and health facility reports. Not all HFCs disposed of written material. All individual interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed in Word. The transcripts of interviews held in local languages, were translated into French. Coding was done based on a coding guide developed jointly by the three research teams based on the conceptual framework and research questions. The coding was done through software Atlas-ti in Benin and the DRC and in Guinea in Microsoft Excel. The country research teams carried out the analysis and triangulation of countrylevel data. Each HFC was described as an individual case during a workshop in June 2014 where the researchers also jointly identified the first common patterns in the findings. This paper is based on a qualitative cross-case synthesis [23] that considered the findings of the country studies collectively and aimed to identify, from 11 case studies, common patterns and trends in the way HFCs perform a social accountability interface role. Authors synthesised this data from all three countries on the basis of the country research reports, the initial joint synthesis and their access to the primary data. The activities that are performed by HFCs as accountability interfaces were selected for inclusion in this paper based on a review of their clarity in describing the activity and its effect and on the basis of data (respondent) and data source triangulation. At least two groups out of four participant groups needed to have contributed to the example or the example needed to be confirmed by documentary evidence. Data about contextual factors were derived from the country reports but also by returning to the original data. To identify patterns across the countries and to include the relevant data in this analysis, a regular return to data was needed as well as some re-coding, in particular of contextual factors. Hence, the analysis was an iterative process of explanation building as proposed by Yin [22] . Investigator triangulation and team discussions contributed to the interpretation of themes and the identification of patterns across the cases, progressively leading to a better understanding and confidence in the synthesis findings [24] . Information on policy and legal country contexts was derived from previous outputs of the country studies and external literature. Regular validation of findings between the main author and the country research teams was done to ensure the quality of the results.Results The first section describes the political and legal context and the evolution of health facility committees in the three countries. The second section discusses the interface role that HFCs currently play, and the last section discusses how contextual factors shape the accountability role of HFCs.Evolution of HFCs in policies in Benin, Guinea and DRC In Benin, Guinea and DRC, different types of health committees have been set up from 1979, first as local initiatives and later scaled up to other parts of the country. In all three settings, the health centre level is the lowest level that has an HFC. District or regional hospitals usually have advisory boards or boards of directors but they do not have as main task to enhance community involvement. Table 4 presents the key features of current HFCs attached to primary health care centres. The table shows that the three countries have HFCs of similar compositions. They all have community as well as health worker representatives, and around nine members who are elected for two to three years. Health worker representatives cannot be elected as board members or chairpersons but can act as secretaries. HFC compositions differ in that guidelines in Benin and Guinea prescribe the need to include representatives from different social groups, while in DRC community health workers form a large proportion of the membership. In the three countries, there is a clear policy commitment to community participation and reference is made to HFCs in many health sector strategies as well as health system strengthening plans. In Benin, community participation is considered a crosscutting issue and is integrated into different health policies and reform documents. Since the Bamako Initiative, several types of community structures have been installed; it  is the health facility management committee (COGECS) that is assessed in this study, further referred to as HFC. After the countrywide installation of HFCs from 1995, the Ministry of Health further defined the mandate and powers of the HFCs in 2004 and 2006. Bylaws stipulate that HFCs are involved in the monitoring of the budget formulation and execution, the management of user fees, and the establishment of drug inventories and orders. The texts specify that HFCs are to promote financial transparency of pricing policies and to prevent extortion of patients and illegal drug sales. They have to report health workers suspected of fund diversion or embezzlement to the authorities to enable disciplinary measures. HFCs are further supposed to contribute to conflict resolution between the community and health providers [25, 26] . The Ministry further suggests strengthening the ethical behaviour of health workers through the training of user associations [26] . For each of the different functions, a training manual exists with concrete suggestions for conflict management and financial control [27] . In Guinea, the Ministry of Health, in its National Health Development Plan (2004), envisions communities as owners of health facilities instead of clients. The Ministry envisions the development of formative supervision and participatory monitoring with communities to enhance the quality of primary health services [28] . HFCs are supposed to plan and monitor health services at health facility level. They also engage in supervision, including the checking of health workers' presence and quality of the reception of patients. The HFC training manual emphasises that supervision is meant to solve problems rather than to control or inspect [29] . HFCs are expected to ""maintain a continuous dialogue"" between health providers and the community to reduce conflicts and to transmit perceptions and expectations of the community to providers. Community participation policies in the health sector are increasingly aligned with the overall decentralisation policy that established local governments from 1988. This means that HFCs are now under the authority of local councils and are accountable to local councillors and the mayor. A governmentadopted training manual of 2011 reflects this set-up; it describes responsibilities of both HFCs and the health, political and administrative authorities [29] . After this study, the health system has undergone many changes as a result of the Ebola epidemic, whereby the role and mandate of HFCs are also being revisited. Community participation in DRC has been revitalised in 2000 as a result of a health sector review that observed continued high mortality and morbidity rates. The Ministry of Health proposed to transform the ineffective or nonexistent health management committees into multidisciplinary, multi-sectoral health development committees. The new HFCs are strongly associated with Community Health Workers (CHW) who play an important role in health care in the DRC in the context of a shortage of trained health professionals [30, 31] . Each village has a CHW representative in the HFC. The HFC manual lists a range of responsibilities for the HFCs including planning and monitoring of health activities in collaboration with health professionals [31] . The integration of this governance reform in other health-related policies is yet to be realised. The implementation of the new policy is uneven with some districts benefiting from NGO support and others not. The data presented here show that the policy framework of HFCs in the three countries has been revised in the last decade, approximately 15 years after the Bamako Initiative. This revision mostly concerned a more precise definition of the mandate and responsibilities of HFCs. In many countries, including in Benin and Guinea, the Bamako Initiative was initially interpreted as a cost recovery mechanism but the revisions in Benin and Guinea re-emphasize the role of communities in controlling the management of health facilities which includes not only financial control but also the monitoring of the quality of care [6] . The revision in DRC is more driven by a renewed commitment, in particular of external donors, to strengthen the position of community health workers (CHW) in primary health care. For the three countries, the central role assigned to HFCs in most official documents as well as training manuals is related to the role that we classify as the ""inward"" role to support the facility and health workers. Despite increased commitment in new bylaws and health policies to strengthen the ""outward"" role of facilitating social accountability, the researchers did not find specifications of the actual powers and tools for HFCs to take up this role. For example, in both Benin and Guinea, HFCs are expected to monitor health service delivery but ways to address, report or sanction poor service delivery, are not defined. When roles and powers of HFCs to hold health workers to account are only partially defined, it can be expected that many HFCs do not take up this role or develop an approach based on their own experience and practices. In the following, we will focus on these practices to facilitate social accountability according to the four steps of the accountability cycle presented in the framework.HFC practices in facilitating social accountability Table 5 provides a summary of the study findings with regard to activities carried out by HFCs within each of the accountability steps. A more detailed account of these steps is provided in the paragraphs that follow.Information and data collection HFCs collect information on the performance of the health facility in two ways: through direct observation, monitoring and supervision in health facilities and through users approaching HFC members. The first method, direct observation and supervision, is strongly related to the traditional role that HFCs have been attributed in the Bamako initiative. Although the three countries followed different paths in implementing the Bamako Initiative, the task of controlling drug management and the financial books at health facility level is key in most of the studied HFCs. An HFC chairman in Guinea illustrates the determination of many HFCs in this domain with regard to supervision of the delivery and management of drugs: ""We control workers' presence in the health centre and drug prices. We have achieved results such as compliance with drug prices. The health workers were planning to buy and sell the drugs and collecting money without involving us. We demanded our participation in the ordering and reception of the drugs and the deposit of amounts received from drug sales before signing any document"" (HFC chairman Guinea, HFCG1). Besides this core task, in many cases, HFC members are present in the health facility on a daily basis to monitor the quality of care. Through their interaction with patients, they collect and share information about the health services, but they do not document their interactions. A second way in which HFCs obtain data on health worker performance is through users and citizens approaching individual HFC members directly on the street or in other public spaces or during health information and communication sessions. The latter strategy is particularly prevalent in DRC, where HFC members (including CHW) are conducting home visits for sensitization and public health data collection purposes. Users and companions (who escort patients) use this opportunity to share their concerns about the performance of the health facility without explicitly being invited to. In Guinea, respondents give examples of individual HFC members treating complaints on the spot on a case-by-case basis. Table 6 presents the main issues brought forward by users to HFC members across the 11 cases, in order of importance and triangulated by data from users, health workers as well as HFC members. In none of the study sites, HFC members pro-actively seek users' opinions or ask people to share needs, demands, expectations or complaints about health services. Tools such as patient satisfaction forms are not in use or are not managed or accessed by HFCs. Some HFCs combine methods such as in a case in Guinea where members are present on a daily basis to monitor the quality of care, and to discuss directly with health providers in cases of poor performance. This active supervision is more likely to happen after a user complaint is received.Dialogue/forum and effect We identified two ways HFCs use to channel concerns and complaints to health providers. One is the direct pathway whereby health providers are contacted directly, mostly individually; the second is the use of HFC meetings to discuss issues. The responsiveness of health providers to these dialogues is also assessed.Individual dialogue Transmission of community concerns directly to providers occurs face-to-face or by telephone. Participants shared a number of examples whereby HFC members confront health providers immediately after having received a complaint (Benin, Guinea). An officer in charge of a health facility and a female participant in Benin stated for example: ""When they observe awkward behaviour, complaints from the village, they call me on the phone…and I go... So this is how they behave and … how they do their control…either by phone and I will come and check"" (OIC, Benin, HFCB3). ""There are no arguments between health workers and patients here, and if it is the case, the HFC intervenes. HFC members calm everyone, they manage the situation and peace returns"" (FGD women, Benin, HFCB3). Financial accessibility is a major problem for many patients in the three countries, especially in systems where patients have to pay before they are treated or where informal payments are widespread. Complaints about informal consultation fees and high drug prices are very common in the three countries as observed from the FGD with users and HFC members. HFCs seem to deal with these complaints in different ways. They facilitate access by convincing health workers to provide services by guaranteeing the payment, or by negotiating a credit system as the examples illustrate: ""On a Saturday we were working at the health centre, a mother brought a child with anaemia. She did not have much money so that the pharmacy did not want to give her a blood bag for the child. Members of the health committee, who noticed this, vouched for this woman and have promised to pay if the woman did not pay. The pharmacy gave her the blood bag and the child was transfused"" (FGD HFC members, DRC, HFCD4).Dialogue in HFC meetings Another way of addressing complaints regarding the quality of care that the HFC receives is through HFC meetings. From both interviews, FGD and minutes of HFC meetings, it was observed that HFCs regularly discuss two main issues: health worker behaviour and drug management. Behaviour concerned absenteeism, informal payments, inebriation and unfriendly treatment of patients. Service users in both DRC and Guinea mentioned they had reported absenteeism to the HFC and they were aware of the HFC having addressed the issue in their meetings. According to women in an FGD in DRC, this resulted in nurses being more quickly available in emergency cases and in Guinea the officer in charge has developed a publicly displayed table with staff working hours that is, according to both female users and the officer in charge, being respected. Some respondents in DRC explain that by openly discussing health worker behaviour during a HFC meeting, frustrations from both sides are shared and listened to and that this process helps to address poor behaviour, at least in the short term. There was one case in Benin where the good collaboration between HFC members and health workers even got its own proverb ""there is no problem"" (« Toukada mou léo») which refers to a mutual commitment to rectify problems and not let the oil stain. In Benin and Guinea, HFCs often prioritise drug pricing and related problems such as embezzlement or overcharging in their HFC meetings. Some HFCs meticulously collect health passes, drug prescriptions and patient bills and compare with similar bills and with official prices. When there is visible proof (e.g. written bills), and when verification is possible, HFCs bring a strong case to the table that health managers cannot ignore. In Benin, a facility manager explains the dilemma's this poses to him: ""When they [HFC] call me to come and check the bills at the dispensary…I must say that I try to save my were not for our vigilance, they would have locked someone. We were angry with them, we must defend the culprit"" (OIC, Benin, HFCB3). While the systematic collection of evidence to detect fraud is practised by some HFCs, the collection and transmission of evidence on non-financial matters (e.g. health worker absenteeism or behaviour) is less systematic in the study sites and seems to be acted upon on a case-by-case basis.Consequences and follow-up As suggested in the previous section, sometimes dialogue and on-site mediation between HFC members and health providers ease frustration. Explanations for behaviour, for example by the facility in charge, may reduce tensions and solve a case. In a number of instances, however, HFCs pursue their quest for change by introducing local enforcement methods or by involving district health authorities.Local regulation Strong levels of negotiation and local regulation and enforcement were observed in two sites. In one case in Benin, a HFC introduced regulations and sanctions to enforce health providers' financial accountability. These included the formal interdiction to sell parallel drugs using the health facility prescription orders or to sell drugs on credit without approval by the HFC. The HFC further decided that health workers who had issued false bills had to repay the debts to the health facility, which some of them have started doing. Finally, the HFC issued a warning that health workers who would fail to apply these rules would be transferred elsewhere. One HFC in DRC had appointed one member as complaint manager who had the task to followup the decisions made and actions identified during HFC meetings and to keep them on the agenda when the facility in charge failed to implement them. Although health providers in most sites appreciate the contributions of HFCs in co-management, they were less receptive of HFCs engaging in monitoring consultation payments and fraud detection. In Benin, an HFC member believed that providers ""can threaten to kill HFC members over too much scrutiny"".Involvement of district authorities Community demands or complaints often move up the hierarchy after having been discussed in the HFC meeting. In Guinea this process seems most formalised whereby the transmission of complaints follows a route from the communities to health posts to health facility managers and up to the district authorities, written down in the monthly monitoring reports: ""During some meetings, HFC members get to discuss populations' complaints. An example is a situation of a health post, which was debated even on the management board. The officer in charge did not get along very well with people because he came to work inebriated. This complaint was sent to the HFC and sent up to the communal council, the health facility and the District Health Team. The worker was eventually replaced"" (OIC, Guinea, HFCG2). Similar examples were reported In DRC, where poor health worker attitude was discussed by HFCs and reported to village chiefs or health authorities, first orally and then written: ""There was a health worker, who had a habit of overcharging services and who did not treat patients well. Several community members reported these complaints to members of the health committee. The committee spoke to the provider, who, instead of changing, continued to act in the same way. Finally, after several complaints, the health committee sent reports to Health Zone Management Office who sacked the health worker in question?"" (FGC HFC, DRC, HFCD1). ""Previously, there was a provider here at the health centre. He did not touch the patients, he used a pen to feel and inspect a patient. He did not use his hands like other providers. The people saw it and forwarded a complaint to the central office through the health committee and promised to report this attitude to higher instances or make a court case. This provider was transferred elsewhere"". (FGD men, DRC, HFCD1). In similar cases, however, the HFC has not been able to trigger sanctions: ""A recent complaint we received was about a vaccination officer who was often inebriated at work… we have repeatedly informed health officials verbally before writing a letter, but so far they have not found a solution…Because it is the State that affects its agents and we often mention in our reports, but in vain. The state must resolve the complaints because it is the state that affects workers in communities"". (HFC Chairman, Guinea, HFCG1) In the cases mentioned, the main result is a transfer of the health worker to another health facility or the dismissal of a health worker. One HFC in Benin took a different approach to deal with health workers overcharging patients. The HFC required health workers to pledge adherence to the jointly established price list for drugs and to accept the working conditions at the health facility. The pledging was done in front of the district health authority as to enforce the use of this agreement.Counter feedback to community The last step in the accountability cycle, counter feedback to the community, does not seem to be practised. When community members report complaints to members of the HFC, most of them indicate they do not know whether their concerns reach the providers. Hence, they do not know whether the HFC members are reactive themselves or whether it is just a lack of counter feedback to the community, even if the concerns have been treated. Some HFC members confirm that they do not report back to the community; instead, they expect users to see the achievements of the HFC when visiting the health facility.Factors shaping the role of HFCs in facilitating social accountability With regard to the wider context, the countries share similar policy and legal contexts whereby there is a political commitment to community participation and social accountability by HFCs but limited support and legitimisation through legal tools or practical guidelines. This may explain the observation that none of the HFCs studied applies the accountability cycle in a systematic (regular) or complete (all four steps) way. HFC members and others may not be aware of their role or not have the appropriate instruments and power to perform the role. On the other hand, the findings suggest that despite a disabling legal and political context, the HFCs in the study areas seem to use the limited space or develop the necessary approaches locally to facilitate social accountability. In the following section, we explore the factors that shape the potential of HFCs to provide an accountability interface. It is based on a comparative analysis of the 11 HFC cases presented in the country studies. It addressed three factors: the election and representation of HFCs, remuneration of HFC members and the presence of other interface structures.Mode of elections, composition, representation, leadership In all cases, HFCs were installed through an official event, but in none of the cases, HFCs were elected as anticipated in the regulations. Even in cases where elections had taken place in a transparent manner, resulting in an initial representation of different groups in the community, the composition changed soon after installation. Members who were not active or members who are believed to be incompetent or too old were soon replaced. In one HFC in Benin, for example, the Chairman replaced a treasurer deemed ""too uneducated"". In two other HFCs, a locally elected councillor took the place reserved for an NGO representative. Sometimes new members are added without a consultation or vote within the HFCs. As a consequence, sometime after the elections, the composition has changed significantly, and in practice, only the executive board (chairman, treasurer) is active. Hence, the mode of election does not seem to be the problem but the recomposition of HFCs that occurred in all cases post-election. In some cases, it led to internal oppositions and unsolvable tensions between members, for example in struggles over the treasurer function. These tensions were also observable during group interviews in the study sites in Benin and Guinea. In others, it led to individualism of members (Benin) and apathy. In two cases, HFC leadership seemed to mitigate these problems; a capable and active chairman or board who insist on actively engaging with the community and providers.Remuneration In all three countries, participants mentioned the lack of remuneration for HFC members as an obstacle to the proper functioning of HFCs. In the case of Guinea, however, where HFC members are not paid and where external technical and financial assistance was largely absent, HFCs had similar levels of activity like the ones in Benin that had been receiving support for some years. Participants explained this intrinsic motivation of HFC members as a result of long periods of conflict and health facility destruction in that particular area. They argued that citizens had developed a greater sense of responsibility to manage their affairs. In one site in DRC, HFC members developed their internal operation manual in the absence of government-provided guidelines and, instead of receiving institutionalised support, they received occasional voluntary contributions from communities or individual deputies.Community features: existence of multiple interfaces As suggested in the conceptual framework, the presence of other interface structures and in particular their credibility in the eyes of the users and citizens can also influence the use and effectiveness of HFCs as accountability channels. The study aimed to explore this by asking respondents about the presence and performance of other participatory structures. Although HFCs in the three countries are mentioned as the dominant formal structure providing ""the bridge"" between users and providers, other interface structures or persons play a similar role. In Benin, respondents mentioned a large variety of actors such as mutual health insurance associations, women's and youth associations, NGO's, and community health workers, but also village leaders and local administrators (""chef d'arrondissement""). In a health facility that had a passive HFC, it was the village council that received and managed complaints. Participants perceived community-based health insurance structures (""mutuelles de santé""), introduced in the 1990's, as potential strong negotiators but they cover only 5% of the population and hence might not represent the larger community. Participants also mentioned district level platforms in the context of performance-based financing as potential accountability facilitators. In Guinea, respondents cited the role of elected councillors in local government as well as prefects (government representatives). In Guinea, the HFCs operate synergistically with other local associations, local government and authorities. The democratic decentralisation process in Guinea, introduced since 1990, seems to have led to institutionalised forms of local decision making, as expressed in many examples given by respondents. They are part of larger government efforts to decentralise governance to the local level and act jointly with local governments, education committees, etc. to strengthen the democratic base. Respondents suggested that the strong formal link between HFCs and local government empowered the HFCs and enforced local decision-making. In DRC, respondents mentioned community health workers and village chiefs and in some areas religious leaders. There seems to be an overlap between HFCs and CHW; CHWs perform health interventions, and they constitute channels through which users share their problems and complaints, as they are members of HFCs. CHWs are generally better known as health workers than as HFCs members. Some respondents appreciated the direct effect that village chiefs could have on providers' behaviour because of their traditional and perennial authority, but they were less positive about the accountability of village chiefs to the community. Participants mentioned religious leaders as emerging actors in health, primarily used to transfer health messages from providers to the community because of their influence on the community. An HFC member expressed that, regardless of who plays an interface role, there is a need to have a structure like the HFC to bridge the interests of ""foreign"" health workers and local communities: ""If there are no health committees, providers can deviate, misbehave or destroy infrastructure because providers are foreigners, people from elsewhere who are assigned to the health centre and one day they will leave but the centre will remain. The committee consists of villagers who do not want the centre to be destroyed"" (FGD, HFC member, HFCD1). Although users recognise the need to have an interface structure, they explain that such an interface is only useful to them if they respond to a certain number of criteria. When respondents were asked to identify key characteristics of a ""good"" interface they mentioned the ability to show leadership and authority vis-a-vis providers; transparency in management and decision making; and the ability to accompany users in the facility. Women in Benin, in particular, emphasised this latter aspect by stating that HFCs main role should be to ""alleviate the pain and anger patients live with as a result of unfriendly treatment and poor services at health facilities"". If they fail to do so, they argued, users are even more inclined to avoid the health facility.Discussion Community participation for the purpose of accountability and improved health facility governance has not traditionally been a major component of health programs and evaluation studies. This study aimed to explore the role of Health Facility Committees (HFC) in providing a forum for social accountability in Benin, Guinea and DRC. The findings show that HFCs address access and quality failures in health service delivery through the reception of users' complaints and regular interaction with health facility managers and workers. The way in which HFCs collect, translate and present concerns and complaints to service providers is sometimes ad-hoc and informal but in some cases more or less institutionalised, for example through HFC meetings. In the absence of (known) formal guidelines or procedures, some HFCs have instituted forms of local regulation to address misbehaviour or fraud by health workers. Through such local dialogues and measures, some improvements are reported such as improved health worker presence, the availability of night shifts, and the display of drug prices. The HFCs in the three countries do not have the power to impose formal sanctions or rewards to health providers in cases of poor responsiveness. Some HFCs, therefore, appeal to the district health authorities enabling the activation of administrative accountability measures of the health system. HFCs then induced the transfer of poorly performing health workers. Although a transfer may not be considered a solution to the problem, it is a formal sanction in many health systems. From Bovens' perspective, we can conclude that most HFCs in our study offer a social accountability forum to assess, question and judge health worker actions and behaviour and to enforce change through linkages to authorities [15] . On the other hand, we saw that the first (data collection) and the last step (counter feedback to service users) of the accountability cycle are less practised and institutionalised. This seems a missed opportunity as service users stress the need to have a structure that represents them at the health centre that acts as a ""bridge"", mediator and advocate. Moreover, we saw that reporting to health authorities does not always lead to action; some cases of serious or repeated misbehaviour remain unaddressed by health authorities. Hence, there exists an accountability relation between HFCs and health providers, but its' functioning is variable and, although effective for some cases of poor performance, not always coherent, authoritative and inclusive [15] . The observation that many social accountability actions are informal and personal in nature is consistent with findings of other studies on the topic. Molyneux et al., for example, suggest that the use of personal relationships and social networks in social accountability is more common than the use of formally instituted mechanisms [4] . Also, the confused election and installation processes of HFCs whereby positions are recomposed is a phenomenon that occurs elsewhere and regularly in local management committees in West-Africa, not only in the health sector [32] . We saw that internal reshuffling of positions might lead to individualistic rather than collective or institutionalised social accountability processes. Many issues are dealt with by an individual HFC member, and even when handled collectively, a small group of HFC members may dominate the HFC agenda. Biased representativeness, combined with limited community consultation (step 1) may translate in HFCs receiving only a fraction of community concerns about the health centre. A similar point is made by Knippenberg et al. who found that in Benin, Guinea and Mali, the voice of marginalised groups is excluded in primary health care management because of elitism in HFCs [33] . The absence of a systemic and collectively agreed feedback procedure leaves additional opportunities for concerns and issues to be overlooked. Even when HFCs actively collect complaints, there are risks that the complaints get lost because of poor documentation [34, 35] . Also, a lack of arbitration and transparency in decision-making can lead to biased or unfair outcomes, in particular when health providers are themselves involved in the issue, when they dominate HFC decision making or when politicians or 'patrons' interfere with the judgment or sanctioning of health providers' performance [36, 37] . Some of these risks of biased processes and outcomes of social accountability may also apply to the HFCs in our study. We, however, recognise the tension Loewenson et al. describe between influential individuals having the leverage to engage with health providers and improve the quality of care and the simultaneous absence of the voice of more marginalised groups [38] . HFCs in this study operate within existing social, cultural and religious structures in their communities. Members often include school directors, teachers, village chiefs, religious leaders and in one case an ex-military officer, who each can draw on a form of authority and legitimacy in their interactions with health providers, even where health providers are HFC members. For example, the two HFCs who instituted forms of local regulation to call health workers to account were headed by school directors. Although power asymmetries may remain between communities or patients and health providers, they may be more balanced and less pronounced between ""elite"" community members and health providers. Furthermore, HFCs that have an ""elite"" composition may form alliances with health providers to lobby the health system and local government authorities. In their study on HFCs in Nigeria, Abimbola et al. argue that members with a high social or economic status are particularly important in contexts where HFCs receive little government or external support; they can bear the costs of participation and facilitate all the functions HFCs are expected to play [39] . The question remains how linkages and accountability relations between HFC representatives and communities, in particular, marginalised groups and women, can be ensured. The tension between representation and influence is likely to be present in other social structures such as women's groups, local governments or health insurance associations and is not limited to HFCs; it will remain an important point in future debates and research on the nature of collective action and power relations in social accountability.Practical implications The conceptual framework of this study provides a useful lens to identify barriers and opportunities for strengthening social accountability through HFCs. Our findings affirm the importance of HFCs for health service and system responsiveness and, therefore, support recent calls on governments to acknowledge HFCs in their policies and on funders and global policymakers to support HFCs' role in the governance of health systems [8] . It is clear that, to develop more coherent, authoritative and inclusive social accountability processes and achieve more equitable outcomes, actions at multiple levels and with multiple actors are required. HFCs need to be empowered through a more explicit mandate in the field of planning, monitoring and supervision of (clearly defined quality issues within) primary health service delivery. They need instruments to propose agreements, allow more systematic data collection and documentation and skills to engage in dialogue and feedback with health providers and other stakeholders. The consequences of a lack of responsiveness of health providers to HFC feedback need to be clearly defined. In a pilot project in Mali, for example, HFCs are empowered through a results-based contracting approach with health providers. Rather than relying on higher-level health authorities for follow-up and enforcement, HFCs have the possibility to attach predetermined rewards and sanctions to health provider performance [40] . Such contracting approach may increase the formalisation of roles and transparency of social accountability processes that is now often absent. Pilot initiatives with Community Scorecards involving HFCs in DRC have contributed to more inclusive interactions between communities and health providers [41] . Their validation, upscaling and embedding in the wider health system, however, requires more complex reforms. Social accountability relations are part of a larger governance landscape. HFCs as accountability forums will not be successful if they cannot leverage formal sources of power such as those within the administrative accountability system. This means that district health management teams need the institutional capacity, power and incentives to supervise health workers and follow up on community concerns and complaints. Decentralisation reforms and devolved budgets enable such capacity [41] . Also, formulations or revisions of community participation guidelines need to define HFCs position and complementarity vis-à-vis other interface structures, such as health insurance platforms in Benin, [42] , local governments in Guinea and CHWs in DRC. In DRC, CHWs are elected within their communities; as HFC members, they constitute an important channel for service users' voice. Hence, through the strengthening of HFCs, the organisation of CHWs and community voice can be strengthened and vice-versa [43] . This may not apply to contexts where CHWs are employed by the Ministry of Health (where they might be perceived more as health workers than as community representatives) or where they are not members of HFCs (having limited influence in formal community structures). Hence, HFCs should be conceptualised as one accountability forum amidst other structures that can perform similar or complementary roles, each according to their competencies, position (facility-based or external) and power. Furthermore, our findings suggest that HFCs can generate responsiveness and improved community-health centre linkages at the local level. But, as suggested elsewhere, is it not likely that HFCs engagement in local social accountability leads to the kinds of increases in human and financial resources and drugs needed for good quality of care [44] . Therefore, social accountability initiatives need to distinguish between different levels of responsibility and take into account providers' capacities and resources to respond to concerns and claims raised by HFCs. Initiatives also need to consider how accountability practices and procedures can be respectful of health providers' rights to transparent and fair feedback processes and consequences. Finally, a challenge in practice will be how to sustain social accountability practices through HFCs in the face of other pressing health and health system challenges. The Ebola epidemic in Guinea, for example, re-emphasizes the role of HFCs: that of health messengers and surveillance assistants. In DRC, policy discussions revolve around the need to develop more intersectoral committees to address the broader determinants of health. In the context of changing needs for community participation, HFCs will be asked or required to shift priorities and navigate their multiple roles. In such contexts, it will be important to reflect on ways in which feedback loops and accountability forums can be maintained at the local level to ensure that poor health worker practices are addressed and to promote people-centred health services.Strengths and limitations This study contributes to a further understanding of the potential of HFCs in strengthening health provider accountability and responsiveness. Although the findings present just a fraction of a whole range of practices and factors characterising the interaction between service users, HFCs and health providers in the study sites, they provide a synopsis of current practices and challenges of social accountability across three countries. In research synthesis, decisions are made on the most relevant aspects to cover. The team took such decisions iteratively with key moments of consultation between the researchers and the authors. The final set of themes covered in the paper, however, is more a subjective choice of the authors and therefore they may have disregarded important themes to the three country contexts. Furthermore, although coordination and quality assurance measures were in place, the country research teams worked in different contexts and with varying qualitative research experience that might have influenced the quality of the interviews, and the type of responses researchers got. Finally, because the initial research questions focused on the potential accountability role of HFCs and in interviews we inquired about examples of 'good' practice, there may be a bias in the results; the data provided more positive examples than expressions of dissatisfaction with HFC performance.Conclusions This qualitative study explores the ways in which HFCs in West and Central Africa facilitate social accountability in primary health care. The findings confirm that many barriers to the quality of daily service provision can be addressed at the frontline of service provision even if accountability relations are poorly defined in policies or operationalised in guidelines. The study concludes that policymakers and funders should recognise and further support the role of HFCs in promoting responsive health services. For HFCs to facilitate social accountability in an inclusive and sustainable way at the operational level, their mandate and powers in service monitoring need to be made more explicit, and they need instruments to facilitate a full accountability cycle, in particular regarding community consultation and feedback.Fig. 1 1 Fig. 1 Conceptual frameworkTable 1 1 The Bamako initiative Background The Bamako Initiative (BI) is a policy statement, adopted in 1987 by African health ministers in Bamako, Mali.

Results of our earlier studies suggest that rural Canadian hospitals have limited access to advanced imaging services and intensive care units and that patients are transferred over large distances. They also revealed significant geographical variations in rural services. In the absence of national standards, our studies raise questions about inequities in rural access to emergency services and the risks for citizens. Our goal is to build recommendations for improving services by mobilising stakeholders interested in rural emergency care. With help and full engagement of stakeholders, we will (1) identify solutions for improving quality and performance in rural EDs; (2) formulate and prioritise recommendations; (3)  transfer knowledge of the recommendations to rural EDs and support operationalisation and (4) assess knowledge transfer and explore further impacts of this participatory action research project. Methodology We will use a participatory action research approach. We will plan for a governance structure that includes all stakeholdersâ€™ representatives, so throughout this project, stakeholders are fully engaged at every step. Our sample will be 26 EDs in rural Quebec. We will conduct semistructured individual and focus group interviews with relevant and representative participants, including patients and citizens (estimated n=200). Interviews will be thematically analysed to extract potential solutions and other qualitative information. An expert panel (Â±15) will use an analysis grid to develop consensus recommendations from solutions suggested and will evaluate feasibility, impacts, costs, conditions for implementation and establish monitoring indicators. Recommendations will be transferred to stakeholders using tailored knowledge translation strategies (web platform, meetings and so on). Discussion and expected results This study will result in a comprehensive consensus list of feasible and highpriority recommendations enabling decision-makers in emergency care to implement improvements in rural emergency care in Quebec. Ethics and dissemination This protocol has been approved by the CSSS Alphonse-Desjardins research ethics committee (Project number: MP 2017-009). The qualitative material will be kept confidential and the data will be presented in a way that respects confidentiality. The dissemination plan for the study includes publications in scientific and professional journals. We will also use social media to disseminate our findings and activities such as communications in public conferences.IntroDuCtIon Providing high-quality emergency care in rural areas poses specific challenges that are understudied. Rural emergency departments (EDs) treat four million patients per year in Canada, representing 30% of all emergency consultations, while those living in rural areas are only 20% of the whole population. [1] [2] [3] Compared with urban populations, strengths and limitations of this study ► First research project to mobilise a diverse group of stakeholders to find solutions for improving care and services in Quebec rural emergency departments (EDs). ► Consensus on a comprehensive list of feasible and high-priority recommendations for improving the performance of Quebec rural EDs. ► Recommendations will be immediately applicable and we will explore their impact by evaluating and monitoring this knowledge mobilisation initiative. ► Participant selection not randomised but theoretically representative. ► Interviews and committee participation is timeconsuming and participants with busy schedules may decline participation or may not continue to the end of the study. Open Access rural populations are older, in poorer health and more at risk of injury. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Rural EDs represent an important safety net for rural populations, especially in contexts where there are few alternatives to hospital emergency services, many people are without a family doctor and recruiting and retaining physicians are difficult. 9 Our previous work showed that access to care and services varies from one part of Canada to another (rural/urban, rural/rural). 3 10 In fact, 74% of rural EDs in Quebec have 24/7 access to a general surgeon, intensive care unit and CT scans; elsewhere in the country, fewer than 20% of EDs have access to these services. 3 10 These variations in access to care suggest inequities in accessibility, quality and effectiveness of ED care and services across rural and urban EDs and raise questions about Canada's universal healthcare system. Moreover, in the past decade, a wave of centralisation of healthcare services has taken place, largely because of budgetary constraints and a shortage of medical personnel. This has led to a reduction of services in rural areas and the closure of several small community hospitals, contributing to the wide variations in practice observed today. 2 11 12 In the present context of growing needs and limited resources, policy-makers are reviewing emergency services and their place in the continuum of care. Policy-makers need evidence to inform their choices about allocation of emergency care and services for vulnerable populations in remote areas. 2 13 14 In 1997, the Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians made several recommendations about improving medical practice in rural EDs across the country. 15 However, the field of emergency medicine has evolved significantly over the past 15 years, 16 and an update of these recommendations that is based on recent evidence is needed. The Quebec Ministry of Health and Social Services (MSSS) published an ED management guide (Guide de gestion de l'urgence, 2000, updated 2006), 17 but it is clear that its use is not widespread in rural EDs. 16 In spite of appeals for change, there is thus an urgent need for standards for rural EDs that managers of these EDs can turn to. 2 12 13 The main objective of this innovative participatory action research project is therefore to address these practice variations and the absence of standards applied in the context of Quebec's rural EDs. In collaboration with more than 200 rural emergency stakeholders and citizens, we plan to coproduce recommendations for improving the performance of EDs that are both evidence-based and respectful of the constraints of real world concerns. We use the MSSS definition of performance which includes access, quality and optimisation dimensions. This definition is in accordance with the conceptual framework and the needs of the majority of the stakeholders of the research who are members of the Québec Health System. 18 Collaboration among stakeholders will identify promising interventions, especially in the continuum of care, based on best evidence and on best practices in similar situations. This process will bring existing solutions to light and adapt them to the realities of rural contexts, increasing likelihood of the implementation of the recommendations. We use the knowledge transfer (KT) framework developed by the National Public Health Institute of Québec, 19 which allows us to focus on the different steps from coproduction to use of knowledge. It also highlights the multiple KT strategies from dissemination to appropriation of knowledge. This framework justifies the participatory research approach used in this project and gives us guidelines to evaluate the KT process. Potential solutions for improving accessibility, quality and effectiveness of rural EDs Through our literature review and the results of our earlier research, the expertise of our multidisciplinary team and the experience of our partners, we have already identified the following solutions that could improve accessibility, quality and cost-effectiveness in rural emergency care and services: improvement of emergency prehospital care (eg, optimisation of transfers); use of new technologies (eg, telemedicine, Point of Care Ultrasound); optimal use of resources (eg, access to medical specialists and facilities); training (eg, simulation-based learning) and improved management procedures (eg, facilitating the implementation of the ED management guide ('Guide de gestion de l'urgence'); standardise databases for better measurement of quality indicators). These solutions will be proposed to participants of our study in order to validate the potential usefulness and applicability.Improving emergency prehospital care using remote monitoring The distances between tertiary care hospitals and rural residents limit their access to specialist services and facilities. Our data suggest that most rural EDs are more than 300 km from tertiary and secondary care trauma units and an average of 300 interhospital transfers are required per year in each rural ED. 3 16 The quality of emergency care in rural areas thus depends on the capacity to perform procedures locally and transfer patients who require it to the nearest referral centre after stabilising them. 20 21 This process must be both timely and safe. Interhospital transfers, however, are expensive and expose patients to complications (eg, road accidents). 22 23 Moreover, many patients who are in pain or have not been stabilised require a medical or nursing escort, which can cause staff shortages in the emergency room and is very expensive. 24 One promising solution is prehospital remote monitoring, whereby ambulance personnel and nurses can be supported from a distance. 25 training medical personnel Compared with emergency medicine professionals in urban areas, those in rural areas are proportionally less exposed to various medical situations, including managing trauma-related injuries 26 and other serious clinical conditions. In addition, according to our data, one-third of rural physicians have less than 5 years of 27 Simulation-based learning or clinical immersion programs are promising innovations in medical education that could meet the educational needs of rural emergency physicians. 28 29 Quality improvement through standardisation The use of care protocols or guidelines in treating some emergency conditions, such as sepsis, 30 strokes, 31 cardiovascular problems as well as trauma could improve the quality of care. 30 32 This would be a relevant and evidencebased approach to reducing practice variations. However, the actual use of care protocols in both rural and urban contexts and their respective impacts on patient-care and health are unknown.objECtIvEs The main objectives of this study are therefore to: 1. identify solutions for improving quality and performance in rural EDs by mobilising stakeholders (decision-makers, professionals, patients and citizens); 2. formulate and prioritise recommendations based on solutions identified; 3. transfer knowledge of recommendations to improve quality and performance in rural EDs and support the implementation of the recommendations and identified solutions; 4. assess KT and explore further impacts of the participatory action research project.MeThodology We chose to use a participatory action research approach for this multipronged project. 33 Our hypothesis is that this process of knowledge co-construction will facilitate implementation of the recommendations.selection of EDs and study participants Participating rural EDs will mostly be the same as in our earlier projects and represent 100% of Quebec rural EDs (n=26). Ongoing changes, including mergers, in the Quebec hospital system may slightly affect our selection criteria at the time of the study's onset. Briefly, these are hospitals that offer 24/7 emergency coverage, including inpatient beds and are situated in 'rural or small towns' according to the Statistics Canada's 34 definition (population more than 10 000 but density of less than 400 people per km 2 , population less than 10 000 but density of more than 400 people per km 2 or population less than 10 000 and density of less than 400 people per km 2 (we are revising as per changes in recent census)). Two principles will guide the recruitment of participants: participant's characteristics which are susceptible to give rise to different viewpoints (eg, years of experience, shift work, profession and so on) and data saturation. 35 Respect for representativity of the different types of EDs under study will take precedent over a statistically based representativity in recruiting all stakeholders. Patient/citizens selection will follow a research approach that emphasises public involvement. 36 For healthcare professionals, recruitment will focus on relevant professions/positions best suited to answer our ED specific questions: physicians, nurses, head nurses, administrators, diagnostic technicians, laboratory technicians, psychosocial professionals, prehospital emergency professionals. Local media and snowballing will be used for recruitment purposes. In addition, a 'champion' will be identified in each rural ED. The criteria for the recruitment of the champions go as follows: (1) the champions must be familiar with the ED and (2) they may occupy any function as long as they have good knowledge of the ED and its staff. The champion approach is often used in projects where the researchers are far away from the study site. Champions are people who know the culture of the site and its particular concerns. 37 38 They will collaborate with the research team throughout the project, especially as recruitment facilitators and knowledge brokers.DAtA CollECtIon objective 1: Mobilise stakeholders to propose solutions for improving quality and performance in rural eds In the first phase of the project, the multiple stakeholders will be invited to participate in semistructured focus groups 39 or individual interviews 40 to discuss potential solutions for improving accessibility, quality and effectiveness in rural EDs. The interview guide will address topics relating to the particularities of each rural region (eg, the health and social care services available, the current situation of emergency services, the roles of the various emergency professionals, potential solutions for improving services and barriers and facilitators to implementing these solutions). Interviews will be planned as follows: (1) ±40 individual interviews with decision makers at all levels or the health system: 'Ministère de la Santé et des Services sociaux (MSSS)', regional health and social care centres, local point of care; (2) ±4 focus groups (±7 participants each), one for each profession identified (physicians, nurses, prehospital emergency services, psychosocial care); (3) ±4 focus groups with patients and citizens, one for each of the following categories: patient committee members, mayors, community workers, concerned citizens. The number of interviews will be increased until data saturation is reached. They will be led by a research professional with experience in qualitative research and will be recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis of data using NVivo software will generate a coding tree (themes and subthemes) of Open Access solutions for improving performance in rural EDs. Qualitative information about these solutions (context, feasibility) will also be extracted. 41 The robustness and clarity of the categories will also be assessed through discussion with the research team. 42 We will provide the COREQ checklist for the reporting of qualitative studies with the manuscript that will present the qualitative results. objective 2: Formulate and prioritise recommendations based on solutions identified In the second phase of the project, the solutions identified through mobilising stakeholders (Objective 1) will be submitted to a panel of experts. This panel will formulate consensual recommendations based on the solutions extracted and will evaluate their feasibility, impacts, costs and conditions for their implementation. The expert panel (±12) will include members of the research team, academia, university hospitals, professional associations and colleges as well as our rural champions and partners. 43 Selection criteria will be based on peer recognition and individual credibility. This panel will also establish monitoring indicators for implementing the recommendations. A two-phase process will be used to establish the consensual recommendations. First, an anonymous by email process will be implemented and, second, a nominal faceto-face process will be used to generate those consensual recommendations. The anonymous by email process will use a multidimensional analysis grid that will be sent to the experts so that they will be able to evaluate each of the solutions identified in Phase 1 of the study. The data collection tool will contain a 5-point Likert scale used to rate the solutions and open-ended spaces to comment on each measure. They will assign a priority to each measure based on their assessment of (1) effectiveness, (2) security or negative externalities, (3) costs and (4) organisational impact (implementation). They will also be asked to comment on the conditions for its implementation and indicate relevant monitoring indicators. Finally, in order to compare solutions, the research team in collaboration with the expert panel will determine the weight of each criterion (eg, Efficiency 30%, Security 30%, Costs 20%, Organisational impact 20%). Data from this analysis grid will be used to guide discussions during the second face-to-face nominal process with the experts which will take place in person during a 2-day meeting. Through this nominal process, they will reach a consensus about the priority of the identified solutions and their feasibility, with help from a facilitator with expertise in consensus activities. The consensus recommendations (detailed descriptions, priority, feasibility, cost estimates and so on) will be compiled in a document that will be the main deliverable at this stage. The document will also mention other suggestions raised during Phase 1 but that were not part of the final consensus. objective 3: transfer recommendations to improve quality and performance in rural EDs and support their implementation In Phase 3, the consensus recommendations produced in Phase 2 will be presented to all stakeholders involved in Phases 1 and 2 and to others stakeholders from the EDs involved in the research. A variety of strategies will be implemented to connect with stakeholders and accompany them in understanding, adapting and, eventually, adopting the recommendations. The possible strategies (conferences, videoconferences, websites, social media, communities of practice and so on) will be defined according to the nature of the recommendations that emerge from the research process and through discussions with the stakeholders (our partners, site champions and so on). As researchers, we will have a key role in coproducing, presenting and adapting the knowledge. We will also support the reception, adoption and appropriation of knowledge by acting as a networking hub for participating EDs and members of our expert panel and by suggesting tools to implement some solutions. Our collaborators and coresearchers will all contribute to accompany the rural sites depending of the needs expressed in each case, in a spirit of fostering partnership between central and remote locations so that each can understand the situation of the others. This online survey will take place at the end of Phase 3 (Period 0) and then again 5 and 8 months later. This survey will also enable us to measure the extent of stakeholders' participation in the project and retention rates and to identify characteristics of sites that adopted (or not) some of the solutions and characteristics of the solutions that had the most impact. The second part of our evaluation will be an exploratory assessment of the impacts of the changes initiated. Given that adopting recommendations takes time, the real impact of resulting changes on the performance of EDs could occur later, perhaps outside the project timetable. However, we will conduct an exploratory quantitative analysis of the associations between adoption of the recommendations and performance measures in emergency using the indicators determined by the expert panel in Phase 2. These indicators will be based mostly on those of the MSSS, the 'Direction des soins urgents, de la traumatologie et du continuum clinique (DSUTCC)' and the Canadian Institute for Health Information as well as quality of care indicators proposed by Schull et al, 44 Open Access we validated in earlier studies. 45 Some of the recommendations (training, telemedicine and so on) may have an immediate impact on certain performance and quality of care indicators and these will be measured (eg, number of transfers, duration of transfers, treatment of specific conditions and so on).Discussion and expected results This study is based on a participatory action research approach that fosters the application of scientific knowledge in practice and management. 46 47 Our research should therefore result in relevant recommendations that are likely to be adopted. The recommendations resulting from this project could be added to a new version of the Quebec emergency management guide (MSSS, 2006) and piloted by the DSUTCC, which is one of the knowledge users in this study. The results are also eagerly awaited by other emergency medicine associations and representatives in other provinces. This research experience, involving large-scale mobilisation, will hopefully serve as a model for improving performance in all areas of our health and social care system. Finally, we will be contributing to the science of knowledge translation. We will document knowledge translation strategies that are effective in this context, which is currently a gap in the literature. 48Open Access practice experience and only 6% have had extra emergency medicine training-CCFP (EM) Canadian College of Family Medicine certification of special competency in emergency medicine) (total of 3 years postgraduate (MD) training) or Fellowship of the Royal College of Physicians specialty in emergency medicine (FRCP) (5 years postgraduate (MD) training). Rural physicians are requesting additional training.objective 4 : 4 Assess knowledge transfer and explore further impacts of the participatory action research project We will assess the KT and implementation in the targeted local sites with a questionnaire validated beforehand that uses a Likert scale followed by open questions. The survey will assess (1) knowledge of the recommendations;(2) implementation of solutions to address identified barriers and facilitators; (3) intention to adopt proposed solutions; (4) barriers and facilitators experienced on site by those implementing the recommendations and (5) satisfaction with the project/its relevance.which Fleet R, et al.

Community health programmes have been implemented in a variety of settings and have provided a range of services in both low-and higher-income countries. Whereas community health worker (CHW) programmes include disease prevention, treatment and health promotion activities, peer worker interventions tend to focus on providing emotional and moral support, advice and information, and targeted health education [3] [4] [5] . A common aim of peer health interventions is behaviour change and increased uptake of health services [6] [7] [8] . Health behaviour-and behaviour change-is influenced by social and peer group norms [9] . Peer interventions have, therefore, frequently emphasized the shared characteristics, similar life experiences and mutual understanding of peers and their groups, claiming that these aid communication and increase participation in programme activities [10] . It is the peers' experiential knowledge and target group representation-rather than formal training-that determine their suitability for peer-led programmes [11] . The results of peer-led health interventions have been mixed. A recent Cochrane review of 43 'lay health worker' programmes concluded that, while they seemed to be effective in increasing child and adult immunization, improving health in sufferers of lung infections and malaria, increasing breastfeeding and decreasing deaths in the elderly, the evidence for other successes was inconclusive [1] . Most reports of peer-led health programmes focus on their feasibility, cost-effectiveness and impact on health outcomes. Relatively few have considered how peer workers conceptualize, experience and give meaning to their role. Since a better understanding of programme implementation can help to explain outcomes [12] , we conducted a qualitative study with female facilitators involved in a community-based urban health intervention in slum areas of Mumbai. We wanted to explore their role perceptions and experiences as change agents in the community setting, and the broader question of how much the concepts behind peer-led interventions are manifest at community level.MethodContext The Society for Nutrition, Education and Health Action (SNEHA) is an Indian nongovernmental organization whose goal is to improve the health of women and children in Mumbai's urban slums. SNEHA collaborates in the City Initiative for Newborn Health (CINH), which works with public health care providers and users to improve maternal and newborn health in vulnerable communities. One component involves mobilizing community groups to stimulate improvements in maternity care in the home and to encourage appropriate use of health care services. The project's conceptual framework developed from action research conducted in Bolivia [13] , experiences in community mobilization in Nepal [14] and appreciative inquiry [15] . Appreciative inquiry builds on the existing strengths and achievements of individuals, groups and communities to encourage positive change in attitudes and behaviour. Its emphasis on participants' own perceptions, values and understanding of their situation may make it effective among underserved populations [16] . SNEHA's community mobilization intervention provided the context in which we conducted our research. The intervention was initiated in 2006 in 24 vulnerable slum areas across six municipal wards of Mumbai. Its effects on maternal and newborn health outcomes were evaluated in a clusterrandomized controlled trial. Twenty-four locally recruited female facilitators (called sakhis-literally 'female friend') were assigned to randomly allocated intervention clusters. The name was chosen by the facilitators to identify themselves to the local population. Their role was to establish and strengthen community groups and to facilitate participatory discussions and experience sharing on pregnancy, childbirth, postpartum care and newborn health (Figure 1 ). In this context, they were conceived of as both brokers of information and agents of change [17] . The conceptual basis of the intervention was a familiar one: an action research cycle or spiral in which women's groups begin by sharing their experiences, move on to an analysis of problems and achievements, augment their understanding of health issues through discussion and strategic involvement of 'experts', prioritize the issues they would like to address, design strategies to address them at a local level, share potential strategies with other community members, roll out their planned activities and evaluate their success (Figure 2 ). Sakhis were employed on a full-time basis and received a small fixed monthly salary. Recruitment criteria prioritized experiential knowledge and personal qualities over specialized skills and qualifications. Although sakhis had to be literate-preferably with 10 years of schooling-a willingness to learn and build leadership skills was also considered important. Only women were selected, with a preference for those who were married with children. As local residents, sakhis were expected to be familiar with the slum context and have rapport with community women. The nature of their work required acceptance by family members and a degree of autonomy to allow them to travel outside their communities. Sakhis attended a 12-day induction programme that included the basics of maternal and newborn health, talks by public health professionals, information gathering on the organization of slum communities (bastis), and discussions on local beliefs and practices during pregnancy, delivery and the postpartum period. It also incorporated knowledge-building sessions on group formation and dynamics, rapport-building and facilitation skills, reporting and documentation. Over the course of the intervention, they met weekly with project managers and each other in a rolling process of planning and review.Data collection and analysis The basic research design, literature review and analysis were guided by a medical anthropologist of UK origin (G.A.A.), who was based in Mumbai as a long-term member of the SNEHA project team. A local female translator/transcriber was integral to the research, participating in discussions with the SNEHA community mobilization team during data collection and analysis, and acting as a cultural broker between researcher and participants [18] . SNEHA programme staff and University College London academics reviewed and contributed to early drafts of this article. We conducted a series of focus groups with 23 sakhis (one sakhi left the project before data were collected), each comprising seven or eight participants. We then conducted semi-structured interviews with 12 sakhis purposively selected to ensure a range of sociodemographic characteristics and experience. We observed three women's group meetings and several sakhi weekly meetings, reviewed programme documentation and interviewed programme staff. Verbal consent was obtained after explaining our objectives and giving the sakhis assurances on confidentiality. The average duration of focus groups and interviews was just over an hour. After each activity, a verbatim transcription was made in English. We followed an iterative process, using findings from initial focus groups and interviews to inform subsequent lines of inquiry. A framework approach was used for analysis, whereby emerging themes were identified and categorized. Findings were validated through a feedback session with the sakhis and discussions with programme managers.Results We compiled a sakhi profile using selected sociodemographic indicators to compare with women from slum neighbourhoods. Twenty-one sakhis had between one and four children, and two were childless. Their mean age was 34 years. Only the two childless sakhis were not married. Half were Hindu, 6 Buddhist, 4 Muslim and 2 Catholic. All the sakhis lived in slum areas; 7 worked in their own neighbourhoods, whereas 16 worked in nearby slums. Sixteen owned their own homes. Seventeen Community-based health programmes had metered electricity, whereas 13 had their own water supply. Twenty only had access to common toilet facilities. Eighteen had completed up to 10 years of education, the remainder up to 13 years. With the exception of educational level (programme selection criteria required sakhis to have completed 10 years), these data were representative of the female slum population. We categorized the qualitative data from focus groups and interviews according to three emergent themes: routine activities, sakhi role perceptions, and role negotiation and credibility.Routine activities While the sakhis understood that the aim of the intervention was to improve 'the health of pregnant mothers and newborn infants', their role descriptions tended to centre on their routine activities. These included forming women's groups and hold-ing group meetings, which many perceived as a way of 'bringing women together' and enabling residents to 'know each other better'. All sakhis agreed, however, that the main purpose of meetings was to share local knowledge and experiences of pregnancy, childbirth and care-seeking behaviours: We  visiting residents' homes, establishing and maintaining good relationships with women, and offering them advice on issues that arose. They also described giving practical help, the most common of which were accompanying women to health facilities for treatment or to register for childbirth, and helping to obtain birth certificates and ration cards.Role perceptions While none of the sakhis considered themselves to be health educators, a minority noted that they were 'mostly required to give information'. Although most acknowledged that their level of health knowledge was limited to maternal and newborn health, we noted that community women approached them about a range of health problems: . we work for newborn infants and pregnant women .. If any other problem arises . malaria . some other illnesses . the women ask about those too! Well, we won't have full knowledge about those diseases . so we cannot provide any information about them. (Sakhi interview) Sakhis described their role as a resource for accessing information rather than a source of knowledge. When questions could not be resolved within the group, their responsibility was to seek information and relay it back to the community. As a result of the range of health issues that arose, additional training was conducted on mental health, domestic violence, malaria and HIV/AIDS. Central to the sakhis' role perception was the notion of 'being a friend' to community women. The name and its meaning (female friend) provided them with a collective and social identity. Conceptual and theoretical understandings of identity vary across academic disciplines, most significantly on whether it is a fixed internal phenomenon or is flexible and socially ascribed [19] . Here, we use 'identity' in the general sense that sakhis identified themselves through their collective name and that they associated certain cultural characteristics with that name [20] . Friendship was variously translated as treating women well, considering them as equals, listening to them and understanding their problems, and sharing their experiences: A sakhi is like a friend .. We try to understand their issues, and we also explain to them our own .. So, that's how it is, like a friend. (Sakhi interview) The sakhis perceived their friendships and interaction with community women on different levels. While a minority saw these more as a function of their role, others likened their relationships to 'that of a relative'. Some described how women often confided in them rather than their own family, community or other group members. For most sakhis, meaningful relationships with women were formed through friendship and by demonstrating a genuine concern for their well-being. This contrasted with the approach of workers from other organizations: They stay at the door, and do not engage in friendly conversation with the basti residents. We are not like that. We show an interest in their welfare and wellbeing and show willingness to give them the time to listen to their problems. That's how we've developed good friendships with the group members. (Sakhi interview) Sakhis made clear comparisons between themselves and women in their target groups. While they acknowledged individual differences in terms of caste, language, ethnicity and religion, they emphasized characteristics and experiences they had in common. For some, the most important characteristic was being a woman. As one pointed out: 'Whether Hindu or Muslim, these do not make any difference. Women are all alike, no?'Role negotiation and credibility We noted different ways in which sakhis negotiated their role from persuading women to join groups and participate in meetings to sharing experiences and discussing health issues. They frequently dealt Community-based health programmes with reservations from women who, for example, expected payment or medicines in return for attendance at meetings. Some mothers with older children, childless women or those who were not pregnant saw little benefit in attending meetings. Negotiation with these women involved explaining the value of their experience for others or that the knowledge acquired during group discussions could be used to advise on other family members' health: Most sakhis thought that the likelihood that women would accept their advice depended on a level of familiarity and trust. For some, the formation of friendship and strong relationships helped to convince women that they were acting in their best interests: Friendship comes first. If I try to talk to an unfamiliar person, they will not be able to accept what I say. Once the friendship becomes strong, then whatever we say, the women will think, 'No, she is right. Whatever she is saying is the truth, it is to my benefit'. (Sakhi interview) Sakhis used a variety of tools and strategies to negotiate health information. They often guided discussions using examples of their own experiences in combination with 'new' knowledge acquired through training. Many sakhis felt that picture cards (a set of locally adapted visual aids depicting common health problems affecting pregnant women, mothers and newborns) helped to illustrate health problems and appropriate care-seeking behaviours. However, they sometimes had difficulty persuading women about unsafe practices during pregnancy or after childbirth. This was especially true when the woman had not experienced problems despite practising the unsafe behaviour. In these cases, negoti-ation usually included acknowledging the woman's own understanding but also giving alternative explanations. For example, in the following extract, a sakhi recalled her experience with a woman who had associated heavy work during her pregnancy with a normal delivery: So, I even said to this woman, 'Fine, things went well with you. It is God's gift that all went well for you. But it is not that all will have the same good fortune'. I explained to her in the same way, 'That's fine, that you did more work, that's why your delivery was normal but at that time, you must also have eaten well, [taken] fruits and so on. You must have taken good care of yourself, or you must also have rested as much. That's why your delivery was normal'. (Sakhi interview) I We asked the sakhis about their perceptions of credibility. Some felt that age was relevant as older women in India generally command greater respect. Others said that having children allowed them to discuss their personal experiences. Individual qualities like friendship and perseverance were also important so that, 'if any sakhi comes along and builds a good relationship, then she too will get a good response'. Knowledge of health issues was another possibility, although younger sakhis placed more value on the knowledge of experienced women: In that group there is a woman. She has 3 children, 2 sons and a daughter, so she has a lot of knowledge! She told us in full detail, that, 'In my first delivery such-and-such happened. Then, I had gone to the village'. She narrates all her experiences in full detail. Then full 2 hours are spent in just that! She is the one who gives more information to the women! And then the discussions too go on well. (Sakhi interview) We noted other factors that may have contributed to the sakhis' credibility. Those who lived in different communities pointed out that new group members often thought they worked at health facilities. Picture cards also seemed to have a symbolic value, as they backed up the sakhis' health knowledge and training, and suggested that they belonged to a credible organization: Because of the cards, we have gained a lot! On seeing the cards, the people feel more .. If they initially had no interest, their interest grows in discussions. They feel that 'Yes, these sakhis must be coming from some credible place'. (Sakhi interview) Finally, sakhis reported a number of positive changes in their self-image as a result of participating in the intervention. Many described having initial doubts about their ability to learn new knowledge, gain the trust and respect of other women, and communicate clearly and confidently. In contrast, their present self-perceptions included feelings of increased confidence and self-esteem, greater autonomy in decision making and mobility, improved communication skills, greater knowledge of health issues and, to an extent, improved status in the home.Discussion We have explored perceptions of women health facilitators involved in a community-based peer health intervention in urban slum communities of Mumbai. These included routine activities, role perceptions, role negotiation and credibility. Central to the sakhis' role perceptions were friendship and familiar relationships with women. Negotiation was identified as a complex but integral aspect of their role, which also seemed to be influenced by their credibility. This study was conducted towards the end of the community mobilization intervention. We investigated the sakhis' present role perceptions and did not document how these may have developed with the evolution of the intervention. Although the sakhis participated in the design of intervention strategies, our research focused on their role in the community setting. Limitations during data col-lection included the possibility that the sakhis' responses were influenced by their unfamiliarity with members of the research team or from the desire to give us a good impression of their work (which could have been influenced by the fact that they were salaried). Neither can we fully discount the possibility that some responses were biased by recounting the contents of training rather than describing their personal experiences. To minimize this, we validated responses by cross-checking interview data and by observing the sakhis in their work. It is also important to acknowledge the existence of cultural differences between researchers, translator/transcriber, programme staff and sakhis, and their potential impact on the collection, interpretation and reporting of data. Translation and transcription are susceptible to misinterpretation, loss of meaning and the influence of the translator's own assumptions and values [18, 21, 22] . Qualitative researchers are also vulnerable to 'selective reporting' [23] . Therefore, ensuring the relevance of lines of inquiry prior to data collection and discussing findings with the different actors were key components of our research. Our study highlighted the multiple ways that peer facilitators perceived and enacted their roles: as community mobilizers, women's group facilitators, brokers of health information and friends. The sakhis' descriptions initially focused on their routine activities (forming groups, holding meetings and interacting with the community). However, role perceptions were influenced by notions of friendship and the importance of establishing positive relationships with community members. We found that sakhis negotiated their role on a number of levels, from forming friendships, through encouraging participation, to discussing health issues. Perceptions of peer credibility were ambiguous; sakhis were unsure of what form this might take, or whether it had any relevance. Finally, they said that their self-confidence, autonomy, communication, knowledge of health issues and social status had increased as a result of their participation in the intervention. Similar findings have been reported by other peer programmes [5, 24] .Community-based health programmes Research suggests that successful peer interventions involve meaningful relationships between peers and their groups [5] and that some peer health workers consider friendship an important aspect of their role [25] . Our findings support these assertions. Friendship was a central part of the sakhis' role perceptions in a number of ways. It informed their sense of identity, it was considered an important personal quality that was reflected in their attitude and behaviour, and sakhis defined their relationships with women in terms of friendship and familiarity. This was important, not least because they relied on relationships of trust to negotiate health issues: 'Only when they trust us, have faith in us, only then they will listen to us'. However, in some contexts, relationships and familiarity between peers and their groups might act as barriers to communication. For example, a peer-led HIV intervention in the UK reported that gay men were often unwilling to discuss sex with peer educators they already knew [26] . Understanding how peers negotiate new or innovative ideas is important for programme implementation. Few studies allow us to compare our experiences with those of other interventions. Patel et al. [27] identified several strategies used by adolescents during peer group discussions of HIVrelated risks and decision making. These included the justification of one's own opinions coupled with the elaboration of alternative opinions, the use of concrete examples from shared knowledge to relate these alternative opinions to the real world and the clarification of knowledge through further negotiation [27] . Our findings showed that similar strategies were used between sakhis and community women, although successful negotiation might also depend on peer relationships, direct experience of pregnancy and childbirth, and credibility. A number of theories have claimed that credible peers can influence health behaviour change. For example, social learning theory and diffusion of innovations theory assert that higher status and competence make peers credible, which, in turn, enhances their ability to influence other members of their peer group [24] . Others emphasize the socio-cultural similarities and common life experi-ences of peers [11, 28] . In our study, sakhis identified themselves with other slum women, implying that they did not have a higher status. However, our analysis suggested factors that may have differentiated them. One was the misperception by new group members that the sakhi worked at a health facility; others included being full-time salaried workers, their comparatively greater mobility, autonomy, confidence and communication skills. Finally, there seemed to be some value attached to their use of picture cards and visits by programme staff, which may have led community members to associate the sakhis with a credible programme or organization. The positive influence of such associations on peer credibility has been reported [29] . In addition, we propose that picture cards may carry a symbolic value that enhances the sakhis' source credibility, a concept developed by Hovland et al., among others, in which two primary components-the level of 'expertise' one is perceived to posses about a subject and the 'trustworthiness' and 'reliability' of an information source-influence listeners' perceptions of a communicator [30] [31] [32] . We propose that, in a context such as this, successful programme implementation requires peers to strike a balance between factors that align them with their peer groups and those that differentiate them. Clearly, this is an area that merits further research. Programme design requires the translation of broad conceptual understandings into locally implementable strategies. Within the health systems literature, the modification of programmes between plan and deed has been called 'street-level bureaucracy' [33] . Our findings suggest that, during the transition from planning to implementation, a localization of these broader understandings and long-term goals takes place, whereby community workers translate them into more concrete short-term strategies and activities that are relatively concept free. Within a programme that was heavily conceptually driven and whose implementers had been extensively involved in discussions about the nature of the intervention, it was noteworthy how much the sakhis focused on local exigencies over programme aims. We speculate that this tendency would be amplified under conditions of a large-scale rollout because of the reduced opportunity for charismatic leadership and intimacy among sakhis. We think that our findings have five major implications for health programming that involves peer workers. (i) Programme managers need to reflect on the nature of relationships between peer workers and their groups and how these may enhance (or hinder) the implementation of programme strategies. (ii) Programme staff can benefit from understanding the role perceptions of peer leaders and should also consider the perceptions and expectations of intervention recipients. Clarification of misperceptions-especially in situations of changing peer group membership-may lead to greater acceptance and participation by target groups. (iii) The conceptual frameworks for community-based programmes should be based on empirical (street level) evidence as well as theory. (iv) Organizers of peer training programmes should emphasize rapport-building, communication and negotiation skills. (v) Programme managers should consider the ways in which credibility may be constructed, in the recruitment, training and supervision of peer workers.Fig. 1 . 1 Fig. 1.

Health services engaging Aboriginal communities in designing and delivering healthcare is one way to tackle the issue. This paper presents findings from evaluating a unique strategy of community engagement between local Aboriginal people and health providers across five districts in Perth, Western Australia. Local Aboriginal community members formed District Aboriginal Health Action Groups (DAHAGs) to collaborate with health providers in designing culturally-responsive healthcare. The purpose of the strategy was to improve local health service delivery for Aboriginal Australians. Methods: The evaluation aimed to identify whether the Aboriginal community considered the community engagement strategy effective in identifying their health service needs, translating them to action by local health services and increasing their trust in these health services. Participants were recruited using purposive sampling. Qualitative data was collected from Aboriginal participants and health service providers using semi-structured interviews or yarning circles that were recorded, transcribed and independently analysed by two senior non-Aboriginal researchers. Responses were coded for key themes, further analysed for similarities and differences between districts and cross-checked by the senior lead Aboriginal researcher to avoid bias and establish reliability in interpreting the data. Three ethics committees approved conducting the evaluation. Results: Findings from 60 participants suggested the engagement process was effective: it was driven and owned by the Aboriginal community, captured a broad range of views and increased Aboriginal community participation in decisions about their healthcare. It built community capacity through regular community forums and established DAHAGs comprising local Aboriginal community members and health service representatives who met quarterly and were supported by the Aboriginal Health Team at the local Population Health Unit. Participants reported health services improved in community and hospital settings, leading to increased access and trust in local health services. Conclusion: The evaluation concluded that this process of actively engaging the Aboriginal community in decisions about their health care was a key element in improving local health services, increasing Aboriginal people's trust and access to care.","Background Different morbidity and mortality rates between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians have been well documented and persist despite dedicated government funding over the years to address the issue [1, 2] . In this paper, the term Aboriginal will be used to describe the local Indigenous population which is the preferred terminology used by the Western Australian (WA) Department of Health [3] . Life expectancy amongst Aboriginal Australians is around 10 years less compared to other Australians [4] . This disparity is the result of a range of complex causes, including the transgenerational negative effects of colonisation, dispossession and racism, and socioeconomic factors resulting from lower levels of education and employment, and higher rates of incarceration [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Aboriginal people can face many challenges when accessing mainstream services. These include unwelcoming hospital settings, lack of transport, mistrust of mainstream health care, a sense of alienation, and inflexible treatment options. This has resulted in an overall reluctance to attend services [10] . Research has also indicated that poor communication from health providers and lack of Aboriginal staff at health services exacerbates the problem [11, 12] . To resolve this, health services need to commit to developing respectful partnerships with local Aboriginal communities and increase the capacity of services to be more responsive to Aboriginal people's requirements [13, 14] . In order to improve Aboriginal health and life expectancy, the Council of Australian Governments' (COAG) agreed to the following funded National Partnership Agreements (NPA) [15] in 2008: 1) Closing the Gap (CtG) in Indigenous Health Outcomes and 2) Indigenous Early Childhood Development (IECD). A core function of the NPA was to build partnerships between government, service providers and local Aboriginal communities. The expected outcomes were to increase coordination between health service providers and to enhance health service access for Aboriginal people. A key element to achieve this is effective engagement with the Aboriginal community. Community engagement has been variously described. Depending on the context it can mean consultation, communication, education, participation, partnership, collaboration and empowerment [16] . Involving the Aboriginal community in the decision making process requires partnership development and capacity building [17] . In a Queensland study [18] , enablers and barriers to engaging Aboriginal people in a health promotion program were elucidated. Enabling factors included recognising the importance of local Aboriginal knowledge and cultural traditions, becoming familiar with the local Aboriginal community, and developing a local leadership network. These factors not only helped to build trust and gain acceptance but were necessary before implementing any interventions. The success of community engagement also relies on whether Aboriginal community members see benefits that outweigh the time-cost of participation [19] . Barriers included the negative impact of past interactions with health professionals, a narrow concept of health, and a lack of understanding of cultural differences [18] . Effective engagement with local Aboriginal communities as integral to improving Aboriginal health and increasing access to services was recognised by a metropolitan health service in the Department of Health, Western Australia. The Aboriginal Health Team (AHT) at the Population Health Unit (PHU) of the South Metropolitan Health Service (SMHS) in Perth had established and built strong relationships with local Aboriginal communities over recent years. The process was enhanced by the aforementioned Council of Australian Governments' (COAG) funding for Aboriginal health. This funding was used to provide a range of local Aboriginal health initiatives, including the employment of Aboriginal health liaison officers at local hospitals (CtG), a communitybased Aboriginal diabetes education and podiatry program (CtG) and an Aboriginal maternity program (IECD). To ensure progress was being made, the SMHS was keen to evaluate the outcome of the community engagement process. Curtin University in Perth was awarded the contract to conduct the evaluation from a competitive tender process. This took place three years after the community engagement strategy was initially implemented. This paper responds to calls in the literature [20, 21] to evaluate interventions for their effectiveness in improving healthcare for Aboriginal people and presents findings from the community engagement evaluation conducted by Curtin University [22] The objectives of the evaluation were to identify whether the community engagement process captured a range of community views on health service requirements and met Aboriginal participants' expectations; whether those views were translated into actions by local health services, and whether Aboriginal people's trust or confidence in health services changed as a result. The paper explains how the evaluation was conducted and provides evidence of critical success factors in engaging local Aboriginal communities and health providers. It also explores participants' understanding of community engagement and offers suggestions for how community engagement can be sustained.MethodsSetting Perth is the fourth most populous city in Australia. This study pertains to the southern region of the city. The SMHS is divided into five health districts: Armadale, Bentley, Fremantle, Rockingham-Kwinana and Peel (Mandurah). Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Census data show that in 2011, the resident population of SMHS was 867,371, of whom 15,317 were Aboriginal, accounting for 1.8 % of the population [23] . The Aboriginal population is dispersed across the five health districts, which has a total catchment area of almost 5000 km 2 .Initiating the community engagement process Since 2008, the AHT at the SMHS PHU has actively engaged local Aboriginal people in improving their healthcare and driving the process of change. The AHT is made up predominantly of Aboriginal staff members with connections to the local Noongar Aboriginal community of the south-west of WA and other WA Aboriginal communities to the north. The staff bring many years of experience in health, including nursing, diabetes education and skills in chronic disease management and service delivery. In addition to cultural heritage, some staff members also have experience from a range of other sectors including housing, local government and child protection. This further enhances a holistic and social determinants approach to community engagement. The AHT bring an Aboriginal standpoint [24] to their lived experience and an understanding of Aboriginal ontology (ways of being), epistemology (ways of knowing) and axiology (ways of doing) in a contemporary Australian setting [25] . Prior to receiving COAG funding, community consultations were conducted to identify key health areas of concern for the Aboriginal community. Forums were held with up to 80 Aboriginal people attending areawide gatherings. As part of the community, the AHT was well placed to engage with community members and elders, and was cognisant of the range of historical factors that led to Aboriginal people's mistrust of mainstream health services. The staff acknowledged and respected the community's apprehension and guarded replies to requests for further consultation about health care. Their approach to engaging the community focused on strengthening existing relationships and building the community's trust through transparent communication. This involved sharing, reviewing and exchanging information with the community, and using community feedback to improve practice; an approach that continues today. In order to inform a SMHS Aboriginal Health Plan [26] and as a consequence of COAG funding being made available for Aboriginal health, five area-wide planning forums were undertaken between August and October 2009. The AHT coordinated and brought together local Aboriginal people, Aboriginal communitycontrolled health services, representatives from the Department of Health Western Australia, public hospitals, mental health, community health services in SMHS, and Divisions of General Practice. The aims were to identify areas of health need that could be funded through the COAG process; to inform ways to make health services more culturally secure and accessible; and to build relationships between service providers and the local Aboriginal community. An outcome of these forums that was was the establishment of five District Aboriginal Health Action Groups (DAHAGs) in 2010 that were based on action rather than simply consultation, and were located within the organisational structure of the Department of Health in Western Australia (see Fig. 1 ). Fig. 1 District Aboriginal Health Action Groups organised within the Western Australian Department of Health structure. ↔ Two way arrow shows the communication pathways. Community membership was essential at the local and area-wide levels. There was Aboriginal representation at each level, whether as community members or as Aboriginal staff members Each of the five south metropolitan districts formed a DAHAG. The DAHAGs met quarterly and comprised local community members (up to 10 per district), health service providers and an AHT representative from the PHU. Aboriginal community members were nominated by their peers and invited to sit on the DAHAGs for a two year term. The PHU arranged for governance training to be given on meeting procedures and chairing of meetings to community DAHAG members, in order to build their capacity. Community members were chosen as chairpersons. Each DAHAG had terms of reference, and agendas were set quarterly. At the meetings, members discussed health issues with mainstream and Aboriginal-specific health service providers who reported on progress in improving healthcare. Beyond the meetings, health service providers were responsible for implementing recommendations from the DAHAGs to improve health service delivery for Aboriginal people. DAHAG community members were expected to disseminate information to their networks. Notably, community members were compensated for their time. An overarching Area Aboriginal Health Action Group (AAHAG) was established to oversee program implementation and health service changes. Two Aboriginal community members from each DAHAG were nominated to attend the AAHAG meetings. Key objectives of the DAHAG process were to move beyond talk to action; avoid tokenism; identify local solutions to local Aboriginal health priorities; identify and action ways to deliver tailored Aboriginal health services; increase health service access for Aboriginal patients and improve coordination between local health services. DAHAGs were also involved in designing and monitoring local programs rolled out with the COAG CtG and IECD funding. Health service providers were tasked with committing to working in partnership with Aboriginal communities, to listen to their concerns and act on appropriate recommendations to effect change.Evaluation design Qualitative methods used to gather data and gain insight into Aboriginal people's experiences of the community engagement process are particularly useful when exploring the impact of social context in people's lives [27] . In an Indigenous context, the evaluation team was particularly conscious of the work of Maori researcher, Linda Tuhiwai Smith [28] who has advocated for research with Indigenous people to include and value Indigenous knowledge and experience. Tuhiwai Smith argued that in the past, research has applied a white, colonial lens that has disregarded Indigenous experience, values, ways of knowing, and participation. To avoid replicating past research processes that have negatively impacted on Aboriginal people's wellbeing, the evaluation team aimed to be collaborative, inclusive and respectful of Aboriginal ways. This approach takes into account differences in world views and the expectations that each party brings to the evaluation relationship [29] . It therefore becomes important in the evaluation process to ensure that there is 'a shared understanding … between the evaluators and the Aboriginal participants about the aims and methods of the evaluation' ( [29] , p.47). The evaluation team was led by a senior Aboriginal researcher (DB) and five non-Aboriginal researchers. The team brought considerable experience in Aboriginal health and community research to the project. The Aboriginal project leader ensured the cultural integrity and safety of the evaluation by overseeing the data collection and analysis. This included regular ongoing discussions with the evaluation team and the AHT on recruiting participants, the evaluation design and interview questions, conducting interviews and organising the yarning circles, and thematic analysis and data interpretation guided by Aboriginal research methods [30] . The project leader also informed the community of progress which involved two team presentations that included disseminating findings and inviting feedback. These presentations were held at two AAHAG meetings attended by community DAHAG representatives from each district and health professionals. This inclusive and collaborative approach between the evaluation team, the AHT and the community ensured the research process was transparent and culturally appropriate. Ethics approval for the evaluation was granted by the Western Australian Aboriginal Health Ethics Committee, the South Metropolitan Health Service Human Research Ethics Committee and the Human Research Ethics Committee at Curtin University.Recruiting participants Participants were recruited using both purposive and selective sampling. In consultation with the AHT, prospective participants were identified and recommended through extensive community networks. The evaluation team contacted Aboriginal participants identified by the AHT by phone, email or by attending DAHAG meetings. Participants then identified other people to contact which led to a snowballing process of recruitment. The evaluation team recruited participants in all five districts from the four stakeholder groups: 1) Aboriginal DAHAG members who accessed mainstream and Aboriginal health services but were not service providers; 2) Health Providers of Aboriginal Services (HPAS), including Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal professionals who catered mainly for Aboriginal people; 3) Aboriginal Specific Service Users (ASSU) who were local Aboriginal people but were not DAHAG members, and 4) Mainstream Health Service Providers (MHSP) who worked in services that engaged in the DAHAG process. Evaluation team members attended DAHAG meetings in each district to recruit Aboriginal community members. At these meetings, the team introduced and explained the purpose of the evaluation and handed out an expression of interest form for members to complete with their contact details, which were collected at the conclusion of the meeting. The evaluation team followed up potential participants by phone or email to arrange an interview time. Participants were provided with an information sheet that included the purpose of the evaluation, confidentiality assurances, the nature of their involvement and option to withdraw at any time without implications. All participants signed a consent form.Data collection There were two main forms of data collection: one-onone interviews and a culturally-appropriate form of group discussion known as a yarning circle. Yarning in research is defined as a conversation with a purpose and, in Aboriginal contexts, is similar to a semi-structured interview which applies narrative or storytelling in gathering information [30] . A recent publication has established yarning as a critical methodology in undertaking qualitative research with Indigenous communities that is culturally safe, yet maintains credibility and rigour [30] . Yarning in this evaluation was guided by the evaluation questions and began with 'social yarning' to develop rapport and a relationship with participants. This process then moved to exploring key issues related to the purpose of the research yarn. Four key evaluation questions were developed in collaboration with the AHT who also had input into the methodology used by the evaluation team. The questions were: 1. Was the engagement process undertaken by the SMHS AHT sufficiently broad and participative to capture a range of community views? 2. Did the engagement process meet the Aboriginal participants' expectations? 3. Were Aboriginal people's views effectively translated into actions by health services? 4. What changes (if any) in trust/confidence in health services have been experienced at a personal, family or community level? [22] (Additional file 1 provides supplementary questions that helped guide the evaluation).Data analysis Interviews and yarning circles were recorded, transcribed verbatim and independently analysed and coded using NVivo 9.2 software (http://www.qsrinternational.com/) by two senior non-Aboriginal researchers. Thematic analysis was applied to code the data according to key themes which were further analysed for similarities and differences across the five districts. Applying triangulation across the four stakeholder groups, themes were crosschecked by the senior Aboriginal lead researcher to avoid bias and establish the reliability of the data interpretation. Notably, participants were given the option to confirm the accuracy of the transcription prior to analysis. No participant was interviewed twice. Because the Aboriginal community in each of the five districts is relatively small, Aboriginal participants raised concerns about confidentiality, hence an important factor in this evaluation was protecting participant confidentiality. This was managed by aggregating data from interviews and yarning circles into specific groups and districts that were de-identified in quotes using acronyms and numbers for each group in each district; for example MHSP 5 is a mainstream health service provider from District 5 (see Table 1 ). Transcribed interviews were imported onto password protected computers and accessed only by the evaluation team. Data were categorised and coded through several iterations into key themes and sub-themes, identifying similarities and differences within and between participant groups noting any emerging patterns. In the initial stages of coding, two members of the evaluation team coded three interviews, compared category choices and coding for similarities and differences that were then discussed and modified. In order to add rigour and reliability to the analysis, findings were further discussed with the Project Leader and modified till consensus was reached. This process continued with the remaining interviews. An evaluation rubric was developed so evaluative judgements could be made that supported robust data collection, analysis and reporting [31] by demonstrating the strength of responses to questions (Table 2 ). Rubrics are useful for assessing performance [32] and in this instance the evaluators were looking for evidence that showed how well the community engagement process performed in engaging with the Aboriginal community.Results Sixty participants across the five districts participated in one-on-one interviews and yarning circles which were conducted in 2012. This included 30 DAHAG members, one HPAS and 12 ASSU, all of whom were Aboriginal whilst the 14 MHSP comprised both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal participants and three HPAS were non-Aboriginal. Thirty six people participated in the yarning circles and interviews were conducted with the remaining participants at a mutually convenient location (Table 3 ). Key themes indicated that participants in all groups (DAHAG, ASSU, HPAS and MHSP) felt that, despite challenges, the community engagement process was effective and working well (Tables 4 and 5 ). The community engagement process captured a range of views confirming that it was being driven and owned by the Aboriginal community whose needs were the focus of the process. Aboriginal people were included in decision making about their health care and, where possible, their views had influenced improvements to health services. Setting up the DAHAGs was a critical factor in the community engagement process. Responses from DAHAG members and ASSU indicated very strong evidence that the community engagement process was effective, demonstrated by Aboriginal people being actively involved in decision making and advocating for change. Despite initial scepticism, there was strong evidence that engagement between DAHAG members and health providers on decisions about Aboriginal people's health led to action and a commitment to improve health services, where possible. While responses were mixed about how representative of broad community views the engagement process was, the overall process nonetheless resulted in stronger relationships developing between community members and health services, improved health services that were more culturally appropriate, and increased access to and trust in services (Table 4 ). Responses from MHSP and HPAS also indicated very strong evidence that the consultation process was effective in influencing service providers to listen, value and be more responsive to Aboriginal people's concerns. This was demonstrated when health providers translated, where possible, community concerns into action by improving services so they were more flexible, welcoming and sensitive to Aboriginal culture (Table 5 ). The concept of community engagement was explored further to elicit a deeper understanding of its meaning.Participants' understanding of 'community engagement' Most DAHAG members discussed community engagement in interviews and yarning circles as bringing community together to talk about issues related to Aboriginal health and wellbeing: You have got everybody together and they are having their say and they know what is going on out there in their community, which before hasn't been happening (DAHAG 1). The meaning of community engagement for health providers of Aboriginal health services (HPAS) was slightly different: … my understanding of community engagement is … instead of someone or a group of people, me included, sitting somewhere and … coming up with our plan of what the services might be or what they might look like, to actually go to the community and ask them and have them participate with you in those discussions, so that is my understanding of it. … That is the difference. … Before, I wouldn't even have thought about doing that. It would have been … look at literature or look at other evidence and sort of plan without necessarily speaking to anyone directly that lives in whatever community we might be talking about. (HPAS 4) The above perspective of doing things differently was something that emerged from the DAHAG process and was a surprise for the participant who articulated this.   A mainstream health service provider added another perspective: Community engagement is having a two-way conversation that is respectful and that takes in the needs of the community and also best practices with the delivery … building trust … and making people feel welcome. (MHSP 3) The 'two-way conversation' took place at all DAHAG meetings. This respondent linked community engagement with best practice and the provision of a userfriendly and welcoming service for Aboriginal people.Regular meetings The quarterly DAHAG meetings offer a point of connection between urban Aboriginal communities and local health services, resulting in greater community representation and input into local health issues. Periodic whole-of-area community forums were also held on a six-monthly basis to consult with the broader Aboriginal community and to present progress on the Aboriginal health initiatives that were implemented as a consequence of the COAG CtG and IECD funding. The engagement process also enabled a coordinated response from the service providers in addressing Aboriginal health concerns at the local level: … the community consultations weren't just about the community. So that was the beauty of these DAHAGsthey engaged both the service providers and the community and brought them into the room at the same time. (MHSP 5) In the eyes of the service providers, bringing them together with the community and encouraging dialogue has made this process unique. Meeting and talking with the Aboriginal community on a regular basis was not something that they were accustomed to, so this process enabled them to establish and develop relationships and hear firsthand some of the issues that prevented Aboriginal people from accessing services.Action group instead of planning or reference groups The Aboriginal community wanted the name of the group to reflect its primary purpose of action and this was reflected in the DAHAG name: They didn't want to be called planning forums because they were sick of planning. They wanted to call them action groups because it was signifying we were trying to do something rather than just do more planning. (MHSP 2) Many participants discussed the value of increasing the capacity of DAHAGs by encouraging members to choose their representatives, which placed authority in the hands of the Aboriginal community. Participants talked about how this process shifted the decision making about community health issues to Aboriginal people rather than a top-down approach with health providers identifying the health issues. This approach led to health service providers changing practice and that was viewed as positive at the community level. Aboriginal people say they are most consulted people in the world, so I think we can definitely say, 'Yes, we have been consulted, but we have got an outcome from it and people will want to be consulted now because there has been action from it'. (HPAS 4) This comment reveals the participant's perception that when action results from 'talk' and leads to changes that improve services, trust in the process of engagement is developed. However, change was not universal; participants from one DAHAG group expressed frustration that service providers were not listening to them. The DAHAG process facilitated engagement and discussion between the community and health services. Key to the effectiveness of this process was health services being transparent about their limitations, such as the scarcity of resources to meet community expectations. Community expectations were managed through regular feedback and evidence of outcomes at each meeting.Aboriginal people making decisions about their healthcare The structure of the DAHAG supported Aboriginal governance and leadership by ensuring that the chairperson was a community member with the meeting agenda and priorities set by the community, thereby helping to create a culturally safe space. This empowered and built the confidence and capacity of the community to speak up about their needs and concerns in relation to healthcare. Participants referred to DAHAGs being cultural governance committees where community was responsible for selecting who represented them on the DAHAGs: Aboriginal people have been the consultants. When they have allowed Aboriginal people to go to Aboriginal people and identify the support they need through the programs that health can give to them, I think that has been able to bring a sense of ownership, bring a sense of Aboriginal people caring for one another, Aboriginal people making decisions for one another. So … that has been great that Aboriginal people are doing it. (DAHAG 2) There was a sense that power relations had shifted. The Aboriginal community became an active decision maker and Aboriginal DAHAG members made up the majority on the committees where 'there is definitely a real sense that the power balance is much more evened out' (MHSP 5). Another unique aspect of the community engagement process was how the AHT approached the Aboriginal community and encouraged them to think about their health needs through community forums prior to the development of the SMHS Aboriginal Health Plan. The process was done a different way, instead of having the funding first and then just saying, 'okay, this is the funding, these are our restrictions for the funding. How can we make it work for you?' It was 'if you had the funding what would you do with it? What is the best way? What programs do you want to see?' Needs were identified and then we built it on from that way and I think that is where the success of the DAHAG came from. (HPAS 4) This more innovative and inclusive approach enabled service providers to hear and respond to what people said they needed. This resulted in new or modified services that were more appropriate and tailored to Aboriginal needs, for example, in maternity care. And maybe that is because they have not worked with Aboriginal people before, but I think (midwife) has been open to learning as well… it is a two-way street, I think, and I appreciate that. I appreciate not being treated like a child and not being assumed to be …on my second marriage because I had so many children and, you know, just the attitude that they get. It may not be overt but the insinuations are there and you pick up on that. And I know with [midwife], she follows through. You don't see a different midwife every week or every time you go. (ASSU 1)Accountability Another unique aspect of the community engagement process was the establishment of accountability procedures, involving both community and health service providers. Two-way accountability, gaining respect from the community, keeping community engaged the whole time. Community were instrumental in how to go about the community engagement. (MHSP 2) Regular meetings facilitated continuity, follow up of issues and progress on actions. Looking at the engagement with the service providers and the DAHAG group, it has made it a lot more comfortable to speak up … Because I think ideally, we are sort of asked what we thought about certain things or how we would go about doing things … We help the different service providers, or give them ideas so that they can go away and look at some strategies. And with the service providers, they always come back to the DAHAG meetings, so you are getting updates, 'Okay, this worked and that didn't work'. (DAHAG 4) Accountability from health service providers was demonstrated when they reported back to the community on changes to health services following community recommendations made at DAHAG meetings, or on factors impeding change. DAHAG members were also accountable to the community they represented. This responsibility was twofold: not only to disseminate information on DAHAG business to the community, but also to feedback and discuss with health service providers any health concerns raised by the community. It is great to have community members ask questions about your service and it is good that they hold you accountable for what is happening, because without that process in place who knows how the money would be spent and whether the services would be done effectively. So [DAHAGs] are a governance not just for services, but for pretty much a lot of different planning and policies and services outside of health as well. (HPAS 4) Input from the community enabled service providers to tailor their services to meet Aboriginal people's needs, therefore increasing the likelihood that their services would be used. Attending regular meetings and receiving feedback from the Aboriginal community about their services provided reassurance that they were delivering what people wanted or expected.Discussion Findings suggest that overall, the community engagement process was broad enough to successfully capture a range of community perspectives and generally meet and sometimes exceed the expectations of those involved. Most participants agreed their views were heard and, when possible translated to action by health services, or, if not, reasons given about why this was not possible. Participants felt empowered to be actively involved in decisions about their health care, with training available in chairing and conducting DAHAG meetings with local health providers on how services could be designed and delivered to better meet Aboriginal people's needs. Findings also showed that, as a result of this process, particularly with the establishment of the DAHAGs, participants' confidence and trust were developing; this was seen as a welcome indicator that efforts were being made to improve services in light of Aboriginal people's concerns. The overall positive responses to the evaluation questions from the four stakeholder groups confirm the effectiveness of this community engagement approach. It is worth noting that most responses from all stakeholder groups indicated strong to very strong evidence of their approval of the community engagement process. However, responses in the 'mixed' category, while few, indicate room for improvement including strategies to facilitate a broader engagement with the community. Regular community forums provided a way to engage the broader Aboriginal community. DAHAG meetings were a successful way to build relationships between local Aboriginal people, the AHT and Aboriginal-specific and mainstream health services. The Aboriginal community and local health services were able to share knowledge and collaborate to improve health care and the experiences of Aboriginal people accessing these services. Current literature suggests that engagement and partnership with Aboriginal communities is integral to any health policy or intervention to improve care [13, 14] . However, successfully building such partnerships requires a shift from expecting Aboriginal patients to adapt to the expectations of the health service to the health service being more inclusive, collaborative and flexible in responding to the needs of Aboriginal people in ways that are respectful and more likely to build trust and strengthen relationships. Findings from the evaluation concur with literature which states that reciprocity or shared knowledge and understanding of Aboriginal health needs and recognising the importance of Aboriginal knowledge and culture can help establish and build intercultural partnerships [13, 14] . This evaluation supports other research revealing that as Aboriginal people become more involved in decision making about their health and healthcare, their confidence and sense of empowerment increase [33] . However, we suggest that empowerment requires a willingness to share and build on existing knowledge and skills. This two-way process involves Aboriginal communities learning about health services and the health system, and health services building their knowledge and skills about Aboriginal ways of working and Aboriginal culture. A mutual commitment to establishing and maintaining the partnership is a key factor in its success. This includes agreeing on the purpose of the partnership and instituting effective processes around governance such as conducting meetings, designing work plans and documenting activities [34] . The DAHAGs were instrumental in establishing a governance structure to facilitate this process. The capacity of local Aboriginal communities was also developed with the assistance of the PHU in relation to the recruitment and training of community members. From a service provider perspective, the innovative approach taken in this community engagement process shifted the power balance. From a top down model, where mainstream health services determined the care of Aboriginal people, to a grassroots model that encouraged the participation of the Aboriginal community. The DAHAGs became key players in identifying ways to improve the design and delivery of health services to better meet their needs. Health services that partner with an Aboriginal community to improve healthcare need to be transparent about what is possible in relation to health care. Failure to do this can compound past government and mainstream failures in addressing Aboriginal health, frustrating communities and sabotaging the community engagement process [19] . The majority of participants involved in the community engagement process commented on noticeable changes made by health service organisations in their area since it was initiated. Participants pointed out improvements in health service delivery at their local hospital and/or health agency. Most Aboriginal participants strongly supported the notion that consultation had led to action and that Aboriginal ownership was a feature of the DAHAG process. Local Aboriginal health programs, established with the support of the DAHAGs, have shown demonstrable success. Two have been the subject of recent publications. The first program (Moorditj Djena) provides access to culturally secure diabetes education and podiatry care for Aboriginal people in the SMHS and has been well utilised by the local community [35] . The second program (Aboriginal Maternity Group Practice) provides antenatal care for Aboriginal women living in the SMHS area and has shown a considerable increase in the proportion of Aboriginal women choosing to birth locally and significantly improved neonatal outcomes [36] . The DAHAGs were instrumental in the design and roll out of these programs. Moreover, these programs, as well as others, have provided increased employment opportunities for local Aboriginal people. The evaluation was limited by its focus on the small sample of participants. The evaluation team had asked participants if they could recommend other Aboriginal community members (non-DAHAG participants) or relevant stakeholders who had not participated in the community engagement process. The purpose was to gain as wide a range of perspectives as possible [37] . However, despite attempts of a team member to contact and follow up people by phone, recruiting Aboriginal people who had not participated in the community engagement process proved challenging. Thus, it remains unknown whether community members who chose not to participate in the community engagement process were unhappy with the process or did not engage for other reasons. However, given the number of Aboriginal people who accessed various services such as diabetes or maternity care, it appeared that awareness within the broader community was good. Aboriginal respondents speculated that information was disseminated via the 'grapevine' from DAHAG or community forum attendees. Hence, a non-participant would know who to ask for assistance about any health services queries. The evaluation team identified key concerns that need to be addressed if the process of community engagement is to be sustained. First, ongoing funding needs to build on and strengthen existing partnerships. Second, regular reviews to ensure adequate Aboriginal representation across the region are warranted. Third, ongoing capacity building for DAHAG members through training, support and mentoring is needed to build knowledge, skills and experience, and increase employment opportunities. Throughout the process the Curtin team was committed to working in partnership with the AHT to ensure that the evaluation process was respectful of the Aboriginal community. This was demonstrated by the team applying Indigenous methods to the evaluation process, providing regular feedback to the AHT, presenting findings to the community, and inviting feedback. While the community engagement process may be adapted to other locations, findings may be different in other metropolitan, rural, remote or international settings. However, evidence from this evaluation suggests that application of the principles of this approach are worthy of consideration in the design and implementation of community engagement processes in other settings.Conclusion The SMHS community engagement process demonstrated that actively engaging the Aboriginal community has been a key element in improving local health services for Aboriginal people. The formation of DAHAGs was a critical success factor in the engagement process and resulted in empowering the Aboriginal community to show leadership, drive the process, and communicate Aboriginal people's concerns about healthcare to service providers. Action, rather than just planning, was a key function of the group. Health service providers worked with DAHAG community members to improve the cultural security of their services. The feedback loop that was established fostered a sense of accountability, transparency and trust and has resulted in better healthcare for the Aboriginal community.I think that this process that happened in South Metro was exceptional. No other region undertook community engagement to the extent or even in a whisper of what South Metro did to get an understanding of what the community's needs are, what the community's wants were, and engage with them at all … and the service providers within the area.

Primary Care Trusts in England face the challenge of converting community participation in health into reality. This study explores differences in perception of participation between lay and professional stakeholders of a community health project for a South Asian population in Greater Manchester. Methods In-depth interviews and focus groups were used to explore the views of professional and lay stakeholders. All data were audio-taped, transcribed and analysed for emerging themes using a qualitative framework. Results Professionals talked of working in partnership with the community but lay stakeholders did not feel that they had control over the project. There were problems in engaging the community and local health professionals in the project. Lack of cultural awareness hampered participation in the project. There was agreement that the project improved the self-confidence of participants and created a more informed population. However, there was little support for claims of improvements in social cohesion and changes in lifestyle directly as a result of the project. Conclusion Converting the rhetoric of community participation in health into reality is a greater challenge than was envisaged by policy makers. Marginalized communities may not be willing participants and issues of language and cultural sensitivity are important. Project outcomes need to be agreed to ensure projects are evaluated appropriately. Projects with South Asian communities should not be seen to be dealing with all 'ethnic health' issues without addressing changes in statutory organizations and other wider social determinants of health.","Introduction The concept of community participation in health first appeared over three decades ago in the developing world as part of movement for social justice. 1 It was envisaged that basic health needs could be met more appropriately and efficiently by the greater involvement of people themselves. 2 Community empowerment is considered central to the process of participation, enabling people to have a greater say and more control over their own lives and local health care decisions. In working with marginalized communities, community participation could reduce health inequalities and improve equity. 3 In 1991, the World Health Organization 4 summarized the benefits of participation: (1) coverage -involves more people than non-participatory projects; (2) efficiency -promotes better co-ordination of resources; (3) effectiveness -goals and strategies are more relevant as a result of participation; (4) equity -promotes notion of providing for those in greatest need; (5) self reliance -increases people's control over their own lives. Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) in England are challenged with converting the rhetoric of community participation in health into reality, 5 yet the precise nature of participation remains elusive and little is know on the actual benefits of participation. 1, 6 As PCTs move from policy to implementation, local understanding of the concepts of participation and its associated health gain need to be explored in situ in order to ensure that rhetoric can translate into reality. The Asian Health Development Project (AHDP) was set up in a small town in Greater Manchester to access and respond to health needs of the local South Asian community. A 'community participation' approach was used to achieve 'potential health gain'. A number of initiatives were used to engage the community, including training programmes on health and health services, a diabetes awareness project with cookery classes, first aid courses and exercise classes. Many professionals from the PCT, Hospital Trust and the local authority were involved in these initiatives. This paper presents the findings of a study that explored the perceptions of participation and its associated health gain amongst lay and professional stakeholders of the AHDP.Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 13 professional stakeholders who had been involved in the project (project workers, managers, nurses, dieticians), exploring their perceptions of participation and health gain in the project. A nonprobabilistic maximum variation sampling strategy was used to provide multiple perspectives. Interviews were conducted by G.B. and lasted between 60 and 90 min. Questions were adapted to each interview but concentrated on the nature and extent of participation by the local community and the health benefits the community had gained as a result of the project. Three focus groups were conducted with each of the subgroups of the local South Asian community (Indian, n = 5; Pakistani, n = 5; and Bangladeshi, n = 4) exploring perceptions of participation and health gain in the project. All the participants were female (reflecting the gender of the majority of the participants of the project) and ranged in age from 25 to 46 years. The average length of focus groups was 90 min. To validate emerging themes from the focus groups, four in-depth interviews were conducted with lay informants using an opportunistic sampling strategy. All interviews and focus groups were audio-taped and transcribed verbatim. Analysis was carried out using a content analysis for emerging themes based on Denzin's Interpretive Interactionism framework. 7 Emerging themes were grouped into categories and are reported below.ResultsPerceptions of participation: partner or problem? Lay participants felt they had no control over the project or its resources and considered themselves as recipients of the project's work rather than active shapers or partners in the process. In contrast, professionals frequently described the project as a partnership, but made little reference to distribution of power in the project.Barriers to participation: engaging the community Lay participants recognized that many people did not want to, nor had the time to participate in the project. The project was not considered a priority compared with the other problems families had to deal with. Professionals spoke of the difficulty they had in getting people to attend events associated with the project. The project failed to engage the most deprived Bangladeshi section of the community and was seen by some as widening inequity in the local South Asian population.Barriers to participation: engaging health professionals Engaging health professionals was seen as equally problematic. Professionals admitted the project had been unsuccessful in involving local GPs over its 5-year duration. There was fear and uncertainty amongst professionals about methods that challenged traditional ways of working.Barriers to participation: language and cultural awareness Some professionals expressed reservations that community participation was not possible without good interpreting services. Others viewed participation as an empowering process (not simply about getting health messages through) that could overcome language and cultural barriers. Lay informants agreed that non-English speakers were less likely to participate in community projects. According to Professional D: 'Language is not a barrier to people participating . . . with mother tongue support, people are glad their language is spoken and therefore think information is accessible and are therefore able to participate.' Lay informants were frustrated by the lack of cultural awareness and sensitivity in the project. Others felt that some health professionals held stereotypical views of Asian women and made assumptions about beliefs and behaviour.Barriers to participation: time and resources Professionals working to short deadlines and used to more immediate results felt frustrated at the slow pace of change in participation projects. Others recognized that slow, steady progress was the only way to ensure reliable and sustainable results and to avoid 'quick fixes' that were not relevant. There was consensus amongst health professionals that community participation was not a cheap option and considerable resources were required by projects to achieve their potential and demonstrate cost-effectiveness. According to Professional I: 'You have got to have recurrent funding. . . you are competing with a lot of other priorities, so you have got to have a clearer idea about what your outcomes are and be able to show them.'Benefits of participation: a more informed population There was agreement between lay and professional informants that the project had raised awareness on health issues and services and created a more informed population. Community members felt they had learned a lot and some had moved onto further training and employment opportunities.Health impact of project: psychological benefits Lay informants felt more confident through participating in the project. Confidence was perceived to have improved through gaining knowledge and skills and making new friends. Professional informants felt the project had raised the self-esteem of those who participated. were optimistic about the project's impact, whilst others recognized the project's limitations in affecting the broader social determinants of health. Lay informants did not make the link between health knowledge gained and changes in lifestyle. Healthy living ideas from the project were difficult to put into practice and often met with resistance from other family members.Health impact of the project: better use of health services Some professional informants felt the local population were more appropriate users of services as a result of the project. However, the project was perceived to have had little influence over local service providers and the allocation of resources. 'I wouldn't say the project has got to the stage where you could show changes in the direction of resources or services, as a result of involvement of South Asian people' (Professional K). The project was considered to have failed in its remit to influence local service providers.Discussion This study used qualitative methods to explore the views of lay and professional informants. It suggests that there are important differences in perceptions of participation and its associated health gain. There are fundamental differences in the understanding of the term 'partnership with the community'. Lay informants did not consider the AHDP as a partnership. The equal nature of partnerships with the community is contested in the literature 8 with unrealistic expectations leading to disillusionment and frustration. The issue of power is considered central to the process of participation, 9 but professionals tend not to have to account for the weight they attach to local views. 10 The 'I plan, you participate' 18 philosophy may lead to failure in local participation projects. Engaging communities can be problematic and deprived communities may not be willing participants, particularly if the benefits of projects are not apparent and tangible. The Bangladeshi community, which is the most deprived in the area, participated the least in the project. Cultural insensitivity may hamper projects with the South Asian Community, but the heterogeneous needs of the South Asian community need to be acknowledged to ensure participation projects do not exacerbate inequalities. Campbell et al. 11 warned that expressed ethnic allegiance does not mean people will have common needs and interests that will unite them in local health initiatives. Madan 12 suggests that participating communities are 'made, not born' and the project needs to rethink its strategy for engaging all sections of the community. Previous studies have shown professional uncertainty and inability to relinquish power can also hinder participation projects. 13, 9 Health care professionals who are taught little on empowering and emancipatory approaches may find it difficult to participate themselves and enable participation from the public. Training in participatory education for professionals may address lay concerns about communication issues and enhance participation by professionals. Lay informants perceived health gain on an individual level in terms of knowledge gained and confidence achieved. Selfconfidence and self-esteem are developed through the participation process 14 and the project appears to have been successful in this area. However, there is no necessary link between knowledge gained and behaviour change. The project did not result in any socio-environmental changes, having relied more on an educational approach, rather than a community-development approach. Consequently, lay informants did not admit to any lifestyle changes. There was disagreement as to whether empowerment at an individual level had transmitted to health gain at a community level. Strong social networks 15 are thought to create healthier conditions, particularly amongst poorer communities, but there was disagreement amongst lay and professional informants as to whether the project had improved social cohesion in the local community. The notion of community is contested in the literature and studies show that implicit assumptions regarding sharing are often not held out in practice. 16 The local South Asian community is culturally diverse and geographically scattered and professional notions of increased social cohesion require further exploration. Appropriate and accessible health services impact on health gain, but the project was perceived to have had little influence on local services. There was little change within statutory organizations as a result of the project. Partnership models in some community initiatives may represent mediation of continued disadvantage, because they tend to be based on relationships of unequal power and allow statutory organizations to assume that projects will manage minority ethnic issues without any need for internal change themselves. 17 The weaknesses of this study included the limited access to the local population, which determined the opportunistic sampling strategy used for the focus groups. Although our results suggest that the views of the subsections of the community were consistent with one another, our small sample size may have limited access to a variety of opinions, reflecting the heterogeneous nature of the South Asian community. Key themes were identified and supported by the literature, which improves the generalizability of the results to other settings. The allure of community participation has captured the attention of policy makers in the UK with its promise of improvements in public health. However, the strategy, which was initially thought to be common sense and straightforward, is increasingly recognized as being quite complex. 10 This study uncovers issues of misunderstanding and conflict in one participation project. However, further systematic approaches are required to evaluate the policy in situ and demonstrate accountability for scarce health service resources.Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jpubhealth/article/27/3/241/1511165 by TU Wien Bibliothek user on 02 June 2023Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jpubhealth/article/27/3/241/1511165 by TU Wien Bibliothek user on 02 June 2023Atkin K, Rollings J.

City Steps is a five year community-based participatory research walking intervention designed to help lower blood pressure in a majority African-American population in southern Mississippi via community collaboration and capacity building, increased walking, culturally tailored health education sessions, and motivational interviewing. Building community capacity for physical activity is a key component of this intervention. Qualitative and quantitative methods have been used assess how project stakeholders perceive the community capacity building efforts of the project. This paper illustrates the baseline results of this mixed methods approach from the perspective of three groups of stakeholders: Project researchers and staff (RS); Community Advisory Board (CAB) and intervention walking coaches (WC). Eight constructs were examined including leadership, resources, external networking, visibility and recognition, personnel sustainability, ability and commitment to organize, communication with community members, and relationships with influential others. Quantitative results indicated significant differences among stakeholder groups for project leadership and personnel sustainability. Qualitative perspectives provided an opportunity to examine possible reasons for these differences. Overall findings provide direction related to improving intervention outcomes and sustainability.","Community based participatory research (CBPR) has commonly been utilized in low income communities and communities of color to address the complex health issues they face (Minkler, 2004) . The Federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality defines CBPR as ""a collaborative … approach designed to ensure and establish structures for participation by communities affected by the issue being studied, representatives of organizations, and researchers in all aspects of the research process to improve health and well-being through taking action…"" (AHRQ, 2009) . A core attribute of CBPR is the academic-community partnership in which both collaborate in an equal partnership to identify and address community health issues (Israel, Eng, Schulz, & Parker, 2005) and to share knowledge and expertise with one another to further action and change within a community (Israel, Schultz, Parker, & Becker, 2001) . This partnership must cross social, economic, political and cultural barriers to reach goals and become sustainable (Israel, Schultz, Parker, & Becker, 2001) . CBPR has been commended as a process that facilitates community capacity building in terms of health promotion (Shediac-Rizkallah & Bone, 1998) . Poole (1997) indicated that ""the purpose of capacity building is to foster conditions that strengthen the characteristics of communities that enable them to plan, develop, implement, and maintain effective community programs."" Capacity building encourages community members to address their own health issues and allows health practitioners and organizations to assist in the process (Labonte & Laverack, 2001) , thus promoting sustainable solutions through community empowerment and leading to improved health outcomes (Israel et al., 2010; Smith, Littlejohns, & Roy, 2003) . Evaluation and measurement of capacity building within community projects has posed challenges to researchers which include, but are not limited to, a lack of valid and reliable instrumentation, ever evolving community capacity constructs, and length of time required for community capacity building (Ebbesen, Heath, Naylor, & Anderson, 2004) . However, evaluation and measurement of capacity are critical in order to better define constructs of and track progress toward building community capacity and consequent health outcomes, as well as to understand elements and processes that contribute to capacity building. Various community capacity frameworks have been described which include a number of common constructs, among them resources, leadership, asking why, communication with community members, partnerships, and social or external networks (Goodman, 1998; Lempa, Goodman, Rice & Becker, 2008; Minkler, Breckwich Vasquez, Tajik, & Petersen, 2008) . Qualitative methods, including semi-structured interviews and focus groups with academic representatives, community leaders and members, in addition to the case study approach, have been extensively used to assess community capacity (Gibbon, Labonte & Laverack, 2002; Jackson et al., 2003; Labonte & Laverack, 2001; Minkler et al., 2008) . A few studies have employed a mixed methods approach to evaluate community capacity, an approach that is considered to offer promise in better understanding its role in health promotion (Gibbon et al., 2002; Labonte & Laverack, 2001; Smith et al., 2003) .BackgroundH.U.B City Steps is a CBPR walking intervention involving a collaboration among a public university, a local city government, and community members in a southern small city. A primary aim of this intervention is to lower blood pressure in participants who are drawn primarily from the African-American population of the community. Elements of the intervention include empowerment, culturally tailored health education, and motivational interviewing to identify and track progress toward personal health goals. As a CBPR project, a primary aim is to build community capacity to promote health through physical activity and nutrition. Aspects of the project that foster community capacity and therefore attainment of this aim include: 1) inclusion of staff and faculty with a vested interest in the community; 2) involvement of project staff, a community advisory board (CAB), local city government, local agencies, and project participants in program development, implementation, evaluation, and overall guidance of project activities; and 3) development of participants' skills and knowledge of health promotion to attain individual and community change. These are accomplished via core activities including 1) recruiting and training community walking coaches (WCs) a) to serve as role models and champions who will motivate their fellow residents to engage in physical activity and choose better eating habits and b) to establish walking groups which will provide social support to program participants for healthy lifestyle changes; 2) conducting monthly nutrition education and physical activity sessions focused on making more health-conscious choices; 3) providing health screenings for program participants; 4) using motivational interviewing to encourage participants to identify lifestyle change priorities; and 5) promoting local community walking tracks to increase their visibility and use by residents. The H.U.B. City Steps intervention also aims to assess community capacity for health promotion through the life of this CBPR project. The first step in this process was to engage the CAB in a collaborative process to identify and define a framework for assessing community capacity, through workshops conducted by research staff during the first project year. Having adopted the community capacity framework of Lempa et al. (2008) and its constructs, project staff guided the CAB in developing a working definition of each construct, from a community perspective. The CAB also developed a project mission statement and action plan for each community capacity construct. The H.U.B. City Steps community capacity framework and constructs then formed the basis for assessing perceptions of community capacity over the life of the project. This paper describes perceptions early in the life of this CBPR community intervention, after intervention planning and walking coach recruitment and training but before intervention kick-off, across three groups of project stakeholders, using a mixed methods design.Methods This assessment included two components, described in more detail below. The quantitative component assessed community capacity perceptions using a questionnaire adapted from an instrument developed and empirically tested by Lempa and colleagues (2008) with participants from community initiatives across the U.S. The qualitative component involved focus group type listening sessions in which responses to the quantitative questionnaire were elaborated further.Participants Three stakeholder groups were sampled for both components (Table 1 ). Project researchers and professional staff (RS) comprised a multidisciplinary team of researchers from nutrition, human performance, community health, and psychology, as well as the intervention, community, and recruitment coordinators who were all from the community. The CAB included members representing community based and civic organizations, city government, and local healthcare agencies. WCs were volunteer community members who had been nominated by self, peers or the CAB to serve as intervention walking group leaders. Approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Board prior to data collection.Community Capacity Questionnaire Community capacity scales developed by Lempa and colleagues (2008) were utilized, asking representatives of each stakeholder group to rate the H.U.B. City Steps collaboration and its performance relative to selected community capacity constructs from a total of eight: leadership, resources, external networking, visibility and recognition, personnel sustainability, ability and commitment to organize action, communication with community members, and relationships with influential others. Item response was an 11-point Likert scale, with 0 denoting strongly disagree and 10 denoting strongly agree. Lempa and colleagues' 44-item, six-factor scale for leaders was administered to the RS and CAB, and included items on leadership (10), resources (5), external networking (7), visibility/ recognition (5), ability and commitment to organize action (10), and personnel sustainability (7). The 38-item, five-factor scale for non-leaders was administered to the WC and included items on leadership (10), resources (4), ability and commitment to organize action (10), relationships with influential others (6), and communication with community members (8). Three scales -leadership, resources, and ability and commitment to organize action-termed universal constructs, were common to all groups. Questionnaires were distributed to RS through office mailboxes, to CAB members at a regular meeting, and to walking coaches at a training meeting. Respondents were asked to complete the anonymous questionnaires at their convenience and return to research staff. For analysis purposes, a construct score was calculated for each construct by averaging all items under the construct and transforming to a 10 point scale. Total community capacity scores were calculated by averaging the construct scores (six for the RS and CAB leader scale, five for the WC non-leader scale, and three for comparisons across the three groups). SPSS 17.0 was used for all analyses. Total community capacity scores were compared between RS and CAB groups using an independent t-test and across groups for the three universal constructs using an ANOVA. MANOVA was used to examine differences: 1) between the RS and CAB for the six constructs in the leader scale and 2) among the three groups for the three universal constructs. For the MANOVAs, the Pillai's trace test was interpreted to examine model significance (p < .05) due to the negative skew of the data. This test is robust to such violations of multivariate analysis assumptions (Field, 2005) . Games-Howell post-hoc tests were utilized to examine differences between groups due to unequal group sizes (Field, 2005) .Listening Sessions Separate listening sessions were conducted with volunteers from the RS, CAB, and WC groups. Questions were developed based on the results of the quantitative analysis. The listening session question guide included a total of 27 questions divided across 8 constructs. Special attention was given to the constructs for which there were significant quantitative differences between groups. The same listening session questions were used across all three groups to elicit more detailed information about why the differences existed and how to address differences. Listening sessions were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Themes elicited from the transcripts were used to develop a qualitative analysis codebook, which contained descriptions or definitions for each of the codes. The codebook was developed by a team of two researchers, one project staff, and one CAB member (qualitative analysis team). The qualitative analysis team determined meaning and context using the eight constructs to help guide the interpretation. This method was utilized in order to increase internal consistency of code assignment. Once there was agreement across team members on context and meaning for each construct, quotes were extracted from the transcripts to provide examples for the interpretation. The team compared interpretations across groups and identified any notable differences between groups.ResultsCommunity Capacity Questionnaire Table 1 indicates the number of stakeholders from each group whose data were used in the analyses. Three CAB and three WC questionnaires were excluded from the analysis due to missing data on more than one construct.Researchers and Staff and Community Advisory Board: Six constructs Table 2 indicates the mean total score and construct scores for the RS and the CAB. The CAB scored total community capacity (M = 8.54; SD = 1.04) slightly higher than the RS (M = 7.98; SD = .85; n.s.). The CAB scored five of the six constructs higher than the RS. Visibility/recognition was scored lowest and ability and commitment to organize highest by both the RS and the CAB. Based on MANOVA, the model examining the differences in construct scores between the RS and the CAB was significant at F (6, 20) = 5.65, p = .03. As shown in Table 2 , perception of leadership (p = .01) and personnel sustainability (p = .01) differed between the RS and the CAB, with the CAB scoring these constructs higher than the RS. Walking Coaches: Five constructs-The total community capacity score for the WC calculated from the five constructs rated by this group was 8.70(SD = .84). Among the constructs, communication with community members had the lowest score (M = 6.68, SD=2.20); leadership, resources, and ability and commitment to organize all reached a mean score of 9 out of 10. Relationships with influential others was scored as 8.34±1.93 out of 10.RS, CAB and WC: Three universal constructs-The total community capacity score for the three universal constructs was 8.27±0.93 for the RS, 8.36±1.20 for the CAB, and 8.76±0.76 for the WC (n.s.; Table 3 ). MANOVA analyses indicated a significant difference across the groups for the three universal constructs at F (6, 39) = 3.60, p = .04. Post hoc analyses indicated differences between the RS and the CAB (p = .02) and the RS and the WC (p = .01) for leadership, with the RS scoring leadership significantly lower than the CAB and the WC.Listening Sessions Two listening sessions were conducted with the RS (n = 8), one with the CAB (n=8), and one with the WC (n=12). Notable quotes for each construct from all groups are listed in Table 4 . Data from the listening sessions on project leadership was examined closely because the CAB and the WC scored this construct significantly higher than the RS in the quantitative assessment. Of the nine questions asked concerning project leadership, one was ""How do you think we can make the leadership more visible to people in our community?"". There were several similar themes identified in the data analysis, including project members could attend community events outside of the project to build relationships with other community people and organizations (participation in community events) and they could make people aware of the project activities through networks such as faith-based, community organizations, sororities, and fraternities (awareness through visibility). Another theme viewed by project staff as a capacity building opportunity was that the community does not participate and understand the research aspect of the project (communicating knowledge about research with community members). Another question asked related to the leadership construct was ""In what ways or areas could the leadership increase their follow through on commitments that have been made?"". The CAB felt that the leadership was doing a great job, although the RS expressed reservations. One theme elicited from the RS reflected the need for more collaboration in the action plan (ability and commitment to organizing a collaborative plan). Like the WC, the RS felt that the community may not understand the research aspect of the project (communicating knowledge about research with community members). The CAB also expressed concerns in the area of leadership. One question was ""In what ways or areas does the leadership need to show more compassion?"". This elicited the theme that project members are not flexible by allowing the community to guide the project (flexibility in personnel sustainability). Conversely, another theme was that staff and community share openly and staff gives clear direction (leadership communication). When asked ""In what ways or areas could the leadership increase their follow-through on commitments that have been made?"", walking coaches viewed themselves as the leadership indicating that project and community members working with the project may not motivate others in the community to adopt or maintain healthy physical lifestyle because they themselves did not display sufficient motivation (leadership not motivated). The qualitative data focused on personnel sustainability was also examined closely since the CAB scored this construct significantly higher than the RS in the quantitative assessment. The first question asked concerning this construct was ""If H.U.B. City Steps leaders left today, what do you think would happen with the project?"". Themes elicited for the RS and the CAB included such things as all involved agree and understand the project (shared vision); all people are present that are needed to carry out the goals and objective of the project (human resources); training for community members to take on leadership roles and be effective in those roles (training community members); community and staff input in action plan (ability and commitment to organizing action); and personnel preparation for sustaining project (training of staff). Conversely the RS expressed the sentiment that project and community members would not continue to actively participate over the length of the project (non ability and commitment to organizing action for sustainability), perhaps explaining the quantitative difference between the RS and CAB. A similar question asked ""If H.U.B. City Steps leaders left today, what would need to happen for the goals of the project to be achieved?"". Themes elicited from the RS and the CAB suggested opportunities for building capacity. The CAB noted availability of such things as money, people, community groups and organizations to carry out the goals and objectives of the project (financial, human, and social resources), and that the project allows individuals to take on leadership roles (providing opportunities). Themes elicited from the RS reflected different perceptions of needs or limitations, and included such things as all people are not present that are needed to carry out the goals and objectives of the project (not enough human resources) and the project is not connected with all needed community groups and organizations to help carry out the goals and objectives (not enough social resources). As previously stated, of the five constructs assessed quantitatively for the WC, four were rated 8 out of 10 or above. The fifth construct, communication with community members, had the lowest score among the constructs. The elicited themes related to this construct were that the community does not participate and understand the research aspect of the project (communicating knowledge about research with community members) and that information diffusion to the community may not be as effective as it could be (audience not reached).Discussion and Conclusion The assessment of perceptions of community capacity for health promotion associated with the H.U.B. City Steps project described here was a baseline assessment before implementation of the walking intervention phase, but after considerable planning and training of walking coaches had been completed. This mixed methods assessment will be implemented annually to monitor changes in perceptions of capacity over the life of the project and to identify areas that need additional targeting for capacity building. The results suggest that the project is strong in its ability and commitment to organize; however, communication with community members and visibility/recognition of the project needs to improve. We are hopeful that this construct will be scored higher in the next round of data collection because we have taken suggestions from the listening sessions on the best ways to communicate and also better ways to make the project more visible. The project is naturally becoming more visible the longer it is in the community. In the quantitative analysis, leadership was viewed significantly lower among researchers and staff compared to the other two groups. The researchers and staff also perceived personnel sustainability significantly lower when compared to the CAB members. Neither of these differences was apparent in the qualitative analysis. This may have occurred because the researchers and staff may not have felt as comfortable sharing their thoughts in the listening sessions because they were not anonymous as was the case with the selfadministered questionnaire. Alternatively, this group may not have felt as confident about its own leadership role and performance on the project prior to the implementation of the intervention. As stated previously, there have been few quantitative instruments measuring community capacity that have been developed and empirically tested. Community capacity is an abstract concept and difficult to measure quantitatively, therefore it seems helpful to use a mixed methods approach in order to obtain more comprehensive information as a basis for evaluation and future action. A limitation of this study is the small sample size, therefore decreasing the power to detect differences across groups. Thus, additional areas that needed to be addressed to increase the capacity may have been missed. In this mixed methods assessment, the quantitative assessment allowed objective identification of specific areas where there were differences in group perceptions. The qualitative component then allowed further assessment of the reasons for these differences and ways to address them. This assessment has been a useful evaluation tool for this project in that it provides indications of strengths that are in place as well as weaknesses that need to be addressed to assure adequate community capacity for sustainability of project aims and accomplishments. Developing, identifying, and utilizing methods to evaluate community capacity is an important adjunct to CBPR due to its importance in promoting sustainable community change.

Background: Black and minority ethnic communities continue to face inequalities in mental health service access and provision. They are underrepresented in low-level interventions as they are less likely to be referred, and more likely to disengage from mainstream mental health services. Effective models that lead to improved access and better outcomes are yet to be established. It has long been recognised that to be effective, services need to be more culturally competent, which may be achieved through a co-production approach. Methods: This study aimed to evaluate the role of co-production in the development of a novel community mental health service for black and minority ethnic service users. Qualitative research methods, including semi-structured interviews and focus groups, were used to collect data to examine the use of co-production methods in designing and delivering an improved mental health service. Findings: Twenty-five patients enrolled into the study; of these, 10 were signposted for more intensive psychological support. A 75% retention rate was recorded (higher than is generally the case for black and minority ethnic service users). Early indications are that the project has helped overcome barriers to accessing mental health services. Although small scale, this study highlights an alternative model that, if explored and developed further, could lead to delivery of patient-centred services to improve access and patient experience within mental health services, particularly for black and minority ethnic communities.","IntroductionEthnicity and mental health Compared to the white majority, black and minority ethnic (BME) people in England mental health problems, they are said to face entrenched difficulties both within their communities and in their relationships with services (Wood et al., 2011) . Fitch et al. (2010) identified four key barriers that BME people face in relation to accessing mental health services: socio-cultural difficulties (health beliefs and mistrust of services); systemic problems (lack of culturally competent practices in mental health services); economic issues; and individual barriers (denial of mental health problems). Studies indicate that black men are almost twice as likely as white men to be detained in police custody under Section 136 of the Mental Health Act (Docking et al., 2009) and are 40-60% more likely than average population to be admitted to hospital from a criminal justice referral (Care Quality Commission, 2011) . A 2004 study by Rethink found that 88% of BME service users had been forcibly restrained under a section of the Mental Health Act compared to 43% of white service users; in community settings BME individuals were 40% more likely to be turned away when they asked for help than their white counterparts (Rethink, 2004) . Audini et al. (2002) concluded that black people are six times more likely to be detained under the Mental Health Act Part II than white people. Inadvertently, within BME groups these factors create a 'high level of fear associated with mental health treatment; that they will receive inappropriate and poor treatment (eg, excessive restraint and medication) and be discriminated against' [Department of Health (DoH), 2004: 6] . Resultantly, self-initiated help among BME people is low: they are less likely to access care through a general practitioner (Morgan et al., 2005) or be referred to mental health services (Fernando and Fernando, 2003) ; are under-represented in primary mental health services (Boneham et al., 1997) ; more likely to disengage from mainstream mental health services (McKenzie, 2012) ; and have worse mental health outcomes (Palmer and Ward, 2007) .Improving access and improving outcomes for psychological therapies Considerable effort has gone into widening access to mental health services by BME people. In 2005, the DoH published an action plan to improve equality of access, experience and outcomes for BME mental health service users (DoH, 2005) . The DoH initiated the 'Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) programme aimed to address health inequalities in mental health services through widening access to, and choice of, talking therapies throughout England for people with common mental health disorders including anxiety and depression (CSIP Choice and Access Team, 2007) . Analysis of access data in the first year of the IAPT programme identified BME groups as being under-represented within the service (Gyani et al., 2013) . As such, a further policy response was initiated: the development of the BME Positive Practice Guide in 2009 to be used by IAPT services to increase reach to these groups (CSIP Choice and Access Team, 2009). Subsequently, a range of models for engaging with BME people in mental health services such as staffing services with practitioners from BME background, the provisions of translation and interpretation services coupled with training of both staff and community providers have been implemented over the years (Moffat et al., 2009; Latif, 2010) . Despite this, studies have shown that equity in access and provision can be improved further (Green et al., 2013) . A co-production approach to improving outcomes Within many metropolitan areas of the UK there exists a wide range of primary and secondary mental health services. In the locality within which this study was undertaken, IAPT service was initiated in 2009. The IAPT service within the locality is delivered through a partnership between three organisations: a secondary care provider, a primary care provider and a voluntary organisation. Patients can access the service either through self-referrals via email, online forms or a telephone helpline or through their General Practitioner (GP). Following referral, it is usual for an initial assessment to be conducted by telephone, although sometimes this may be done face-to-face, to determine the next course of action depending on severity of their condition. The service has been proactive in engaging people from BME communities, using a range of strategies including employing people from similar ethnicity, promoting services at events aimed at BME people and Co-production to improve mental health outcomes 15 co-locating workers in GP surgeries to increase visibility, however, the uptake among the BME population remains low. To redress this scenario, a cross-sector initiative was established in 2012 tasked with addressing the inequalities in access to and outcomes of mental health services in the locality. The multi-stakeholder initiative brought together agencies including public health, a community organisation, mental health practitioners and the patients themselves to co-design and co-deliver IAPT services to BME communities. The collaboration was developed using the principles of co-production, an approach that prides in viewing service users as active asset-holders rather than passive consumers; promoting collaborative rather than paternalistic relationship between staff and service users and; putting the focus on delivery of outcomes rather than just services (Morgan and Ziglio, 2007; Foot and Hopkins, 2010) . The following framework was agreed by all stakeholders: (a) each partner would have a distinct role in the intervention, but operational decisions to be agreed before implementation. Public Health would lead in evaluation, IAPTprovide psychological services through facilitating group sessions and providing one-one advice to patients, Opportunity for All (a community group)host the project, train and engage local residents as Mental Health Champions/outreach workers to encourage patients to self-refer to project (b) the service would be delivered at a community setting, co-facilitated by a psychological well-being practitioner (IAPT) and an expert patient (local resident from a BME background), and (c) patients would self-refer, or referred by GPs, IAPT or local residents. Patients admitted to receive the psychological service would have to be (a) from a BME background (classified as non-white according to the Office for National Statistics), (b) resident within the locality of the service, (c) experiencing mild-moderate mental health problems, and (d) aged 18 years or above. The aims of the initiative, as agreed by all stakeholders, were to: recruit local residents residing within the study site to be trained and engaged as Mental Health Champions to undertake targeted outreach within the local community; deliver 2-hourly psychological interventions linked with mild-moderate physical activities over six weeksdelivered by mental health practitioners and co-facilitated by an expert patient; and on-going monitoring and evaluation of the project. The engagement of local residents was preferred as it was deemed fit within the principles of coproduction and that the residents were familiar with the study context. This study was undertaken to evaluate the use of a co-production approach in delivering IAPT services to BME people through the collection and analysis of data generated from interviews with stakeholders that were involved in both delivering and receiving services. The main objective was to assess stakeholder experience in both the participation of the co-production process and their views on barriers and enablers to accessing and completing treatment.MethodsStudy design The study used a qualitative research design consisting of semi-structured interviews and a focus group.Characteristics of the study site The service was delivered in a densely populated borough in West London which has a population of ~180 000 with some areas being within the top 10% most deprived areas in England (Smith, 2012) . A locality of ~2000 residents with a high proportion of BME people (33%-white British, 22% African and 14% Caribbean and a high proportion of people under the age of 15 at 23% (Smith, 2012) was selected. The population segmentation in the locality has been described as either 'deprived families in public housing' or 'poorer minority families' (Experian, 2009) . Higher levels of deprivation have been associated with higher burden of psychiatric conditions (Rai et al., 2010) . Inequalities are observed in ethnicity of patients admitted to adult psychiatric inpatient services within the locality; while the admission rate for patients from white ethnic groups is 58% times lower than the England average, the admission rate for BME patients is 96% higher than the England average (London Health Observatory, 2011) .Participants Only participants involved in the pilot co-production initiative were included in the study. Twenty-five patients self-referred to the service; of these 10 were signposted for more intensive psychological support due to the severity of their symptoms, and the remainder were treated within the pilot service, of which 11 completed treatment, representing a retention rate higher than is generally seen in BME service users. Other participants included members of the community group, public health, the mental health provider and Mental Health Champions.Data collection Participatory research methodologies were used in collecting qualitative data. The lead researcher was embedded in the initiative as a participant observer. Semi-structured interviews and a focus group were conducted across a range of stakeholders (Table 1 ). Semi-structured interviews were conducted with patients (n = 6), community group (n = 1), public health (n = 1), mental health provider (n = 1) and mental health champions (n = 3). Interviews with patients were conducted at entry to the service and exit. A single focus group was held with patients (n = 6) following completion of treatment.Analysis Hand-written field notes and audio recordings were made during the semi-structured interviews. Focus group discussions were audio recorded. The recordings were transcribed by the lead researcher (S.L.), and triangulated with field notes. The transcribed information was then sent back to respondents for validation before inclusion in the analysis. All data were analysed using an emergent thematic framework analysis approach (Gale et al., 2013) .ResultsParticipation in the co-production process Many patients had friends or relatives who had negative experiences within mental health care system and were quite suspicious of mental health professionals. Suspicion was particularly evident during the initial assessment session. Reactions ranged from refusal to sign-up, to overt expressions of disapproval of the mental health team's presence in the at the community site. 'Can you tell us the real reason you are here? You come disguised to help, but we all know what you are after…'. (P1) 'Why do you have to come here to deliver your service?' (P2) This prevented the IAPT workers from establishing a therapeutic relationship at the outset, making it difficult for them to implement the community protocol designed and used by the service. 'Many of them also had friends or relatives who had been in the secondary care system so were quite suspicious of mental health professionals. This was initially a barrier that prevented us from establishing a therapeutic relationship'. (MHP) Subsequent one-to-one sessions (and transparency imparted by the co-production process) eventually changed the patient's attitudes enabling them to address individual concern in relation to being part of the group and enabled IAPT workers to develop a personalised assessment system for each patient.'It was interesting to see at the [assessment], where everyone was like 'no not me'… everyone averting their eyes to avoid you asking them questions…to people come in, to have a seat outside waiting, wanting to come in to have one-to-ones and then opening up … a lot'. (MHP) Interviews and focus groups discussions demonstrated respondents across all categories (patients, community group, public health and IAPT) had a high regard for the co-production approach, perceiving it as one of the key factors that enabled participation in and success of the psychological sessions. All respondents reported a positive experience in participation in the co-production process. Many of them felt that by involving patients in deciding the venue, dates, times and influencing the content of the psychological sessions, patients were able to feel more in control and sessions were personalised to their individual needs. As some patients noted: '…these people are not here to tell me what to do… They are working with me, helping me to realise the greatness within me, to be able to find the strength that I had lost…. They are listening to my needs… [Though] it's a group it feels the session is just for me…'. (P3, 4, 5, 6 [Focus Group]) The patients felt the process was empowering for them as it helped them to play an active role in the delivery of the service. This view was echoed by service providers. Since they felt ownership of the group sessions, patients were very enthusiastic to complete the sessions, as demonstrated by the high completion rate (75%). The enthusiasm and commitment was evidenced by carrying out individual activities at home in between weekly sessions. The co-production process in this project provided invaluable insight to IAPT service, enabling the service to adjust their ways of working to better suit the needs of the patient group. This flexibility contributed to good patient experience, as demonstrated by the attendance and completion of treatment.'Because '…Back on Track Service [IAPT Service] has standard protocol and guidelines to be followed in delivering group sessions. We realised early on that this was not going to work. The patients instead decided the nature of content they needed to be covered in each session, which was determined by their individual goals they wanted to achieve. Likewise, the Back on track sessions tend to be continuous, each building on the previous session, such that if one fails to attend a subsequent session, they would find it hard to catch-up in future sessions. This didn't seem to work in this intervention. Each session was stand-alone, such that one would not miss anything should they fail to attend a session for whatever reason…'. (MHP)Enablers to accessing and completing treatment Respondents were asked to identify the factors that enabled them to access or complete treatment. All of the respondents said that by involving patients in developing personal goals, deciding venue, dates, times and session content gave the patients a sense of control. Patients interviewed expressed their commitment to attend the sessions as they felt their goals could only be complete if they attended all the sessions. sessions. The expert patient was someone the members of the community, including the patients, held in good esteem, as they were actively involved in community work. The expert patient was perceived as a 'high-achiever' with everything 'going well for them' and was seen as a 'welcome shock' to the patients to then discover that this person also experienced mental health issues. 'It is comforting to know that anyone can suffer from mental health problems…'. (P4) The patients were able to relate to the expertpatient's experience with many of them feeling confident that they too can get better. 'Sitting in the same room with [the expert patient] is very inspiring. If [the expert patient] was able to overcome [their illness] I too will be able to…'. (P2) The holistic approach adopted by IAPT was another element cited as an enabler to accessing and completing treatment. Respondents explained how they had other pressing concerns that affected their attendance or concentration in the sessions. For example, many had debt or child-care issues, which they felt were more pressing than mental health problems and needed to be addressed before or as they took part in the sessions, even though these very issues may have contributed to their mental health problems. When they revealed these to the IAPT team, they were offered signposting to appropriate organisations. This turned out to be a good incentive for patients to return to the sessions as they felt their needs were being met. 'We had other people that needed other services that were not psychological. Because we tend to know all these services and have good links with them…community links was key in sustainability [sic]…it's easy for someone to relapse if the key stressors that led them to the mental health experience is not addressed. One patient said to me 'So you tell me how you can help me with breathing. Yesterday, someone came to my door and put a gun to my son's face and said you need to give me this much money or I am going to kill your son'… And I said, 'Breathing is not going to help you. The police will'. (MHP) The visible onward support offered to other patients that were not eligible to enrol in the group was seen by the local community as a genuine desire for IAPT to help people. 'There are some people who came and were not able to be part of this intervention but have taken up our services, because they were severely unwell. For example someone who was brought here, the person never leaves their house, very anxious, and needed further Step-3 work with one of our psychologists within our service. It's likely we still have to do home visits with that patient because the patient never leaves the house, so our service will offer that. Another patient had a severe long-term health condition, we allowed the patient to come to the group, but also arranged for counselling to get one to one space to talk about her experiences'. (MHP) Patients interviewed cited the friendly nature of IAPT providers, who were also highly culturally competent, as a factor that helped them disclose their personal experiences and continued to attend the sessions. 'She is so friendly. I was able to open up. If it wasn't for her, I wouldn't have come back'. (P5) Delivering the intervention in the community setting, and having face to face assessment was said to be more desirable. All respondents said that they would have found it difficult to pick up the phone or travel to Hammersmith to access the service.Barriers: attitudes towards mental health In this project, many participants perceived the term 'mental health' to mean severe mental illnesses like psychosis or dementia. Common expressions from participants were: '…I need help to drag my neighbour to this project because…has lost it up here [pointing at the head]…'. (P2) '…I was frankly shocked at the amount of stigma around mental healthbecause we work in mental health and are used to certain terms, and because we know where we are coming from, we assumed that people will at least be aware of certain things. It was shocking to discover that people's knowledge of mental health was of people being 'sectioned' and thinking that such are the people that will be coming to participate in the group intervention. Hence people's initial response was that of fear and mistrust'. (MHP) Fear towards the notion of mental illness was further evidenced in participants' refusal at the initial assessment session to fill in registration forms giving their personal details for fear of a documented 'mental health record', with attendant concerns: '… label me as 'mental' hence unfit to work, which would make it difficult for me to obtain jobs in the future…'. (P6) These attitudes might contribute to the low uptake of mental health services among this population group. By involving the local community from the inception stage, it became possible to capture this view at an early stage. The local community recommended that one should abstain from using the term mental health when promoting the service. To this end, the project title was changed from mental health to 'A step to liveliness', perceived as being both desirable and necessary in capturing what patients would hope to achieve by enrolling into the initiative. A notable factor recorded in the initial assessment session with the Mental Health Champions was that some of them were in-fact experiencing mildmoderate mental health problems themselves, but appeared oblivious to this. As such, deploying expertise of culturally competent psychological wellbeing practitioners was invaluable. In separate meetings, they were supported in becoming aware of their own needs and took up other support services. At the initial assessment session, some patients appeared to exhibit obvious forms of 'disengagement' or 'disinterest', this was explored in the subsequent one-one sessions with the therapist. It emerged that some of the participants were in-fact next door neighbours. This made them hesitant to participate in group sessions or disclose their personal experiences for fear of being stigmatised or considered vulnerable. Over time, the realisation that they all have common experiences (including mental health problems) became a common bond. 'Initially, I was scared of what my neighbours would think of me. Then I came to understand that they were also having same problems as me. I felt a sense of relief. I started having hope that they would in fact understand what i was going through'. (P4)Discussion The findings of this study concur with other studies regarding mental health work with BME people (Hatzidimitriadou and Keating, 2012) . While social and professional attitudes towards mental health patients and treatments have improved over the previous half a century, some minority ethnic groups continue to misunderstand, repel and be frightened by the notion of mental illness, viewing it as encapsulating psychiatric conditions that lead to hospitalisation (Rabkin, 1974) . Anthropological studies have posited that the way people from different cultures uphold explanatory models around mental distress will influence their presentation of mental disorder and determine their health-seeking behaviour (Kleinman, 1987; Helman, 2007) . In this project, it was found that stigma and fear of disclosure, were acting in conjunction with an evident suspicion of the service during the initial assessment session, to provide a sizable barrier to engagement. For a community suspicious of mental health services and with complex stereotypes and stigma around mental illnesses, co-production offers a way to break down historical, systemic and socio-cultural barriers and provide better services to those most in need. Boyle et al. (2010) argue that the underlying principle of co-production is essentially a commitment to a transformational approach to delivering services, one that assumes that people's needs are better met when they are involved in an equal and reciprocal relationship with professionals, working together to get things done. The transparency imparted by the co-production process in this pilot changed the patient's attitudes and enabled IAPT workers to develop a personalised assessment system for each patient. The employment of a diverse ethnic workforce is a strategy commonly cited as a key to enabling access to mental health services by BME people as it increases positive response from service users (Increasing Access to Psychological Therapies, 2009), and although the involvement of service users in the planning and delivery of mental health services is generally viewed positively in increasing service satisfaction (Simpson and House, 2002) , these strategies had not led to increased uptake of service by BME people within the study site. However, coupling these strategies within the ethos of the co-production approach (which gave the users a say in deciding the MHP and the expert patient); it became apparent that these strategies were highly valued by patients and service providers, resulting in a service with a positive patient experience and good completion rate. The role the expert patient played in building links between the patient group and service providers should not be overlooked.Strengths and limitations of the study By using in-depth qualitative research methods, meaningful insights to the barriers and enablers in accessing services by BME people were attained. The involvement of a participant researcher (S.L.) allowed the development of trust and rapport between service users, IAPT workers and patients; allowing the researcher to explore study topics candidly, something that an outside observer would not have achieved. The ideology of co-production was consistent throughout all aspects of the study, with all partners involved in delivering the project gathering information on how to better engage with and deliver mental health services for BME communities. The participants found this method acceptable. The qualitative data capture minimised burden on participants in its design, as the interviews conducted at the entry and exit were embedded as part of the routinely collected data, hence no additional burden was placed on the delivery team. As a pilot service, the numbers referred to in this study are small and the intervention period is relatively short, but the benefit of a predominantly qualitative study is on the depth of understanding that can be built upon. However, this comes at a price of reduced generalisation. Further work will be required to determine whether results obtained in this pilot intervention will be found in other instances, yet the information obtained as a consequence of the interviews and focus groups provides insight into the needs of BME people in accessing mental health services.Service implications Indications are that the project has made inroads to breaking down barriers to accessing mental health services. The service has been approved for continuation and scaled out to neighbouring boroughs. The project site has been adopted by IAPT as a clinical site, with a notable increased service uptake. As further evidence of the success of this work, some patients have been trained and engaged as mental health champions and expertpatient group facilitators, spreading the community benefit of this intervention. Furthermore, a recent study by Green et al. (2015) exploring predictors of outcome has also demonstrated that while many patients do benefit from the treatments offered by the IAPT service, those from deprived backgrounds with more severe disease do worse, suggesting a need for improving the treatment of these patients, for which co-production may offer a potential solution (Green et al., 2015) .Conclusion This study indicates an alternative model that could be further developed leading to delivery of patient-centred services to improve access and patient experience within mental health services for BME people. Within the study a number of factors were identified that were important within the initiative such as the role of the expert patient, the cultural competency of the MHP and joint decision-making by the stakeholders. These factors alone are often employed by services to improve engagement with BME groups but fail to achieve much. Within the co-production context these factors are integral to the service and are operationalised from the start, proving that they are indeed effective mechanisms by which improved engagement and outcomes can be achieved, but within a coproduction framework. As such it is recommended that the service be rolled out in other areas with similar demographic attributes.Table 1 1 Outline of data collection methods and participants Data collection method Stakeholder groups Participants (n) Interview Patients (P) 6 Community group (CG) 1 Public health (PH) 1 Mental health provider (MHP) 1 Mental health champion (MHC) 3 Focus group Patients (P) 6I think some people came asking 'so what can you do for me, tell me what you can do for me'… I said…it's not really about what I can do for you; it's about what you would like.

The most common cause of dizziness in general practice is peripheral vestibular disease. Vestibular rehabilitation (VR) is a safe and effective treatment for peripheral vestibular disease that entails specific exercises to maximise the central nervous system compensation for the effects of vestibular pathology. An internet-based VR intervention has recently been shown to be safe and effective. Online interventions are low cost and easily accessible, but prone to attrition and non-adherence.

We will use a translated Dutch version of a British online VR intervention. Randomisation will be stratified by dizziness severity. The primary outcome measure is the Vertigo Symptoms Scale-Short Form. Intention-to-treat analysis will be performed, adjusting for confounders. The economic evaluation will be conducted from a societal perspective.

[2] [3] [4] The prevalence of dizziness increases with age; in adults over 85 years old, the prevalence exceeds 50%. 5 Dizziness is associated with a lower quality of life, occupational consequences and substantial interference with daily activities. 6 It is a major risk factor for falling, which can be especially harmful for older adults who are prone to fractures. 7 Owing to a decrease in work productivity and the high costs of medical care,Strength and limitations of this study ▪ This is a protocol for the first randomised controlled trial in general practice that investigates the effectiveness of the combination of online vestibular rehabilitation (VR) and face-to-face therapy (blended care) as a form of treatment for patients with dizziness of vestibular origin. ▪ By using a three-arm design, we will investigate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of stand-alone internet-based VR and blended care compared to usual care during 6 months of follow-up. ▪ We will attempt to develop a clinical decision rule for predictors of successful treatment to ensure personalised treatment. This will allow general practitioners to discriminate between patients who should receive stand-alone internetbased VR and those who are more likely to benefit from a blended care approach. ▪ Our internet-based intervention was designed for patients aged 50 years and over with access to the internet. Owing to these requirements, the treatment might not be accessible to all adult patients with dizziness of vestibular origin. dizziness also constitutes a substantial economic burden. 4 The most common cause of dizziness in general practice is peripheral vestibular disease (33-38%), which includes benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), vestibular neuronitis and Ménière's disease (MD). Other causes of dizziness are cardiovascular diseases (7-18%), neurological disorders (10-15%) and psychiatric disorders (1-17%). [8] [9] [10] In the Netherlands, as well as in the UK and the USA, >90% of all patients with dizziness are treated by their general practitioner (GP) without any involvement of a specialist, [9] [10] [11] mainly by reassurance, advice and symptomatic drug prescriptions. 11 However, none of the commonly prescribed drugs for vertigo have a well-established curative or preventive effect. 12 According to a recent Cochrane review-based on 39 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 2441 participants-there is moderate-to-strong evidence that vestibular rehabilitation (VR) is a safe, effective treatment for peripheral vestibular disease. 13 VR entails that the patient carries out graded exercises for 10-20 min daily for 6-12 weeks. These exercises include specific eye, head and body movements that stimulate the vestibular system and promote neurological adaptation to the altered input from the damaged labyrinth. 14 15 Performing these exercises may also help patients to overcome fear and avoidance of activities that provoke dizziness, and to regain skill and confidence in balance. 14 16 Importantly, when examining the 39 RCTs mentioned above, 13 most RCTs were performed among a selected population (eg, participants with canal paresis, otolith disorder or acoustic neuroma resection) and were conducted in a secondary/tertiary care setting. Only 2 of the 39 RCTs included a population representative of patients seen in primary care, these showed that nurse-delivered VR and booklet-based VR effectively reduce dizziness. 14 17 Despite the evidence for the effectiveness of VR, a previous survey suggests that <3% of eligible primary care patients with dizziness ever receive VR. 17 This may be due to a lack of availability or access to VR or a lack of knowledge about VR by the GP. 11 To date, access to VR usually involves a costly referral process to secondary care. 18 Also, finding suitable therapists can be difficult. 14 Prior to this proposal, we performed a survey among a sample of 1169 Dutch GPs to investigate the current use of VR in general practice. 19 Of the 426 responding GPs, 93% reported that they never used VR-by themselves or by referral-for the treatment of patients with dizziness. Not knowing how to perform the technique was the most mentioned reason by GPs not to use VR (92.4%). 'Takes too much time to execute' (7.2%), 'doubts about the effectiveness' (6.3%) and 'not recommended by national guidelines' (4.5%) were other reasons mentioned by GPs for not using VR. Consequently, it is not only important to generate additional evidence for the effectiveness of VR in general practice, but also to consider alternative models of treatment delivery to support the GP. In the past, VR has been successfully delivered via a booklet-based self-management programme. Bookletbased VR has been tested in two large primary care trials 14 17 and a voluntary population of members of the Meniere's Society. 20 All trials showed that application of VR resulted in a significant reduction of dizziness symptoms without any serious adverse events. 14 17 20 The internet could prove to be an alternative method to reach patients with dizziness in an inexpensive, easily accessible way. Booklet-based treatments are perfectly suited to be transformed into internet-based interventions. An online intervention can be tailored to the patients' individual needs, featured audio-visual content and provided various means of motivational support (eg, discussion boards or personalised text messages). 21 Internet use by older adults is growing rapidly. According to Statistics Netherlands (CBS), 80% of adults aged 65-75 years reported internet use in 2013, which is more than twice as much as in 2005. 22 A recent review by Aalbers et al 23 showed that internet interventions targeting lifestyle change in adults aged above 50 years can be effective. The authors concluded that internet-mediated interventions hold great potential in implementing effective lifestyle programmes and are capable of reaching large populations of older persons at low costs. 23 With these advantages in mind, an online VR intervention based on the VR booklet was developed in the UK. 18 The internet-based VR intervention has recently been compared to usual care in an RCT (Geraghty et al personal communication). The trial was conducted in a general practice population and included 296 patients. Patients in the online VR intervention group experienced significantly less dizziness and dizziness-related disability at 6 months, compared to those in the usual care group. We will translate the British online VR intervention into Dutch. No alterations in the content of the translated programme will be made. In addition to this, we will also investigate a different form of delivery in which the use of the online intervention is supported by a healthcare professional. Despite the advantages, unguided internet interventions can be associated with substantial attrition and non-adherence. A combination of online and face-to-face therapy ('blended care') may reduce attrition and nonadherence, offering patients the best of both worlds. [24] [25] [26] In one of the booklet-based VR trials, 14 a subset of patients received additional telephone support by a trained vestibular therapist while performing the booklet self-managed programme. By focusing on addressing patient concerns, reassuring, encouraging adherence and ensuring proper use of the booklet, these patients demonstrated higher adherence to the treatment and a significant reduction in anxiety and depression. Face-to-face contact is likely to be even more effective than telephone support. In the Netherlands, physiotherapists with experience in vestibular therapy often make house calls, and they are used to encourage and reassure their patients when performing physical exercises. As such, they are perfectly suited to be the 'face' of an online VR intervention. The principal aim of this research project is to investigate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of stand-alone internet-based VR and internet-based VR with physiotherapeutic support (blended care) for patients with dizziness aged 50 years and over in general practice in comparison with usual primary care. The online intervention that will be applied has been proved to be safe and effective for patients aged 50 years and over (Geraghty et al personal communication). By assessing the benefits of blended care, we may be able to improve the treatment of older patients with dizziness. Furthermore, it will offer GPs a new-immediate, easily accessible and inexpensive-clinical tool for treating dizziness in general practice. Additionally, we aim to develop a prediction rule to help GPs to assess which patient groups are best suited for each type of treatment.METHODS AND ANALYSIS Study design We will perform a single-blind, three-arm, RCT among patients aged 50 years and older presenting with dizziness in general practice. We will compare the clinical and cost-effectiveness of stand-alone internet-based VR and internet-based VR with physiotherapeutic support ('blended care') with usual care. The intervention period will last 6 weeks and patients will be followed up at 3 and 6 months. The primary outcome measure will be dizziness symptoms at 6 months as measured by the Vertigo Symptom Scale-Short Form (VSS-SF). Figure 1 represents a flow chart of the study with an overview of the group classification and randomisation. By using the LifeGuide software, we will automatically (and nonintrusively) collect data on all aspects of intervention use, including which sections and pages are viewed, how often and for how long. In addition to this, we will perform semistructured interviews with 10-15 participants from trial arm 1 (stand-alone internet-based VR) and 10-15 participants from trial arm 2 (internet-based VR with physiotherapeutic support) to assess their experiences with the online intervention.Recruitment of study participants The large majority of patients will be recruited from the Academic Network of General Practices of the VU University Medical Center (ANH-VUmc). The ANH-VUmc includes a total of 50 active GPs. The network should be a sufficient source to attain our inclusion number. Other general practices in the Netherlands ( primarily in and around Amsterdam) may be approached if inclusion numbers from the ANH-VUmc prove to be insufficient. Eligible patients will be identified by means of a validated search strategy 27 that selects from the electronic medical records those patients within the set age range who visited their GP because of dizziness in the past 2 years. The GP will screen the selected lists of patients for potential exclusion criteria or other pertinent reasons for not inviting them, such as a terminal disease or a severe psychiatric disorder. The identified and screened potential participants will be sent a package by their GP containing a letter, a brochure with information about the trial and a contact form. If a patient is willing to participate, he/she can contact the research assistant by phone, email or by returning the addressed contact form. On making contact, the research assistant will provide additional information if necessary and check the eligibility criteria. These criteria are a good command of the Dutch language, access to the internet and an email account, persisting dizziness at time of inclusion that has been present for at least 1 month, and that is exacerbated by performing head movements. If the participant is eligible, the research assistant will make an appointment for a visit at the participant's home. The research assistant will bring an informed consent form with an addressed return envelope. The participant will be able to ask questions about the trial and the informed consent form during this house visit. After the house visit, the participant will be given 1-2 weeks of time to consider if he/she wants to participate in the trial. During that time period, the research assistant will be available to answer any questions over the phone that might arise. To participate, the individual is required to sign the informed consent form and return it to the research team by using the addressed return envelope. After this signed informed consent form has been received by the research team, an email will be sent to the participant with a link to the intervention website.Sample size and power calculation The sample size calculation for our trial is based on the comparison between participants allocated to trial arm 1 (stand-alone internet-based VR) and those allocated to trial arm 3 (usual care). In Yardley et al's 14 recent VR trial with VSS-SF as a primary outcome measure, booklet-based VR alone, compared with routine care, showed an effect size (Cohen's d) of 0.45, favouring booklet-based VR. Assuming that stand-alone internet-based VR will produce the same effect size as booklet-based VR alone, we will need 80 patients per group to test a two-tailed hypothesis with α=0.05 and β=0.20. As attrition from internet-based interventions can be substantial, 25 we will recruit a minimum of 100 participants per group (300 total sample) to allow for up to 20% attrition (80×100/80=100).Eligibility criteria Eligible patients are required to: ▸ be 50 years or older, ▸ possess a good command of the Dutch language, ▸ have access to internet and an email account, ▸ have consulted a GP with dizziness symptoms in the last 2 years, ▸ still experience dizziness at the time of inclusion, which has to have been present for at least a month and ▸ experience dizziness exacerbated by head movements; otherwise, the dizziness is unlikely to have a vestibular origin. 14 The cut-off point for duration at 1 month was chosen because of acute BPPV; the Epley manoeuvre is deemed superior to VR. After 1 month, both treatments are considered equally effective. 28 Reasons for exclusion are: an identifiable non-vestibular cause of dizziness in the electronic record of the patient; medical contraindications for making the required head movements (eg, severe cervical arthrosis); serious comorbid conditions that preclude participation in an exercise programme or current enrolment in another-interfering-study.Randomisation and blinding All patients are required to complete baseline measures online. The online software programme will randomly assign participants to one of the three arms. During the automated randomisation, patients will be stratified by dizziness severity according to their score on the VSS-SF. Participants with a VSS-SF score of <12 points will be classified as low severity patients, whereas participants with 12 or more points will be classified as high severity patients. Patients are automatically informed about their allocated group. When patients are allocated to trial arm 2 (blended care), an email will be sent to the principal investigator. The principal investigator will select and contact one of the trained physiotherapists, depending on the location of the patient. The physiotherapist will contact the patient within 24 hours to plan the first therapeutic session. Since VR is a behavioural intervention, it is not possible for patients to be blinded to allocation. At 3 and 6 months, they will receive an email-and, if necessary, a reminder-to complete follow-up measures online. If participants still fail to respond, an independent research assistant will call them to encourage them to fill out the questionnaires online. The research assistant analysing the questionnaire data will be blind to treatment allocation.Intervention Internet-based VR (trial arm 1) VR entails specific exercises with the aim of maximising central nervous system compensation for vestibular pathology. Recently, specific components have been defined, namely compensation (using motion to habituate or reduce responsiveness to repetitive stimuli and to rebalance tonic activity within the vestibular nuclei), adaptation (using repetitive and provocative movements of the head and/or eyes to reduce error and restore vestibule-ocular reflex gain), substitution ( promoting the use of individual or combinations of sensory inputs) and motor learning principles (changing movement behaviour). Additionally, deliberately provoking dizziness in a controlled context functions as a form of exposure-based behaviour therapy. 15 18 A VR booklet was developed by following principles of behaviour change, derived from cognitive-behaviour therapy and self-regulation theory. 14 Self-efficacy is stimulated in the intervention by graded goal setting. This VR booklet was validated in three large trials. 14 17 20 The content of the booklet has been the basis for a recently developed stand-alone internet-based VR intervention. This intervention was developed by Dr Lucy Yardley, 18 member of our research group and coauthor of this manuscript. A prototype version of the intervention was tested among 18 adults in the UK. 29 Participants were positive regarding how easy to navigate, visually appealing and informative they found the intervention. Think-aloud sessions provided valuable data for informing small amendments to further enhance acceptability of the intervention for target users. 29 The recently conducted large trial by Geraghty et al (n=296) ( The intervention period will last 6 weeks for every patient. In the first session, information about dizziness and a rationale for the VR exercises will be provided. These exercises represent the core of the intervention. The weekly 'timed exercise scoring test' (TEST) will also be explained in the first session. VR exercises will be personalised for the patient and take into account his/her symptoms and balance capabilities. The online TEST is used to tailor the set of exercises. All of the exercises will have written instructions with video demonstrations, each performed by a male and a female model. In the first session, all six exercises (see box 1) are performed sitting down, afterwards the patients are asked to score how dizzy each respective exercise made them feel. The intervention uses these scores to automatically produce an exercise prescription for the coming week, custom built to the patient's dizziness symptoms. When performing the exercises while sitting no longer causes dizziness symptoms, the patient will be asked to perform the exercises standing up. By using this approach, patients will gradually increase the intensity of their exercises. Patients are asked to perform these exercises two times per day for 10 min. Patients will complete a different online session every week in the 6-week intervention period. The intervention incorporates information and advice on behavioural coping strategies. Previous research showed that symptom control strategies led to significant subjective health improvement and reduction of dizziness-related impairment. 20 Progressive muscle Box 1 Exercises 1. Shake: Turn your head from right to left and back again 10 times in 10 s. Twist your head round as far as it will go comfortably when you do this, and look in the direction your head is pointing. Wait 10 s after you have performed 10 complete turns, and then do 10 more. 2. Nod: Nod your head up and down and back again 10 times in 10 s. Tip your head as far as it will go comfortably when you do this, and look in the direction your head is pointing. Wait 10 s after you have performed 10 complete turns, and then do 10 more. 3. Shake, eyes closed: Carry out the shake exercise with your eyes closed. Wait 10 s after you have performed 10 complete turns, and then do 10 more. 4. Nod, eyes closed: Carry out the nod exercise with your eyes closed. Wait 10 s after you have performed 10 complete turns, and then do 10 more. 5. Shake/stare: Hold your finger pointing upwards in front of you and carry out the shake exercise while staring at your finger. Do not let your eyes move from your finger. Wait 10 s after you have performed 10 complete turns, and then do 10 more. 6. Nod/stare: Hold your finger pointing sideward in front of you and carry out the nod exercise while staring at your finger. Do not let your eyes move from your finger. Wait 10 s after you have performed 10 complete turns, and then do 10 more. van  relaxation and breathing techniques can decrease dizziness-associated psychophysiological arousal, whereas cognitive restructuring (challenging negative dizzinessrelated thoughts) and problem solving may lessen dizziness-provoking anxiety. 30 In addition, the internet intervention includes particular features to increase engagement. Scientific studies supporting the effectiveness of VR are summarised in plain language to increase patients' expectations regarding the intervention content. Email messages will be used to remind patients to log in to the intervention each week. Since our intervention is aimed at older adults, the look and design of the internet-based VR programme is simple with large font sizes and use of bullet points instead of paragraphs wherever possible. Importantly, internetbased VR will be offered to patients in addition to their usual GP care (ie, the intervention does not replace usual GP care). Internet-based VR and physical therapy (trial arm 2-blended care) Patients in trial arm 2 (n=100) will receive the same intervention as the patients in trial arm 1 (n=100). This internet-based VR intervention is described in detail in the previous paragraph. In addition to the internetbased VR intervention, patients in trial arm 2 will receive two sessions by a trained physiotherapist. Although the advantages of a stand-alone internetbased intervention are numerous (eg, easily accessible, inexpensive, enormous reach and automated tailoring), unguided internet interventions can be jeopardised by substantial attrition (ie, a patient leaves the treatment before the treatment goals are achieved) and nonadherence (ie, a patient remains enrolled, but fails to attend the scheduled treatment). Previous research on depression showed that combining online sessions and regular face-to-face psychotherapy can increase adherence and effectiveness. [24] [25] [26] Patients allocated to trial arm 2 will receive such blended care. The physiotherapeutic sessions will occur in week 1 and 3 of the 6-week intervention period and last for 45 min each. During these sessions, the physiotherapist will (1) provide information about the background of dizziness and VR; (2) elicit and address doubts and concerns about dizziness and VR; (3) teach the patient how to use the online intervention; (4) describe and take the patient through a set of VR exercises; (5) advise on how to anticipate and cope with obstacles to adherence and (6) provide support and encourage adherence. The first session will focus on making the patient feel comfortable with the VR exercises. The second session will focus more on adherence to the treatment and will therefore be planned in the third week. Performing VR exercises can slightly increase the dizziness at first. During the second session, the physiotherapist will reassure the patient of the temporary nature of this exacerbation and encourage him/her to keep performing the exercises. The sessions will take place at the home of the participant. A physiotherapist, specialised in VR, will oversee that all participating physiotherapists adhere to the treatment protocol. We will conduct a process evaluation with the physiotherapists after the trial is completed. Usual care (trial arm 3) All included patients of trial arm 3 (n=100) will receive usual care by their GPs. After randomisation, they will be redirected to a web page within the intervention that provides more information about the content of their trial arm. They will not receive access to online VR at this time, but will get access after the trial is completed. It is emphasised that their cooperation in the trial is vital for the success of the trial. They are asked to log in to fill out the follow-up questionnaires after 3 months and 6 months. Participating GPs will receive a written instruction, asking them to diagnose causes of dizziness according to the Dutch guideline on dizziness 31 and to treat identified disorders according to the guidelines of the Dutch College of GPs. 31 Adverse events VR rarely causes adverse events. Previous trials with the validated VR booklet did not report any serious adverse events related to dizziness or the intervention. 14 17 20 A small proportion of patients reported minor, transient side effects like neck pain, feelings of nausea and an increase in dizziness. Recently, the results of the trial by Yardley et al (n=296) have illustrated the safety of internet-based VR (Geraghty et al personal communication). Eighteen hospitalisations were identified in a GP notes review undertaken at the end of the trial, 8 in the usual care arm and 10 in the intervention arm. None of these hospitalisations were related to dizziness. No dizziness/intervention-related serious adverse reactions were reported. Our version of the intervention will be a close Dutch translation of the British online VR intervention. Patients will be informed that minor side effects like a temporary increase of neck pain, nausea or dizziness may occur. They will be advised that these sensations are likely to disappear within 2 weeks by performing the exercises more slowly. All adverse events that occur to a participant during this study, whether or not considered related to VR, will be recorded. The Medical Ethical Committee of the VU Medical Center will be notified within 15 days in the case of the occurrence of a serious adverse event during the study. We will inform the participants and the Medical Ethical Committee if anything occurs, on the basis of which it appears that the disadvantages of participation may be significantly greater than that was foreseen in the research proposal. The study will then be suspended pending further review by the Medical Ethical Committee. Serious medical complications as a result of our VR intervention are very unlikely. Previous trials have generated a considerable body of evidence for the safety of VR 13 14 17 20 (Geraghty et al personal communication).Data collection and storage The Dutch intervention platform will be created using the LifeGuide software (https://www.lifeguideonline. org). LifeGuide is a set of open source software tools, which allows intervention designers to create interactive web-based interventions. The University of Southampton developed the LifeGuide software in 2008. Since then, numerous successful internet-based intervention trials using LifeGuide have been performed and published in high-impact scientific journals. These trials include public health interventions (eg, smoking cessation) 32 and illness management interventions. 33 34 The LifeGuide software not only allows the user to create the intervention but also contains a data management system. LifeGuide collects output data on participant use and outcomes, stores it securely and provides facilities for collating and providing anonymised data. 21 Patients will fill out a questionnaire at baseline, 3 months follow-up and 6 months follow-up. By using the LifeGuide software, we will also automatically (and nonintrusively) collect data on all aspects of intervention use, including which sections and pages are viewed, how often and for how long. We will use participant identification numbers and the principal investigator will safeguard the key to the code of the participant identification number. Only the principal investigator and the research assistants will have access to the source data. Data will be stored on the LifeGuide servers in the UK. These servers are protected by the firewall of the University of Southampton, in accordance with the data protection policy of this institution. Researchers from the VU Medical Center and the University of Southampton signed a data processing agreement. Data will be kept for as long as the study takes, and at least 15 years after completion. Handling of the data complies with the Dutch Personal Data Protection Act.Measures A list of all measures and the moment at which they are collected is displayed in table 1 .Demographic characteristics Patients are asked to complete seven demographic questions regarding age, gender, living situation, comorbidities and level of education and five questions about the nature of their dizziness symptoms at baseline. These questions are designed by the research team and are based on previously used baseline measures. 14 17 20Primary outcomes The primary outcome measure will be dizziness symptoms at 6 months. The VSS-SF, 13 35 a short-form version of the VSS, 36 will be used to measure this. It is based on the frequency of 15 dizziness-related symptoms during the past month on a scale from 0 (no symptoms) to 4 (symptoms most days). Improvement can reflect either fewer or less frequent symptoms. The VSS-SF measures a broad concept of dizziness for which construct validity has been demonstrated. It has been used effectively in many previous VR trials 14 17 20 (Geraghty et al personal communication), and demonstrated excellent discriminative ability (area under the curve (AUC) 0.87), high internal consistency (Cronbach's α 0.90) and high testretest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) 0.88). 37 Health economic outcome measures Costs will be measured from a societal perspective according to the Dutch guidelines for economic evaluations 38 using internet questionnaires based on the iMTA Medical Consumption Questionnaire (iMCQ) 39 and the iMTA Productivity Cost Questionnaire (iPCQ) 40 at baseline, and after 3 and 6 months of follow-up. Healthcare costs include costs of primary and secondary care, complementary care and home care. Productivity costs include absenteeism from paid and unpaid work, and presenteeism (being present at work but not being able to work to one's full potential due to health symptoms). The friction cost approach will be used to estimate lost productivity costs. For the valuation of healthcare utilisation, standard prices published in the Dutch costing guidelines will be used. Medication use will be valued using prices of the Royal Dutch Society for Pharmacy. 41 Quality of life will be evaluated using the 5-level EuroQol 5-dimension questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) 42 at baseline, and after 3 and 6 months of follow-up. The EQ-5D-5L is a self-report questionnaire consisting of five dimensions on which respondents indicate their own health state. The Dutch EQ-5D tariff will be used to calculate Quality-Adjusted Life-Years (QALYs).Secondary outcomesDizziness-related impairment We will assess dizziness-related impairment by using the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) at baseline, and after 3 and 6 months of follow-up. The DHI has 25 items with three answer categories ('yes', 'sometimes' or 'no'), investigating self-perceived physical, emotional and functional disability associated with dizziness. DHI scores range from 0 to 100. A higher DHI score indicates a higher level of dizziness-related impairment. 43 The DHI is a widely used self-report questionnaire, designed to quantify the impact of dizziness on everyday life. Construct validity exists for the DHI as a reliable indicator of dizziness-related impairment. 44 The DHI has high internal consistency (Cronbach's α 0.89) and excellent test-retest reliability (ICC 0.97). 43Subjective improvement in dizziness The subjective improvement in dizziness symptoms will be investigated by asking participants to report improvement or no change/worsening in subjective experience of dizziness (dichotomous) after 3 and 6 months of follow-up. 13Anxiety and depression The presence or absence of anxiety and/or depression -at baseline, and after 3 and 6 months of follow-upwill be assessed using the PRIME-MD Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ), 45 an instrument to assess psychiatric disorders. This is a self-report questionnaire, which consists of 59 questions and enquires about recently experienced psychiatric symptoms. Using the PHQ algorithm, we will determine for each patient the presence or absence of the diagnoses Panic Disorder, Other Anxiety Disorder and Major Depressive Disorder at baseline. The diagnostic algorithms of the PHQ have been shown to have good criterion validity with reference to gold standard measures of mental disorders. Patients might experience these questions about their mental health as invasive to their privacy. We will assure the patient that all collected information is strictly confidential and will be anonymised.Process evaluation outcome measuresQuantitative data The Problematic Experiences of Therapy Scale (PETS) 46 will be used to compare adherence to treatment in trial arm 1 (stand-alone internet-based VR) and trial arm 2 (blended care) after 3 and 6 months of follow-up. Patients in trial arm 3 do not have to fill out the PETS. The PETS is a brief measure to assess adherence levels and self-reported perceived barriers to adherence to physical rehabilitative therapy. It consists of 12 questions within 5 domains, that is, 'symptoms too severe or aggravated by therapy', 'uncertainty about how to carry out the treatment', 'doubts about treatment efficacy', 'practical problems' and 'lack of support'. These questions are then followed by intervention-specific questions about actual adherence levels to elements of the intervention; the questions to be used in this study have been used in previous studies of booklet-based VR. 14 20 Engagement of the digital intervention will be measured by automatically collected detailed data by the LifeGuide software with regard to intervention usage, number of logins, page views and time spent on each page. We will send a survey to all participating GPs and physiotherapists after the study is concluded to provide more insights in the views of the healthcare professionals involved in the intervention. Finally, we will contact patients who decided to discontinue the trial by telephone to assess their reason(s) for quitting.Qualitative data On their completion of the intervention, we will perform semistructured face-to-face interviews among a sample of 20-30 participants, 10-15 participants from trial arm 1 (stand-alone internet-based VR) and 10-15 participants from trial arm 2 (internet-based VR with physiotherapeutic support), respectively. The focus of these interviews is to learn about the patient's experiences of the VR intervention over the past weeks. The questions are about participants' existing management of their dizziness, their expectations about the VR intervention and initial experiences of engaging with it, any features they have found especially difficult or especially helpful, concerns they might have had about continuing and what they feel they had learnt. All interviews will be audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Box 1 gives an overview of all measures and times of collection within the trial.Statistical analysisEffectiveness intervention General characteristics of all participants will be described quantitatively. The data derived from questionnaires will also be presented in a quantitative way. Missing data will be handled with multiple imputation analysis. 47 For the effectiveness analysis, we will perform intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses. Patients in trial arms 1 and 2 that have completed all 6 weekly online sessions will be used for the per-protocol analysis. We will use multiple linear regression analysis to compare the primary outcome measure (VSS-SF) in participants allocated to trial arm 1 (stand-alone internetbased VR) and participants allocated to trial arm 2 (internet-based VR with physiotherapeutic support) with participants allocated to trial arm 3 (usual care). We will adjust for dizziness severity at baseline (the stratification variable) and any other potential confounders.Cost-effectiveness intervention For the cost-effectiveness analysis, 48 we will perform costeffectiveness and cost-utility analyses with a time horizon of 6 months, making discounting unnecessary. Societal costs will be related to the primary outcome of the trial and QALYs in the economic evaluation. The analysis will be performed according to the intention-to-treat principle. Missing cost and effect data will be imputed using multiple imputations. Differences in costs and effects will be estimated using bivariate regression models while adjusting for confounders if necessary. Incremental costeffectiveness ratios (ICERs) will be calculated by dividing the difference in mean total costs between the treatment groups by the difference in mean effects. Bootstrapping with 5000 replications will be used to estimate 95% CIs around cost differences and the uncertainty surrounding the ICERs. Uncertainty surrounding the ICERs will be graphically presented on cost-effectiveness planes. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves showing the probability that the intervention is cost-effective in comparison with usual care for a range of different ceiling ratios will also be estimated.Prediction model We will perform an additional analysis on the data to identify predictors of successful treatment in patients with dizziness for all forms of treatment. Secondary outcome measures will be analysed using linear regression for continuous outcomes and logistic regression for dichotomous outcomes, adjusting for dizziness severity at baseline and any other potential confounders. According to Moons et al, 49 we will develop three prediction models: (1) predictors of successful treatment with internet-based VR ( population: trial arms 1 and 2; N=200), (2) predictors of successful treatment with stand-alone internet-based VR ( population: trial arm 1; N=100) and (3) predictors of successful treatment with internet-based VR with physiotherapeutic support ( population: trial arm 2; N=100). We will perform multiple logistic regression analysis with 'successful treatment after six months' (yes/no) as a dependent variable. Successful treatment will be defined as: (1)  improvement in the VSS-SF score with at least three points (clinically significant change), 8 (2) improvement in the DHI score with at least 11 points (clinically significant change) 44 and (3) subjective improvement in dizziness symptoms. 13 Candidate predictors will be easy obtainable patient characteristics, for example, age, gender, education and dizziness characteristics. Prior to regression analysis, we will perform univariate logistic regression analysis to investigate the associations between separate candidate predictors and the dependent variable. To assess the reliability of the model, we will calculate the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit statistic and construct calibration plots. To assess the discriminative ability of the model, we will calculate the AUC. Since prediction models perform better in development cohorts than in other similar populations (overfitting), we will perform a bootstrapping procedure. During this procedure, we will repeat the entire modelling process, in order to validate the final model and to adjust (shrink) the estimated performance and regression coefficients.Process evaluation analysisAnalysis of quantitative data The PETS, the LifeGuide software usage data, the survey results of participating GPs and physiotherapists in the trial and reasons for discontinuing the trial will all be analysed using descriptive statistics.Analysis of qualitative data Thematic analysis will be employed to identify patterns within the transcribed face-to-face interviews. Two researchers will independently read and re-read the first interviews to gain an overall impression and generate a list of initial codes. This list will be discussed within the research group, in order to reach consensus on each code and to categorise the identified codes into themes. Once a provisional coding scheme is developed, two independent researchers will code the other interviews. Afterwards, the coding results of each interview will be discussed until consensus is reached. The results of the qualitative study will be used to provide insights into (1) patients' experiences during the intervention and (2) possible reasons for outcome and adherence results.DISSEMINATION An independent monitor from the Clinical Research Bureau (CRB) of VUmc will have access to the data and source documents of the trial. Monitoring will be performed in compliance with Good Clinical Practice and other rules and regulations in order to achieve highquality research and secure patient safety. We aim to widely disseminate the insights and results of this project to (national and international) GPs, GP trainees, elderly care physicians, elderly care physician trainees, physiotherapists and patients with dizziness. We will publish the research results in international peerreviewed journals. There are no restrictions placed on publication by the sponsor of this study (ZonMw, programma Kwaliteit van Zorg: Versnellen, verbreden, vernieuwen). If proven effective, we plan to make the intervention available to all GPs in the Netherlands. The website of http://www.thuisarts.nl has been developed by the Dutch College of GPs in 2011 in order to offer patients reliable medical information and to support GPs. 50 This site is increasingly visited by patients (6.2 million visitors in first half of 2014) and will function as an important resource to inform patients with dizziness. 50 Finally, we will distribute our results by means of (national and international) conference presentations. Up to now, other medical specialties in the field of dizziness, like ENT and neurology, are hardly aware of the growing expertise on dizziness within the discipline of general practice. Therefore, we also aim to disseminate the insights and results of this project to other relevant medical specialties in the field of dizziness.DISCUSSION Introducing blended care to treat dizziness Research on the effectiveness of the combination of online and face-to-face therapy (blended care) is scarce and has never been investigated in patients with vertigo. Stand-alone online interventions are susceptible to nonadherence and attrition. Blended care has been shown to be able to address these issues. 25 For instance, fear of exacerbation of symptoms may be an important reason for patients to discontinue their treatment. The encouragement and guidance of an experienced physiotherapist at this time may give patients the confidence to keep doing the exercises. Providing patients with personalised care Nowadays, interventions can be tailored to the individual needs of the patient. Tailored care is created by the online intervention by continuously re-evaluating the intensity of the exercises for each patient. Different patients (with regard to age, gender, education and dizziness characteristics) may also have different preferences. We will attempt to develop a clinical decision rule for predictors of successful treatment to ensure personalised treatment. With a decision rule, GPs will be able to discriminate between patients who are likely to benefit from stand-alone internet-based VR and those who need a combination of online and face-to-face therapy (blended care). The intervention may not only reduce dizziness and dizziness-related impairment, but also stimulate patients' self-management, in line with the current policy on medical care.Increasing treatment options for GPs and reducing healthcare costs The availability of an effective online intervention will offer a cost-effective alternative for treating dizziness, as costly referrals can be avoided. It may stimulate GPs to reduce inappropriate drug prescribing. According to the Second Dutch National Survey of General Practice, GPs prescribed ineffective drugs to as much as 10% of older patients with dizziness during the first consultation. 51 Moreover, adverse consequences of dizziness-such as falls, anxiety and depression-will be reduced, leading to less healthcare usage and healthcare costs. From a wider perspective, the project has the capacity to illustrate how easily accessible interventions in primary care may relieve the burden on secondary/tertiary care, leading to better care at lower costs. 52 Contributors VAvV wrote the manuscript.

Patients diagnosed with PPPD were randomly assigned to the VE group or VE with OS group. All participants received VE for 20 min using a virtual reality system with a head mount display once a week for 4 weeks. The patients in the VE with OS group additionally received OS for 9 min. We analysed the questionnaires, timed up-to-go (TUG) test, and posturography scores at baseline and after 4 weeks. A total of 28 patients (median age = 74.5, IQR 66-78, men = 12) completed the intervention. From baseline to 4 weeks, the dizziness handicap inventory, activities of daily living (ADL), visual vertigo analogue scale, and TUG improved in the VE group, but only ADL and TUG improved in the VE with OS group. Patients with severe visual vertigo improved more on their symptoms than patients with lesser visual vertigo (Pearson's p = 0.716, p < 0.001). Our VE program can improve dizziness, quality of life, and gait function in PPPD; however, additional optokinetic stimuli should be applied for individuals with visual vertigo symptoms.","Persistent postural-perceptual dizziness (PPPD) is a recently defined diagnostic syndrome that unifies key features of chronic subjective dizziness, visual vertigo, phobic postural vertigo, and related disorders 1, 2 . Because PPPD is a chronic functional and portmanteau disorder of the nervous system that presents as dizziness or imbalance due to a neurologic and a medical condition and coupled with psychological distress, a multidisciplinary approach for treatment should be considered 3 . Medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, cognitive behavioural psychotherapy, and/or vestibular rehabilitation therapy (VRT) are generally recommended in PPPD 4 . The theoretical basis for VRT is sensory reweighing, which is the redistribution of vision, somatosensation, and vestibular sense for balance 5 , but few studies have been conducted to determine whether specific exercises should be designed to augment an individual's other sensory strength or to boost vestibular weakness 6 . In particular, because VRT includes not only compensation training after vestibular loss but also postural exercises in other causes of dizziness or general unsteadiness 6 , it can be applicable to patients with PPPD, which is entwined by variable pathophysiology 3 . Among the sensory components of VRT, visual stimuli using virtual reality environments are not only manoeuvrable but also effective in patients with dizziness and visual vertigo symptoms 7, 8 . Because visual vertigo is a closely related symptom of PPPD 2 , specific vestibular exercise focused on visual stimuli can be an effective treatment in PPPD; however, few randomized controlled trials on the efficacy of VRT in PPPD have been reported. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to determine the short-term efficacy of customized vestibular exercise (VE) and optokinetic stimulation (OS) using a mobile virtual reality system in patients with PPPD.Results Characteristics at baseline. Of the 30 patients enrolled in this study, two patients in the VE group could not attend all training sessions (Fig. 1 ). Finally, 28 patients (age = median, 74.5, IQR 66-78, men = 12) completed the randomized intervention. There were no significant differences in the demographic characteristics, questionnaire scores, or timed up-to-go-test (TUG) time between the VE and VE + OS groups at baseline (Table 1 ).  Analysis of the visual vertigo analogue scale. Although complex visual stimuli, including VRT, are helpful for patients with visual vertigo symptoms 8 , the association between the severity of visual vertigo symptoms and the effectiveness of visual stimuli has not been elucidated. We analysed the correlation between VVAS at baseline and the change in the VVAS score from baseline to 4 weeks in both groups to verify whether the initial severity of visual vertigo symptoms affected the final visual vertigo symptoms. The change in VVAS after completion of 4 weeks of exercise was significantly correlated with the initial VVAS in both the VE (Spearman's ρ = 0.881, p < 0.001) and VE + OS groups (Spearman's ρ = 0.544, p = 0.036, Fig. 3 ). Therefore, the change in the VVAS score of all participants was correlated with the initial visual vertigo symptom (Pearson's ρ = 0.716, p < 0.001, R 2 = 0.513).Discussion To our knowledge, this study is the first randomized trial utilizing virtual reality-based VRT for the treatment of PPPD. We found that virtual reality-based VRT can improve vestibular symptoms, quality of life, and gait function in patients with PPPD. In both groups, patients with severe visual vertigo showed more significant improvements after completing our program than those with mild visual vertigo. Sufficient evidence indicates that VRT is a safe and effective treatment for acute and chronic peripheral vestibulopathy 9, 10 . Gaze stability exercises and complex visual stimuli exposure have already been verified and recommended as rehabilitation for patients with chronic peripheral vestibulopathy 9 ; however, VRT should be carefully tailored to the needs of patients with PPPD 3 . Every day active sports can improve balance function at a young age, even for those with PPPD 11 , but the individual VRT for promoting habituation has to be attempted by stage because the phase approach is favourable to decrease patients' high anxiety and excessive vigilance to balance sensation, especially in the elderly 3 . Although VRT has been proven to improve subjective symptoms and posturographic results in chronic subjective dizziness 12, 13 , which type of exercise is effective specifically for PPPD has not been clarified. Interestingly, gaze stability exercises can improve the subjective and behavioural performance of patients with unilateral vestibulopathy despite an absent change in VOR gain from semicircular canals 15 . The remaining otolith function 15 and improvement of dynamic visual acuity 16 were suggested as possible mechanisms. Likewise, repetitive head and neck movements, including gaze stability exercises, are regarded as effective methods to decrease sensitivity to one's own movements (adaptation) and substitute other sensory systems for dynamic visual acuity, not restore vestibular loss in PPPD 3, 5 . Our program was designed to focus on (1) correct head and neck motion during gaze exercise movements based on vestibular adaptation according to the individual's ability, and (2) adequate visual stimuli that were closest to reality and could arouse interest in promoting habituation and concentration. Because elderly individuals with chronic dizziness have a risk of falling, especially when unaccompanied by a supervisor, we did not include gait training in our exercise program. Visual stimulation with optokinetic or complex backgrounds would be effective for the improvement of visual vertigo 7 . In a retrospective survey study, patients with PPPD answered that habituation exercise was effective for the relief of their symptoms 14 . VRT using complex visual stimuli for visual vertigo has been developed from a simple optokinetic drum and rotating chair to treadmill in a virtual grocery store on a screen 7, 8, 17 . However, although optokinetic stimuli are effective in chronic peripheral vestibulopathy regardless of their frequency, velocity, type of texture, and position 7 , they can be intolerable because optokinetic stimuli that are too intensive and frequent are nauseogenic 18 . Optokinetic stimuli using a virtual reality system did not show additional efficacy in our study. Because the realistic background and/or active head-eye movements in our virtual reality-based VRT may fully satisfy the habituation process in the central nervous system of patients with PPPD 5 , additional optokinetic visual stimuli would be a surplus. The optimal type or feature of visual stimuli has not been settled for VRT, and a visual background such as a crowded square shown on the screen can be sufficient to improve visual vertigo symptoms in patients with unilateral vestibulopathy 8 . Moreover, marked improvement in our patients with severe visual vertigo reflects that the properties of visual stimuli should be individualized depending on the severity of symptoms in PPPD. Although visual vertigo is closely related to the main symptoms of PPPD, the quantity of dizziness from complex visual stimuli should be considered to develop a VRT strategy for PPPD. Some studies have shown significant improvement of subjective symptoms or static posturographic assessment by VRT using virtual reality programs in patients with peripheral vestibulopathy or visual vertigo 8, 19 . These studies used variable devices providing virtual reality situations from small and flat monitors to a planetarium with a treadmill. We designed our program to take wireless head mount displays because it does not take up much space, is relatively inexpensive we can operate it more easily and simply than projectors, screens, monitors, or other commercial rehabilitation tools (ex. Balance Rehabilitation Unit or Nintendo Wii), and it can produce very realistic stimuli in comparison to other bulky machines. Because enhanced reality and a high degree of presence can outperform the efficacy of VRT using a virtual reality system, HMD with a well-crafted exercise program would be the best choice for VRT, especially for inducing habituation and motivation in patients with visual vertigo 8 . Although the SOT of dynamic posturography did not change after our VRT, TUG was significantly improved. The gaze stabilization exercise, the main therapy in our system, can help elderly individuals with dizziness improve their gait function through adaptation of the vestibulo-ocular reflex, even in the absence of any vestibular dysfunction 16 . Additionally, sufficient habituation depending on the idiosyncratic strategies using these state-of-the-art facilities can be drawn to recover balance function during gait 6, 19 . The conflict between accommodation and vergence depth cues on stereoscopic displays or complex visual perception without self-motion could lead to significant motion sickness or discomfort when patients are exposed to complex virtual reality environments for a long time 18, 20 . However, therapies using more complicatedly designed virtual reality are effective for anxiety, provoking realistic reactions to feared stimuli and dementia 18 . In elderly patients (n = 236) without any experience with the virtual reality system, virtual reality cognitive therapy was significantly effective in their depressive mood, but only 1.4% of patients reported severe simulator sickness 21 . Because our virtual reality program did not include the targets or background objects moving backward and forward, none of our patients complained of severe simulator sickness. This study has several limitations. First, the duration of VRT and number of sessions might not be enough to improve patients' symptoms. Because patients enrolled in our study were mostly elderly, they could not visit the hospital easily or frequently. Home-based exercise using our system would be attempted clinically and be more effective for patients than hospital-based exercise. Second, there was no improvement in the SOT of dynamic posturography. The relatively short study duration and lack of balance or gait training in our VRT program may have affected the posturographic results. Additionally, the initial SOT of our patients was not severe because we excluded patients with falling risk. Our VRT program using a virtual reality system promoting vestibular adaptation and habituation can improve dizziness, quality of life, and gait function in patients with PPPD. Additional visual stimulation using optokinetic stimuli should be carefully provided depending on the quantity of visual symptoms.Methods Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient consent. The trial was registered at cris. nih.go.kr (KCT0003864, the date of first registration; 24/04/2019). This study was performed in accordance with ethical principles consistent with the Declaration of Helsinki. All of study protocol and informed consent were reviewed and approved by the corresponding health authorities and ethics boards/institutional review boards of Pusan National University Hospital (1903-001-076). Enrolled patients gave written informed consent for participation in the trial.Subjects. Between April 2019 and April 2020, 30 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of PPPD were recruited from a referred hospital. Subjects were between 51 and 82 years of age (mean ± SD = 71.3 ± 7.8). All participants fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of PPPD 2 . Patients were excluded if they (1) could not stand alone due to severe imbalance, neurologic deficit, or orthopaedic problem, (2) could not follow instructions of the rehabilitation program due to their cognitive problem, (3) were uncompensated peripheral vestibular loss, in which their dizziness or unsteadiness were provoked as distinct episodes of head motion-induced or physical examination including head thrust, headshake, or stepping tests 3 , or (4) had previous central vestibulopathy including stroke, infection, or demyelinating diseases, or vestibular migraine. Study design and randomization. We conducted a prospective randomized controlled study to determine the 4-week therapeutic efficacy of VE and VE + OS using a virtual reality system (Fig. 1 ). Based on the data from previous studies in chronic subjective dizziness 13 , we estimated that the proportion of 4-week efficacy of vestibular rehabilitation in chronic subjective dizziness would be 80% in VE and 40% in VE + OS. By adopting 0.9 power to detect a significant difference (p = 0.05, two-sided) and a dropout rate of 20%, 15 patients were required for each treatment arm. Thirty patients were randomly assigned to the VE or VE + OS groups. The randomization procedure designed in permuted sizes of 4 blocks was based on the web-based program provided by REDCap© (Vanderbilt University, USA). A physiotherapist conducted the disposed program approximately 20 min weekly for 4 weeks. The patients in the VE + OS group additionally had a crafted OS for 9 min. Before exercise on the visit day and after 4 weeks, we consecutively assessed the questionnaires, TUG test, and Computerized Dynamic Posturography in all participants. The participants also answered questions about simulator sickness after 4 weeks.Intervention program. Virtual reality equipment. An OCULUS GO virtual reality headset and controller were used for our program. The head mount display (HMD) is mobile and wireless and has a field of view of 110 degrees. The resolution was 2560 × 1440 K, and the refresh rate was 60 Hz. The total hardware weight of hardware was 468 g. Vestibular exercise program using virtual reality. We developed VE and OS with a virtual reality system and applied a patent collaborating the manufacturer (JCS Co., Ltd.). The exercise protocol was described in Table 2 . In a virtual reality environment, the target looks like a robot and moves horizontally and vertically one metre ahead along the centre. The target guided the participants to follow and let them know whether they were exercising exactly 15 degrees around the centre by audio guidance. When the participants successfully completed the exercise 10 times, the speed of the exercise was increased. The optokinetic stimulation program consisted of stars rotating around the yaw, pitch, and roll axes approximately 3 min in each axis in the night sky (Video 1). Outcome measures. Questionnaires. (a) The DHI contains 25 questions designed to assess a patient's functional, emotional, and physical symptoms that is validated in Koreans. A score of 0 indicates no discomfort, and a score of 100 indicates a significant self-perceived handicap 22 . (b) The ADL contains 28 self-rated questions for measuring the quality of life, which is scaled 10 points and divided into functional, ambulation, and instrumental skills for determining the level of functional limitation or disability in people with vestibular disorders 23 . (c) The VVAS consists of nine visual analogue scales, and subjects were asked to rate no dizziness (0) to extreme dizziness (10). Each scale pertains to a specific visual vertigo provoking situation (walking into supermarket, riding in a car, under florescent lights, at an intersection, being in shopping centres, riding on escalators, watching movies at a theatre, on a patterned floor, and watching television) 24 . (d) The Beck Anxiety Inventory is a 21-item self-report measure of the level of anxiety a person has experienced during the previous week. Timed up-to-go test. The participants were instructed to get up from a chair, walk three metres to a wall in an unobstructed room or hall, turn around, walk back, and sit down again. The time (seconds) taken to complete the test was recorded before and after 4 weeks of treatment 25 .Computerized dynamic posturography. A computerized dynamic posturography system using the SOT protocol (NeuroCom Smart Equitest system) was performed before and after the intervention. The subject stands on a computerized platform in six conditions (eyes open, eyes closed, surrounding walls moving, platform surface moving, platform surface moving with eyes closed, and walls and platform surface moving together). Three trials are performed in each condition. The computerized platform measures and calculates the subject's postural stability based on the subject's input through the platform force plates during the various conditions. If a patient is unable to complete a trial during the test, it is marked as a ""fall, "" resulting in a score of 0. Simulator sickness questionnaire. The SSQ was used to assess physical discomfort after exposure to the virtual reality program. The SSQ contains 16 items to measure fatigue, headache, eye strain, difficulty focusing, increased salivation, sweating, feeling of nausea, difficulty concentrating, fullness of the head, blurred vision, dizziness with eyes open/closed, loss of orientation with respect to vertical upright, and general discomfort. The intensity of sickness was measured at four levels: severe, moderate, slight, and none 18 . Table 2 . Vestibular exercise customized on adaptation and habituation. The target* in sessions 1 and 2 looks like a robot, which can move horizontally and vertically, one metre ahead along the centre. The target guided the participants to follow and let them know whether they were exercising exactly 15 degrees around the centre. When the participants successfully completed the exercise 10 times, they could increase the exercise. Ethical standard. This study followed the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and was performed according to the guidelines of the Institutional Review Board of Pusan National University Hospital (1903-001-076).ExercisesFigure 1 . 1 Figure 1.

Methods: Patients (n = 47) with chronic peripheral vestibular disorders were randomly divided into the VRT group (n = 25) and control group (n = 22). Patients in the VRT group received weekly supervised visits from PTs for a period of 6 months. Every other month, both groups were advised by neuro-otologists to increase the amount of activity in their daily life. All patients wore an accelerometer device, which recorded their physical activity for seven successive days before the end of the intervention. Patients also completed the dizziness and unsteadiness questionnaires before and after the intervention. Results: Subjective dizziness decreased significantly regardless of whether supervised VRT was administered; however, dizziness evoked by social activity and head and body movements improved more significantly in the VRT group than in the control group. In the VRT group, there was a significant negative correlation between the increase in sedentary behavior and improvement in subjective dizziness, and a significant positive correlation between the increase in light physical activity and improvement in subjective dizziness at the second month of intervention. The VRT group showed a significantly higher rate of increase in light physical activity than the control group, after 6 months of intervention. Conclusion: Supervised VRT could be highly effective in treating subjective dizziness in patients with chronic peripheral vestibular disorders. We believe frequent (weekly) and medium-term (6 months) PT-guided interventions may be highly effective in enhancing physical activity in daily life, and may subsequently improve subjective dizziness in these patients.","INTRODUCTION Individuals with dysfunction of the vestibular system report symptoms such as, disorientation, lightheadedness, disequilibrium, and visual blurring (1) . These symptoms decrease with an increase in vestibular compensation. However, a slow rate of vestibular compensation and prolonged dizziness are often observed (2) . A vicious cycle of dizziness is thought to be one of the causes for vestibular decompensation-induced chronic dizziness (3) . Symptoms of dizziness act as the starting points, as these symptoms initially cause anxiety and fear, leading to avoidance of activities. Avoidance of activities that might provoke dizziness not only causes delayed vestibular compensation, but also leads to depression and restricted social behavior, which reduces the quality of life in the long term. A previous study, using a wearable device to monitor physical activity, showed that in patients with dizziness, sedentary behavior (SB) was higher and light-intensity physical activity (LPA) and total physical activity were lower than in healthy adults (4) . In a previous study, more than 25% of patients with dizziness reported difficulty in performing activities associated with 29 of the 34 items listed in the activity questionnaire (5) . In patients who are in a vicious cycle of dizziness, it is important to present the diagnostic conclusions positively once the medical investigation has been completed. Patients should be educated to increase their physical activity and promote vestibular compensation (3) . One of the treatments for patients with vestibular decompensation is vestibular rehabilitation therapy (VRT), which aims to promote vestibular compensation by focusing on exercises that improve postural stability and gaze functions associated with head movements, thereby decreasing restrictions of activities of daily living, and enhancing the quality of life by encouraging social participation. The types of vestibular rehabilitation have become remarkably varied over the years, ranging from group exercises and customized exercise programs to internet-based programs (6) (7) (8) . In several randomized trials, VRT reportedly improved subjective dizziness, postural stability, gait speed, and dynamic visual acuity (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) . If the delay in vestibular compensation is due to a vicious cycle of vertigo, then lifestyle guidance from neuro-otologists (N-Os) may be a sufficient treatment. However, it is unknown whether the effects of VRT are influenced by the special training performed under the supervision of the physical therapists (PTs), by the increased physical activity and vestibular compensation promoted by lifestyle guidance, or by both. It has also been suggested that it is important to increase the amount of physical activity that was reduced due to the vicious cycle of vertigo. However, there are no reports that objectively verify the relationship between increased activity and improvement in dizziness. The objectives of the present randomized controlled study were: (1) to examine whether VRT under the supervision of PTs is more effective than lifestyle guidance in improving subjective dizziness, and (2) to investigate the relationship between VRTinduced changes in subjective dizziness and enhanced physical activity in their daily life.METHODS This clinical study was registered with UMIN (identification number: 000028832). The use of all patients' data pertaining to this study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Nara Medical University Hospital (identification number: 0889). The patients provided written informed consent to participate in this study.Patients Before conducting the trial, the appropriate sample size was estimated by power analysis using software G * power (Version 3.1.9.4) ( 14 ) for a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The effect size f was set to 0.4, alpha error probability to 0.05, beta error probability to 0.90, number of groups to 2, and number of measurements to 4. The calculated sample size was 36; therefore, 45 patients were recruited with an expected dropout of 20%. One hundred and five patients with intractable vertigo/dizziness who were hospitalized for undergoing several neuro-otologic examinations at the Vertigo/Dizziness Center of the Nara Medical University between October 2017 and September 2019, were enrolled. The examinations included the caloric test (C-test), video head impulse test (vHIT), and cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (cVEMP). These examinations were performed in accordance with previous reports (15) (16) (17) . Briefly, the C-test was performed by injecting cold water (20 • C; 20 mL) into the external auditory meatus over the course of 10 s, and the induced nystagmus was recorded using electronystagmography (ENG). Based on the maximum slow-phase eye velocity, the caloric test was classified as pathological when the ENG response was ≤10 deg/s. The vHIT was also used to assess the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) in the three semicircular canals using a lightweight video-oculography device (ICS Impulse; GN Otometrics, Taastrup, Denmark). The normal VOR gains were set to ≥0.8 (horizontal canals) and ≥0.7 (vertical canals). The vHIT was considered pathological when the gain was lower than the reference value, and a catch-up saccade was observed. The cVEMP assessed the first biphasic response (p13-n23) produced by the sternocleidomastoid muscle ipsilateral to the acoustically stimulated ear. In the present study, a right-left or left-right ratio in activity below 0.5 was considered pathological. In this study, the absence of bilateral VEMP was not considered pathological, as bilateral VEMP may be absent in healthy elderly people (18) . Patients who met the following criteria were enrolled in the study: (1) unilateral or bilateral peripheral vestibular hypofunction with pathological results on at least one of the three tests, (2) age between 20 and 85 years, and (3) presence of symptoms of dizziness and imbalance for at least 6 months. Subjects were excluded if they showed: (1) involvement of the central nervous system, (2) spontaneously fluctuating and intermittent vertigo, and (3) significant orthopedic or cardiac problems. Among the 105 patients initially enrolled, 54 were excluded based on the exclusion criteria and 4 declined to participate; a total of 47 patients finally participated in the study. In accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, all patients provided written informed consent after receiving a detailed explanation of the impending procedures. All patients were randomly assigned to one of the two following treatment groups, using a computergenerated simple randomization organized by the clinical study section at the Vertigo/Dizziness Center of the Nara Medical University: the VRT group and control group. One patient in the VRT group and four patients in the control group were unable to complete the program because of difficulty in commuting to hospital, and were excluded from the analysis (Figure 1 ). Patients in the VRT group attended weekly VRT sessions conducted by PTs for 6 months, with independent daily practice. Patients in the control group received explanations regarding the disease and instructions on increasing activity in their lives from N-Os and PTs, every 2 months for 6 months. All patients were assessed using ""the dizziness and unsteadiness questionnaire' before and after the intervention. Physical activity was also measured at the beginning and at month 2 and month 6 of the intervention. These evaluations were performed by author who was blinded regarding the groups to which the patients belonged.Physical Activity Measurement Physical activity was assessed using the Active style pro HJA-750C (Omron Healthcare, Kyoto, Japan). This wearable device estimates the metabolic equivalents (METs) every 10 s, based on combined accelerations measured by a built-in triaxial accelerometer, that has a minimum threshold of 3 mG and a sampling frequency of 32 Hz. The criterion-related validity of the METs estimated by this device has been previously confirmed with the Douglas bag method (19) . Patients wore the device on their lumbar region, except during water activities, from the time they woke up till they went to bed. Intensity of any activity that was below the detection threshold of 0 for ≥20 min, was considered non-worn time; data were adopted if the wearer wore the device for more than 10 h/day. All participants in the present study wore the device at the beginning of the intervention, month 2, and month 6 until 7 days of physical activity were successfully recorded (20) . Motor behaviors during the waking hours were classified into two types: SB and physical activity. Both, LPA and moderate to vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA) were included in physical activity. In this study, SB was defined as ""awake activity characterized by energy expenditure of 1.5 METs in a sitting or reclining position, "" LPA as activity between 1.5 and 3.0 METs, and MVPA as all activities over 3.0 METs (21) . The ratio of duration of SB, LPA, and MVPA to total wear-time was also calculated.Dizziness and Unsteadiness Questionnaire Use of this questionnaire is the best method to analyze subjective dizziness handicap data, because it facilitates the use of validated clinical metrics such as, ""Dizziness Handicap Inventory"" of Jacobson and Newman (22) . ""The dizziness and unsteadiness questionnaire"" used in this study was developed from ""Dizziness Handicap Inventory"" and has been available for the evaluation of everyday handicap due to dizziness in the Japanese population, since 1995. It includes 14 principal questions; an English translation has been presented in Table 1 (23) . For the assessment, the answers to all the principal questions were scored on a scale of 1 to 5: severe handicapExercise Program Patients in the VRT group underwent a developed version of the Cawthorne-Cooksey VRT (24, 25) , called MAHOROBA (i.e., an ancient Japanese word for peaceful and comfortable place) in our facility, under the supervision of PTs. MAHOROBA-style VRT consists of adaptation, habituation, balance, and gait training, with a gradual increase across three difficulty levels. Patients received weekly 1-h sessions from PTs and performed daily independent exercises at home using a booklet. Home exercises were monitored using a chart that was filled-in every day by the patients. Patients in both groups were evaluated by N-Os every 2 months to explain their current situation and provide guidance on their lives. The medication status varies from patient to patient; no medication changes were made during the study period to prevent any impact on the results.Data Analysis The statistical package for social sciences, SPSS 25 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA) for Windows was used for statistical analysis. Normal distributions of all data were tested using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Baseline characteristics were compared using the nonpaired t-or Mann-Whitney U-tests (numerical data: age and length of illness) and the Fisher's exact test (nominal data: sex and diagnosis). In each group, the differences in the scores for each factor on the pre-and post-intervention questionnaires were evaluated using two-way repeated measures ANOVA with group and time factors; Bonferroni correction was performed as post-hoc analysis. It has been reported that the Likert scale scores can be analyzed as ordinal scale scores using ANOVA (26, 27) . In the present study, we used two-way repeated measures ANOVA to analyze the scores of questionnaires on the Likert scale, if they showed normal distribution. To investigate the relationship between the changes in activity and subjective dizziness, we examined the relationship between the changes in final scores for each of the five factors in the dizziness and unsteadiness questionnaire from before to after the intervention; in the VRT and control groups, the changes in SB, LPA, and MVPA from baseline to 2 months and from preto post-intervention, were evaluated using the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. We calculated the percentage increase in SB, LPA, and MVPA from before to 2 months after the intervention and from the pre-intervention timepoint to the 6-month post-intervention timepoint. Differences in the change in activity levels between the groups were compared using an unpaired t-test. The significance level was set at <5%.RESULTSPatients Characteristics Data on the characteristics of the participants, including age, gender, duration of illness, diagnosis, and the test results used for diagnosis, are shown in Table 2 . There were no significant differences between the two groups in any of these variables (sex: p = 1.00, age: p = 0.73, duration of illness: p = 0.116, diagnosis, p = 0.448).Intra-and Inter-Group Comparisons of the Scores for Dizziness and Unsteadiness ANOVA (Figure 2 ) showed significant interaction between group and time factors and significantly higher improvements in the VRT than in the control group after the 6-month intervention, for the following factors: factors 1 (disturbance of social activity due to dizziness), 2 (body motion precipitating dizziness: head and sight), and 3 (limitation of physical activity: body movement). However, there were no significant interactions for factors 4 (emotional disturbance due to dizziness) and 5 (disturbance of interpersonal communications due to dizziness). The group factor showed no significant main effect on any factor in the questionnaire, and the time factor showed a significant decrease in scores of all factors after the intervention. Post-hoc analysis demonstrated significant improvements in scores of all the factors after completion of the 6-month-intervention, both in the VRT and control group.Correlation Between Improvement in Physical Activity and Subjective Dizziness Table 3 shows the relationship between each average increase in physical activity and improvement in subjective dizziness. The change in physical activity was defined as the difference between the pre-intervention and after 2 and 6 months of intervention. In the VRT group, there was a significant negative correlation between the increase in SB and improvements in the scores for factors 1, 3, and 5 from before to 2 months after the initiation of the intervention; a significant positive correlation was noted between the increase in LPA and improvements in the scores of all the factors at the same time point. There were no significant correlations between increases in any of the physical activities and improvements in any of the five factors at the end of the intervention (month 6). In the control group, we did not observe any significant correlation between increases in any of the physical activities and improvement in the scores of any of the 5 factors at the 2-and 6-month time points.Comparison of the Percentage Increase in Physical Activity Between Groups Figure 3 shows the difference in the ratio of change in physical activity between the VRT and control groups. The ratio of change in physical activity was the quotient of physical activity at pre-intervention by that after 2 and 6 months of intervention. The unpaired t-test revealed that the VRT group showed a significantly higher increase in LPA than the control group at the end of the intervention. There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of the rate of increase in SB at month 2 or 6 of the intervention. No significant difference was observed between the groups in terms of LPA or MVPA after 2 months of intervention. The MVPA was not significantly different between the groups at the end of the intervention. All data are available online in the data storage (http://dx.doi. org/10.17632/v8d9hfk84b.1).DISCUSSION The major findings of the present study were as follows: (1) supervised VRT by PTs was considerably effective in improving subjective dizziness; (2) in supervised VRT, an increase in the LPA at an early stage of the intervention was directly associated with a better outcome, with higher increases in LPA resulting in more reduction in subjective dizziness at the end of the intervention; and (3) the supervised VRT group also had significantly better final ratios of LPA than the control group. In the present study, we found that improvement in subjective dizziness in the VRT group was higher for three factors: disturbance of social activity due to dizziness, body motion precipitating dizziness (head and sight), and limitation of physical activity (body movement). This indicates that supervised VRT can effectively promote vestibular compensation. Both groups exercised, but the VRT group performed daily voluntary exercises aimed at improving the dizziness; this may explain the difference in this effect. To promote vestibular compensation, movements that are difficult to perform and are likely to cause dizziness must be completed; frequent PT-guided interventions are crucial in reducing fear while correcting the mistakes in exercise methods. There was no significant interaction between the factors of emotional disturbance due to dizziness and disturbance in interpersonal communication due to dizziness; this suggests that supervised VRT may be involved in improving motor abilities rather than mental effects on dizziness. A number of previous studies have also reported improvements in subjective dizziness and objective measures such as postural control ability after individualized VRT administered by PTs (9-13). However, the control group, which received only lifestyle guidance, showed improvement in all factors of subjective dizziness; however, the effects varied. The commonality between the two interventions was that the diagnosis was clarified through inpatient testing, and the interventions provided explanations and lifestyle guidance to eliminate the fear of vertigo. Yardley The VRT group showed a significantly higher LPA than did the control group after 6 months of intervention (VRT: 13.9 ± 25.2%; control: -0.7 ± 12.8%; mean difference [MD]: 14.6 ± 6.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1-28.0%; p = 0.0347). There was no significant difference between the two groups in the rate of increase in SB in month 2 (VRT: -2. reported that having completed the medical investigation, it is important to present the diagnostic conclusions in a positive light. Educating patients about the role of activity in recovery also provides the first step toward encouraging active selfmanagement of symptoms. These patients can be encouraged to resume activity simply by explaining that movement-provoked symptoms are an inevitable part of the recovery process and are not warning signals of possible serious damage and illness (3) . The improvement in dizziness symptoms in both groups in the present study may have been influenced by a welldefined explanation. While most previous studies have reported treatment effects over a short period of time, such as 4 weeks, the present study examined the effects of the intervention over a longer period of 6 months. Jung et al. (28) described an improvement in subjective dizziness in the non-VRT group at 3 months of follow-up. It can be argued that patients with chronic dizziness can improve in the long-term with proper diagnosis and lifestyle guidance alone; however, VRT under the supervision of a physical therapist can enhance this improvement. It is possible that the effect of VRT under supervision is influenced by both, the promotion of vestibular compensation by targeted exercises and the increase in activity by lifestyle guidance. The relationship between increased physical activity and improvement in subjective dizziness at the end of the intervention was significantly correlated with a decrease in SB, an increase in LPA, and an improvement in subjective dizziness at 2 months after the initiation of VRT. This relationship was not found in the control group. The improvement in subjective dizziness with VRT was influenced by increased activity early after the initiation of the intervention. Patients with chronic vertigo have been reported to have higher rates of SB and lower rates of LPA than healthy individuals (4), and it is possible that the patients in this study may have suffered from low activity as well as primary vertigo symptoms. Patients with dizziness in the chronic phase have been found to have an exacerbation of dizziness secondary to decreased activity due to a vicious cycle of dizziness, in addition to dizziness caused by peripheral vestibular disorders; intervention for these two factors may enhance the effectiveness in improving dizziness. There was no relationship between the amount of physical activity and improvement in dizziness in the control group, indicating that exercises that promote vestibular compensation and increase physical activity may have a major role in improving subjective dizziness. We observed that patients with chronic dizziness should increase their physical activity for vestibular compensation, and VRT under PT monitoring may enhance the effect. There was no correlation between the increase in physical activity and improvement in subjective dizziness after 6 months, suggesting that the 2-month change observed in the present study may be related to the improvement in dizziness due to an early increase in activity, rather than an increase in activity owing to an improvement in dizziness. Finally, the rate of improvement in LPA after 6 months was significantly higher in the VRT group than in the control group. It was considered that frequent PT-guided VRT may increase the rate of LPA in the daily life of patients with chronic dizziness. It is also possible that the increase in activity exacerbated the symptoms of vertigo temporarily; this may have made to adherence to lifestyle guidance more difficult in the control group than in those receiving supervised VRT. Using a 3-month booklet-based VRT in a voluntary practice setting, previous studies have shown that high adherence was observed in only 37.5% of patients; this was attributed to worsening of symptoms following the initiation of voluntary exercises (29) . Supervised VRT by a PT may be effectively continued until the symptoms of dizziness improve, even if the dizziness worsens temporarily. A multicenter, randomized, controlled trial on a physical activity promotion program by PTs for community-dwelling stroke patients reported no change in physical activity after 18 months to 2 years of intervention (30, 31) . There was a significant difference between the participants, and patients with chronic dizziness may have shown decreased activity owing to the vicious cycle of dizzinessanxiety caused by physical activity. Patients with dizziness show discrepancies in movement ability and activity, and we believe that correcting this discrepancy may encourage an increase in physical activity. In VRT, interventions in physical activities of daily living are important not only in terms of vestibular compensation, but also in terms of improving the quality of life. This study has some limitations. A major limitation is the design of the controlled intervention; the fact that patients in the VRT group had weekly contact with a therapist, while those in the control group attended only one counseling session every 2 months may have led to biased results. The improvement in subjective dizziness, which was the outcome of this study, may be affected by the frequency of contact; in addition, the effect of VRT in this study may have been influenced by the frequency of intervention. However, since the therapist and the evaluator were different, the bias due to the frequency of intervention was considered to be less. Since this was a randomized, controlled study, we were able to clearly determine the difference in treatment effects between supervised VRT for patients with peripheral vestibular disorders and the standard practice in Japan, which is to provide lifestyle guidance to these patients. In addition, the effect of the intervention was only evaluated in terms of subjective dizziness. Since the process of vestibular compensation involves improvements in balance and fixation, objective measures need to be investigated to examine the progression of vestibular compensation in detail. However, the VRT questionnaire used in this study assessed subjective dizziness in detail by dividing the factors into five groups. There were no differences in factor 4 and emotional disturbance, and there was an interaction between factors 2 and 3; this reflected dynamic vestibular compensation, and indicated that the VRT used in this study had an effect on vestibular compensation. Future research should examine the differences in the effectiveness of VRT depending on the type of disease, so that appropriate treatment options can be selected on the basis of individual characteristics of each patient.CONCLUSION In patients with chronic dizziness, frequent (weekly) and ongoing (for 6 months) supervised VRT supported by PTs was effective in improving subjective dizziness. The effectiveness of supervised VRT could be enhanced by encouraging a high level of LPA at the early stage of intervention; this should be maintained thereafter. Therefore, VRT sessions under the supervision of PTs could promote an increase in physical activity and improve the quality of life in patients with chronic dizziness.FIGURE 1 | 1 FIGURE 1 | Flow diagram of the study.= 5 , 5 significant handicap = 4, moderate handicap = 3, slight handicap = 2, and no handicap = 1 due to the symptom. The final score for each factor was calculated by adding all the individual scores for each of the three principal questions. The principal questions 1, 5, and 9 belong to factor 1 = disturbance of social activity due to dizziness; 2, 6, and 10 belong to factor 2 = body motion precipitating dizziness (head and sight); 3, 7, and 11 belong to factor 3 = limitation of physical activity (body movement); 4, 8, and 12 belong to factor 4 = emotional disturbance due to dizziness; and 1, 12, and 13 belong to factor 5 = disturbance of interpersonal communications due to dizziness.FIGURE 2 | 2 FIGURE 2 | Dizziness and unsteadiness scores in the VRT and control groups before and after the six-month intervention.

Six patients, including alH five who received the antibiotic by continuous intravenous drip (8.0 g daily), were cured. Dosage schediles resulting in maintenance of antibiotic concentrations in serum high above the MIC seemed to correlate well with treatment success.","Reports on the potential usefulness of cephalosporin anti- biotic in the treatment of salmonella bacteremia have been scanty and inconclusive (3). Cefazolin, which we found previously to be effective in acute enteric fever when admin- istered in a daily dose of 3.0 to 6.0 g for 11 to 16 days (7), has not been further evaluated by other investigators. Cefaman- dole, in a dose of 2 g intravenously (i.v.) every 6 h for 14 days, proved curative in 1 patient with typhoid fever (4); its use, however, in a dosage schedule of 60 to 240 mg/kg daily led to therapeutic failures in 7 of 19 patients with salmonella bacteremia (1) . The results of the latter study should be interpreted with caution because the majority of patients had underlying hepatosplenic schistosomiasis. Furthermore, variable dosage schedules were employed, and any possible relationship between a particular dosage regimen and treat- ment outcome was left uncertain. The present open trial was aimed at evaluating the thera- peutic response of the acute typhoidal illness to cefamandole in light of the in vitro activity of the antibiotic against the S. typhi isolates and its attainable levels in serum during treatment. Nine patients, five males and four females, rang- ing in age, between 16 and 40 years, were studied. In every case, the clinical picture was compatible with typhoid fever and the diagnosis was confirmed by isolating S. typhi from blood cultures. Bacteriological identification of the isolates was based on API 20E system (Analytab Products) and slide agglutination tests. None of the patients had a major compli- cation, another underlying disease, or laboratory evidence of impaired renal function. Susceptibility of the isolates to cefamandole was determined by the serial twofold dilution technique on Mueller-Hinton agar (BBL Microbiology Systems), using the replicating apparatus described by Steers et al. (5) . The final inoculum delivered on each spot of the agar surface contained ca. 104 CFU. The MIC was defined as the lowest antibiotic concentration inhibiting visible surface growth, but a faint haze or a single colony was disregarded. Cefamandole nafate (Eli Lilly & Co.) was administered to five patients by continuous i.v. drip in a total dose of 8.0 g daily. The other four patients received the antibiotic inter- mittently by short i.v. infusions containing 1.0 g, every 4 h in three patients and every 3 h in one patient (Table 1 ). During treatment, blood samples were collected for antibiotic assay. For the patients receiving intermittent therapy, the samnples were collected immediately before an antibiotic dose was * Corresponding author. administered to monitor the trough cefamandole concentra- tions in serum. Sampling from the patients receiving treat- ment by continuous i.v. drip followed an arbitrary schedule, as no specific timing was considered necessary. Cefaman- dole assay was carried out by the conventional cylinder- plate agar diffusion technique, with Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 spore suspension (Difco Laboratories) serving as the test species in accordance with a procedure previously described (8) . The nine S. typhi isolates were susceptible to cefamandole (as well as to chloramphenicol, cotrimoxazole, and ampicillin). Cefamandole MICs were in the range of 0.125 to 0.5 4g/ ml (Table 1 ). All five patients who received the antibiotic by continuous i.v. drip responded satisfactorily to treatment. Early symptoms and signs of improvement, including de- cline of fever, were noted within 3 to 5 days of therapy, and complete defervescence was confirmed after 3 to 9 days (Table 1 ). Treatment was continued for a total of 10 to 15 days without any apparent adverse effects, except for phlebi- tis at the site of the i.v. line that occurred in three patients and may have contributed to delayed defervescence. Three patients were followed up for a period of at least 4 weeks and none relapsed. The other two patients were discharged from the hospital afebrile and asymptomatic, but they were not available at a later date for evaluation. In contrast, cefamandole failed to control infection in three of the four patients who received intermittent i.v. therapy (Table 1 ). The acute symptoms persisted in severity and fever continued unabated. The absence of any signs of a therapeutic response after 5 to 7 days of treatment was an indication to replace cefamandole with another therapeutic agent and to consider the case as a treatment failure. Ultimately, all patients recovered without any complications or adverse effects. Despite the obvious limitations imposed by the design and size of this study, the results clearly point to the dosage schedule as an important variable in assessing therapeutic agents in enteric fever. It has been previously postulated that successful control of typhoid infection may not depend only on the attainable peak levels of the drug in serum as related to the MIC against the infecting organism but also on how well the inhibitory concentrations are sustained in between peak values (6) . Considering the individual patients de- scribed in this trial, the arbitrary ratio of the mean trough (or presumably sustained) antibiotic concentration in serum to the MIC against the infecting organism (Table 1 ) provided a quotient that correlated well with the treatment response. Although similarly derived, this quotient is different from the ""inhibitory quotient"" as defined by Ellner and Neu (2) in that actually attained trough antibiotic concentrations were Treatment dupa-Wt dfailydose Mmandole Cefamandole ment ration (days)   tient(kg) (g) and concn in MIC (>eg/ml) out-before com- no. used rather than the expected peak drug level. The calculat- ed quotient values exceeded 20 in four patients (patients 1, 2, 4, and 5) who were all cured, but they were less than 5 in two patients (patient 6 and 7) who were both considered to be treatment failures. The three other patients had calculated quotient values in the range of 8 to 12. Two of these patients were cured, and the third failed to respond to treatment. These observations lend further support to the view that the therapeutic potential of a drug in enteric fever is better explored by using a dosage schedule which would allow maintenance of drug levels in serum high above the MICs for the longest time intervals possible. In view of the wide range of permissible dosage schedules for new antimicrobial agents with promising in vitro activity against salmonellae, some controversial issues are best avoided if reference is made to treatment regimens rather than to the drugs per se in any conclusions pertaining to assessment or comparative evalua- tion of their therapeutic efficacy.

To assess the efficacy of gatifloxacin versus cefixime in the treatment of uncomplicated culture positive enteric fever. Design. A randomized, open-label, active control trial with two parallel arms. Setting. Emergency Room and Outpatient Clinics in Patan Hospital, Lagankhel, Lalitpur, Nepal. Participants. Patients with clinically diagnosed uncomplicated enteric fever meeting the inclusion criteria. Interventions. Patients were allocated to receive one of two drugs, Gatifloxacin or Cefixime. The dosages used were Gatifloxacin 10 mg/kg, given once daily for 7 days, or Cefixime 20 mg/kg/day given in two divided doses for 7 days. Outcome Measures. The primary outcome measure was fever clearance time. The secondary outcome measure was overall treatment failure (acute treatment failure and relapse). Results. Randomization was carried out in 390 patients before enrollment was suspended on the advice of the independent data safety monitoring board due to significant differences in both primary and secondary outcome measures in the two arms and the attainment of a priori defined endpoints. Median (95% confidence interval) fever clearance times were 92 hours (84-114 hours) for gatifloxacin recipients and 138 hours (105-164 hours) for cefixime-treated patients (Hazard Ratio[95%CI] = 2.171 [1.545-3.051], p,0.0001). 19 out of 70 (27%) patients who completed the 7 day trial had acute clinical failure in the cefixime group as compared to 1 out of 88 patients (1%) in gatifloxacin group(Odds Ratio [95%CI] = 0.031 [0.004 -0.237], p,0.001). Overall treatment failure patients (relapsed patients plus acute treatment failure patients plus death) numbered 29. They were determined to be (95% confidence interval) 37.6 % (27.14%-50.2%) in the cefixime group and 3.5% (2.2%-11.5%) in the gatifloxacin group (HR[95%CI] = 0.084 [0.025-0.280], p,0.0001). There was one death in the cefixime group. Conclusions. Based on this study, gatifloxacin is a better treatment for uncomplicated enteric fever as compared to cefixime. Trial Registration. Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN75784880","INTRODUCTION Enteric fever (Typhoid and Paratyphoid fever) is a systemic infection caused by the bacterium Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S.typhi) or Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi (S. paratyphi) which in humans is transmitted through the fecal-oral route [1, 2] . Today the vast burden of disease is encountered in the developing world where sanitary conditions remain poor. The best global estimates are of at least 22 million cases of typhoid fever each year with 200,000 deaths [3] . Crucially these are almost exclusively confined to resource poor countries. A recent Cochrane review [4] on typhoid treatments underscored the need for large sample size drug interventional trials, especially in children in whom this disease predominates. In 1948 the introduction of chloramphenicol revolutionized the treatment of typhoid fever [5, 6] . Unfortunately the emergence of resistance to the ''first line'' antimicrobials (for example, ciprofloxacin) has been a major setback and has given rise to the possibility of untreatable enteric fever [7, 8] . Gatifloxacin, a relatively inexpensive fluoroquinolone antibiotic in South Asia with once daily oral administration, is a new broad spectrum synthetic 8-methoxyfluoroquinolone which has the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against S. typhi from Nepal [9] . This in vitro activity needs to be verified clinically before gatifloxacin can be recommended for widespread use. Cefixime, an orally administered third generation cephalosporin, is a commonly used drug in South Asia for the treatment of enteric fever. Although cefixime is recommended as a drug of choice by the World Health Organization (WHO) for the treatment of resistant typhoid fever [10] it is relatively expensive in South Asia and has to be administered for a longer duration than the currently used fluoroquinolones. Clearly there is an urgent need for a treatment [11] that combines ease of oral administration, with speed of clinical response, reduction in secondary transmission and inexpensiveness. In this open randomized trial, we aimed to compare clinical outcomes for the treatment of uncomplicated enteric fever with gatifloxacin or cefixime in an outpatient setting.METHODS Participants The study was approved by Nepal Health Research Council and Oxford Tropical Research Ethics Committee. The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see Checklist S1 and Protocol S1. We enrolled patients who presented to the outpatient or emergency department of Patan Hospital, Lalitpur, Nepal from June 5, 2005 to September 8, 2005. Patan Hospital is a 318 -bed hospital located in the Lalitpur district in Kathmandu Valley. Patients were eligible to enter the study if they had clinically diagnosed enteric fever and their residence was within approximately 2.5 km radius from the hospital. Other inclusion criteria were that patients must be aged between 2 and 65 years, able to take oral medications, non-pregnant and non-lactating, without a history of seizures, able to stay in the city for the duration of the treatment, not known to have contraindications to either cephalosporins or fluoroquinolones and willing to give informed written consent to take part in the study. For children enrolled into the study, written informed consent was taken from a parent. Patients were excluded from the study if they had any signs of complicated typhoid defined as the presence of jaundice, gastrointestinal bleeding, peritonism, shock, encephalopathy, convulsions, myocarditis or arrythmia at the time of enrollment. Patients who had received a third generation cephalosporin, fluoroquinolone or macrolide in the week prior to presentation to our clinic were also excluded.Interventions On presentation to Patan Hospital all patients with fever without an obvious focus were referred to the enteric fever study clinic, where they were seen by the study physician. Patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to receive Gatifloxacin (Broadband TM , Novartis AG Basel, Switzerland) 10 mg/ kg/day [12] , in a single dose orally for 7 days or Cefixime (Cifex TM , Aegis, Nicosia, Cyprus) 20 mg/kg/day [13] in two divided doses orally for 7 days. Both drugs were administered in tablet form, cut and weighed in a sensitive scale to ensure that underdosing did not occur. To children who were apprehensive of swallowing the tablet, the drug was embedded in a banana and given. All patients were asked to swallow the study drug under direct observation during each visit. Each patient had haematocrit, total leucocyte count with differential, serum creatinine, total bilirubin, alanine aminotranferase(ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase(AST) measured, and blood and stool cultures were also performed before the start of the study intervention. The exact location of the patient's home was recorded and the first dose of drug administered at the clinic. We employed six Community Medical Auxiliaries (CMA) who had all received at least 15 months of prior formal primary health care worker training and been registered in a government recognized institution. The CMAs visited patients twice daily at their homes to perform a simple clinical assessment, measure the oral temperature and give directly observed therapy with the study drugs. The CMA visited the patient's home every 12 hours, morning and evening, until day 10 following enrollment or complete resolution of illness, whichever came later. The oral temperature of the patient was recorded twice every day by the CMA and a note was made of the timing and dosages of acetaminophen intake. The quality of patient-visits was ensured by regular unplanned supervisory checks in which the study doctor accompanied the CMA during the visits to patients' homes CMAs were asked to send patients immediately to the hospital on encountering any severe symptoms, and the patients also were asked to attend clinic if they had any severe symptoms at any other time. A symptom questionnaire was used daily during each visit to monitor any adverse events. Any patient with any severe symptom was seen by the study physician. The CMAs and study physicians held daily case conferences at which all the study patients were discussed. All patients regardless of the culture results were seen at hospital on Day 10 following enrollment. Blood and stool cultures were repeated on Day 10 in all culture positive patients and thereafter if the patient again became ill with probable enteric fever. All culture positive patients were followed up until six months after enrollment, and stool cultures were performed at the end of the first, third and sixth month. Microbiological Procedures Blood culture was performed on media containing tryptone soya broth and sodium polyethanol sulphonate, incubated at 37 C and examined daily for growth over 7 days [11] . Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi or Paratyphi A, B or C isolated in culture were identified using standard biochemical tests and specific antisera (Murex Biotech, Dartford, England). Antibiotic susceptibilities were determined during isolation using the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method involving antibiotic discs containing Nalidixic acid, Ofloxacin, Ciprofloxacin, Chloramphenicol, Ampicillin, Cotrimoxazole, Cefixime and Cefotaxime (HiMedia Laboratories, Mumbai, India). Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs) were determined later for organisms stored in glycerol (bacterial preserver) at -70C. The MICs were determined by Chloramphenicol, Nalidixic acid, Gatifloxacin, Cefixime, Ceftriaxone and Gemifloxacin E-tests TM (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sensitivity tests were interpreted using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute criteria for Enterobacteriaceae.Objectives The objective of the study was to compare the efficacy of Gatifloxacin and Cefixime in the treatment of uncomplicated culture positive enteric fever.Outcomes The primary outcome was the fever clearance time (FCT). FCT was defined as time to first drop in oral temperature # 37.5uC, remaining # 37.5uC for 48 hours. The secondary outcomes included acute treatment failure. Acute treatment failure was defined as including any severe complication; the persistence of fever (. 38 C); the persistence of symptoms for more than 7 days after the start of treatment , requiring additional or rescue treatment. If a patient had a temperature above 37.5 and below 38 for more than 7 days, but did not need additional or rescue therapy, and subsequently their fever cleared by day 10, that patient would not qualify as an acute treatment failure. Patients who failed the study treatment were given rescue treatment. The rescue drug was Ofloxacin 20 mg/kg/day orally in two divided doses for 14 days for the Cefixime group, and Ceftriaxone 40 mg/kg/day IV in a single daily dose for 14 days for the Gatifloxacin group. For the Cefixime group alone, if on day 8 of treatment the patient still had a fever of . = 38uC, the study drug was continued for 10 days and the patient categorized as acute treatment failure. If the temperature on Day 10 was .37.5, rescue treatment was given. A relapse was defined as fever with a positive blood culture within a month of completing treatment. All the relapses were patients that were initially categorized as successfully treated. Any patient given rescue treatment or prolonged treatment was precluded from the ''relapse'' group. Patients categorized as ''overall treatment failures'' included patients experiencing acute treatment failure, plus those falling into the relapsed category, plus all deaths within the trial follow up period.Sample size The sample size was calculated to detect a FCT difference of approximately 48 hours between gatifloxacin (assumed median FCT 156 hrs) and cefixime (assumed median FCT 204 hrs) [14] with p = 0.05 and power = 80%. The accrual time for recruitment was assumed to last 70 days, and that the last patient would be followed up until 8 days after recruitment. Therefore, we estimated the minimum sample size at 235 participants. Assuming a loss to follow-up of 5%, the sample size was calculated as 125 blood culture positive patients in each arm. Before the recommended sample size had been reached, once 169 blood culture positive patients had been enrolled, the independent data safety monitoring committee (DSMC) advised the Principal Investigators to stop recruitment to the trial based on a priori defined difference (p,0.01) between the two treatment arms in the primary endpoints of the study.Randomization-Sequence generation Patients were randomized in blocks of 100 from a computer generated randomization list, by an investigator not involved in patient recruitment or assessment.Randomization-Allocation concealment The randomization sequence and block size was concealed from the physicians allocating treatment and managing the patients, prior to patient enrollment. Treatment allocations were kept in sealed opaque envelopes, which were opened only on enrollment of the patient to the study after all inclusion and exclusion criteria had been checked.Randomization-Implementation Participants were enrolled by the study physician in the same order in which they presented to the study clinic. The sealed envelopes were opened in strict numeric sequence.Blinding Blinding was not feasible in this trial due to logistical reasons.Statistical methods All data were entered into an electronic database (Microsoft Office Access Version 2003, Wash., USA), and analyses was performed using Stata 9 (Stats Corp LP; Texas, USA). ). Continuous covariates were compared between groups of patients using the Mann-Whitney test, and categorical covariates were compared using the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test when appropriate. Fever clearance times and time to relapse were analyzed using Kaplan Meier survival curves and compared between the two groups using the logrank test. Binary outcomes (clinical failures) were compared between the two treatment groups using Fisher's exact test. Analysis was done in all randomized patients (intention to treat, ITT) and separately in patients with positive pretreatment culture (per protocol, PP) and negative pretreatment culture.RESULTSParticipant flow Of the 482 patients from the study area who were clinically diagnosed with enteric fever, 390 patients were enrolled into the study and randomized. 92 patients were ineligible, the main reason (49 patients) being a history of already having taken antibiotics (fluoroquinolone, macrolide, or third generation cephalosporin) within one week prior to study entry (Figure 1 ). Among all randomized patients, 187 patients were assigned to receive cefixime and 203 to gatifloxacin. 77 patients assigned to receive cefixime were blood culture positive for enteric fever whilst 92 of those assigned to receive gatifloxacin were culture positive .There were unequal number of positive patients in each of the study arms. One possible reason for the difference in number of culture positive patients between study arms is that cultures were drawn and culture results obtained after randomization had been done.Recruitment We enrolled patients who presented to the outpatient or emergency department of Patan Hospital, Lalitpur, Nepal from June 5, 2005 to September 8, 2005. All enrolled patients were followed up for at least 10 days after recruitment. Patients with a positive pretreatment blood culture were followed up for 6 months after enrollment. At the point that the DSMC asked to examine the trial data for the primary outcome measure in positive pre-treatment patients, the median fever clearance time was 92 hours (95% CI, 84-114 hours) for the gatifloxacin treated patients and 138 hours (95% CI, 105-164 hours) for cefixime treated patients. The difference between the two treatment arms was 46 hours (p,0.0001).Baseline data Admission characteristics are shown for all ITT patients (Table 1 ) and for all PP patients (Table 2 ). The median age of patients enrolled into the trial was 17 with a range of 2-64 years. There were no baseline differences in the culture positive and culture negative groups, other than temperature at presentation, AST and ALT which were higher and platelets and total WBC which were lower in the culture positive patients as compared to the culturenegative patients. Among all PP patients, there were no differences in the baseline characteristics between the two treatment groups. There were 40 patients, 15 in the gatifloxacin arm and 25 in the cefixime arm, who had taken amoxycillin up to the week before study entry. Of these 4 and 7 were culture-positive respectively.Numbers analyzed Analysis was done in all 390 randomised patients (ITT) and separately in 169 patients with positive pre-treatment culture (PP). All endpoints were analysed in the ITT and PP populations, apart from relapse which was only analysed in the PP population. 138 patients were evaluable for relapse; 20 had acute treatment failure and 11 withdrew from the study before day 7. In total, eight relapses (Figure 1 ) were observed. Relapse rates were 12.4% (6/51) in the cefixime group and 3.4% (2/87) in gatifloxacin group (HR[95%CI] = 0.185 [0.037-0.915], p = 0.0199). The Kaplan-Meier plots for the time of relapse are shown in Figure 4 .Outcomes and estimation Overall failures (acute treatment failure plus relapse plus death) were 29 in number (Figure 1 ). Overall failure rate at 1 month was estimated as 37.6% (95% CI = 27.14% -50.2%) in the cefixime group and 3.5% ( 95% CI = 2.2%-11.5%) in the Gatifloxacin group (HR[95%CI] = 0.084[ 0.025-0.280], p,0.0001) ( Figure 5 ).Ancillary analyses Among all culture positive patients in the cefixime group, one patient (1/70, 1%) had S. Paratyphi A cultured from her blood on day 10,but there were no (0/88, 0%) positive blood culture growths in the gatifloxacin group on day 10. No patient was found to be a persistent carrier of S. Typhi or Paratyphi A in their stool. A positive stool culture for S. Typhi was seen for one patient on day 10 and for another on day 30. Subsequent cultures were negative for both patients. We were able to obtain stool cultures from 147 (87%), 141 (83%), and 130 (77%) pretreatment blood culture positive patients at one, three, and six months respectively. Microbiology Antibiotic sensitivity testing revealed that all strains were sensitive to gatifloxacin, cefixime, ceftriaxone or gemifloxacin. One strain was resistant to chloramphenicol, and 136 (83%) of the pretreatment isolates were nalidixic acid resistant strains (NARST). Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined for 161 of the pretreatment blood culture isolates. The median (range) MICs for each antibiotic were as follows: gatifloxacin 0.125 (0.006-0.5) mg/mL, cefixime 0.380 (0.016-2.0) mg/mL, nalidixic acid .256 (1.5-.256) mg/mL, chloramphenicol 8.0 (1.5-.256) mg/mL, ceftriaxone 0.125 (0.047-0.5) mg/mL and gemifloxacin 0.125 (0.004-0.5) mg/mL.Adverse events Among all patients who received cefixime, there was one death, which might have been due to the development of disease-related complications during treatment. This patient was enrolled on the fourteenth day of his illness. On day 6 of treatment the patient complained of reddish stool and petechiae and was immediately admitted to hospital where he developed severe thrombocytopenia and gastrointestinal bleeding. He developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and was mechanically ventilated. He developed disseminated intravascular coagulation and succumbed to his illness on day 21 of entry into the trial. His pretreatment blood culture grew S. Paratyphi A which was sensitive to cefixime with an MIC of 0.38 mg/mL. One patient developed erythematous skin rash which needed two doses of oral antihistamine. Among all patients who received gatifloxacin there were 2 patients with excessive vomiting, which required intravenous antiemetics and fluids and observation in the hospital emergency room for upto 6 hours. There were an additional 23 patients who complained of excessive nausea and occasional vomiting after ingestion of the drug. Of these, two needed oral antiemetics; in the remaining 21 patients no intervention was required.DISCUSSION Interpretation In this study examining fever clearance time, acute treatment failure and relapse as indicators of treatment efficacy, that the results raise doubts on the usefulness of cefixime and suggest that gatifloxacin is a potent choice for the treatment of uncomplicated enteric fever. Febrile illness is one of the most common reasons for presentation to hospitals in many developing countries. In patients with fever, a very common clinical diagnosis is enteric fever, and S. enterica serotype Typhi or Paratyphi A are the two most commonly isolated pathogens from the blood in febrile patients in our hospital [15] . Before the advent of multi-drug-resistant (MDR) S. Typhi, chloramphenicol, ampicillin or cotrimoxazole were successfully used as the first line drug in the treatment of enteric fever. After the emergence of MDR strains, fluoroquinolones and thirdgeneration cephalosporins have been suggested and used as alternative antimicrobials [16, 13] . However the emergence and spread of point mutations in the gyrA gene of the bacterial genome [17] has conferred resistance to nalidixic acid and reduced susceptibility to the commonly used fluoroquinolones such as ofloxacin, leading to a poorer clinical response [18, 19] . A recent study in Viet Nam (CM Parry, unpublished) showed ofloxacin at the dose of 20 mg/kg/day was able to achieve a cure rate in only   64% of patients. In our context of high nalidixic acid resistance, gatifloxacin is the most effective and appropriate choice for treatment of enteric fever. Gatifloxacin (Sandoz, India) is relatively inexpensive (US$1.2 for a 7 day treatment course) and needs to be administered just once a day; both of these features are attractive in this setting. Gatifloxacin has a different binding motif than some other fluroquinolones [20] , and this characteristic enables it to retain activity against Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi or Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi A even in the presence of marked reduction in sensitivity to the older fluoroquinolones [17] . Cefixime, a third generation cephalosporin, is widely trusted to be effective for enteric fever as first line treatment, and is also used as second line therapy when initial treatment with a fluoroquinolone in a patient suspected to be enteric fever fails [13] . The fact that we saw a high overall failure rate associated with cefixime despite all of the strains being fully sensitive in vitro to the drug shows that the mechanism of action of cefixime [21, 22] may not be suited to the eradication of S. Typhi or Paratyphi A from the body or blood, and the poor intracellular penetration into macrophages and reticulo endothelial tissues where the typhoid organisms colonize [16] may be the cause of high failure rates. This study was unique in that we used CMAs to simulate a hospital setup in the community. CMA's directly observed patients taking the therapies, monitored fever and identified complications early; these characteristics have not been used in the past for typhoid trials although enteric fever in endemic areas [1] is treated on an outpatient basis. A major advantage of follow-up using CMAs was that the health workers knew the exact house location of the patients, and therefore follow up even after the successful completion of the initial seven-day drug trial was possible. In developing countries follow up of patients can be very difficult because of a lack of a proper address and relative unavailability of other means of communication, for example,a telephone. In addition to its relevance to culture confirmed enteric fever, another major strength of this large randomized study is that gatifloxacin proved to be more efficacious than cefixime with respect to fever clearance time and failure rates, even in the subgroup of patients who were clinically presumed to have enteric fever but who had a negative blood culture. Antibiotic treatment for typhoid in highly endemic areas is usually started based on the presence of a ''syndromic'' illness (acute fever for a few days and constitutional symptoms with no known source of infection) before culture results are known. Enteric fever, which continues to be a neglected disease [23] , is an important cause of morbidity and mortality, and facilities for blood culture or other reliable methods of diagnosis rarely exist in this setting.Generalizability Despite widespread resistance to Nalidixic acid in Kathmandu, and rising MICs to the older fluoroquinolones, ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, gatifloxacin has proven to be a potent drug for the treatment of enteric fever. Our study has relevance to South Asia, as resistance to nalidixic acid is widely prevalent there. Inevitably there will be emergence of resistance to gatifloxacin in areas with both MDR and NARST; and in this situation alternative antibiotics like azithromycin may need to be used. Of interest, in keeping with anecdotal reports from elsewhere in South Asia, only one strain was resistant to chloramphenicol in the present study. In areas of the world where chloramphenicol susceptibility has reemerged there may be an argument for reassessing chloramphenicol. In the present study Gatifloxacin was associated with nausea in 12% of patients and it may be important to forewarn patients of this possible side effect. There have been sporadic reports of dysglycemia caused by gatifloxacin [24] [25] [26] , and a recent population-based, case controlled study examining gatifloxacin usage amongst elderly individuals in Canada (mean age 77 years) who developed dysglycemia [27] also raises possible concerns. We did not do any blood sugar testing to look for dysglycemia. However in a study involving a younger age group where blood sugar testing was done the results revealed no dysglycemia: 887 children were treated with gatifloxacin (10 mg/kg) for otitis media and were followed for a year with no signs of alteration of glucose homeostasis either acutely or otherwise [28] . Clearly, it would be prudent to treat diabetics and elderly people suffering from enteric fever with an alternative antibiotic such as azithromycin and avoid the potential problems in this specific population with gatifloxacin. Limitations of the study The DSMC advised the Principal Investigators in this study to stop recruitment to the trial based on a priori defined difference (p,0.01) between the two treatment arms in the primary endpoints of the study. It is possible that if the trial had been continued with a larger sample size, other important information could have been gathered. In addition if patients and/ or investigators had been blinded to treatment assignments, the study would have been further strengthened; however as in most typhoid trials, it was not possible to do this due to the difference in dosing schedule for the two drugs being compared. Another limitation of this study was that temperature was only measured every 12 hours. However, to address this limitation, and to avoid missing increases in temperature, we checked temperatures for 10 days after enrollment, or for 48 hours after resolution of fever, whichever came later, in all patients. Finally, a telephone or internet based system of randomization would be ideal, but such a system does not exist here.Overall evidence We have compared the outcomes from our trial with those of other comparable studies, identified from a recent Cochrane review [4] , WHO typhoid guidelines [10] , and a search of Medline using these terms: cefixime, typhoid trials. The findings in our study are consistent with those of a 1995 study done in Viet Nam which showed that cefixime (20 mg/kg/day) for 7 days was inferior to ofloxacin (10 mg/kg/day) for 5 days in the treatment of MDR typhoid fever in children [14] . However other studies have suggested cefixime can be successful in the treatment of enteric fever [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] . Overall these studies, both descriptive and randomized, have examining the use of cefixime in confirmed enteric fever (total of 292 patients) and with treatment durations of mostly 14 days, have found failure rates ranging from 4% to 23%. Besides the general undesirability of a longer course with cefixime with increased morbidity and possibly complications, this drug is also more expensive (a 7-day course costs US $7 (Blue Cross Laboratories, India)). The present study is the largest randomized controlled trial ever conducted with cefixime in enteric fever and clearly shows, even in a setting with fully sensitive strains, that cefixime is a poor drug for this disease. These findings are contrary to the recommendation by many sources [13, 1] including the World Health Organization [10] that cefixime can be used as first or second line therapy in the treatment of enteric fever. Based on the present study, we believe gatifloxacin to be an optimal choice in the treatment of uncomplicated enteric fever.Primary outcome In all ITT patients, median (95% confidence interval) fever clearance time was 102 (90-117) hours for the cefixime group and 72 (62-80) hours for the gatifloxacin group, logrank test p,0.0001, Hazard Ratio[95%Confidence Interval] = 1.821[1.466-2.263]. The proportion of all patients failing through time to clear fever is shown in Figure2. At day 7 fever clearance rate was 73.9% (67.0% -80.3 %) in cefixime group and 94.2% (90.2% -96.9%) in gatifloxacin group.In the PP group, median (95% CI) fever clearance time was 92 hours (84-114 hours) for gatifloxacin recipients and 138 hours (105-164 hours) for cefixime-treated patients (HR[95%CI] = 2.171 [1.545-3.051], p,0.0001). The proportion failing to clear fever for each study drug through time after treatment is shown (Figure3). At day 7 the fever clearance rate was 62.7% (95 % CI = 51.5%-73.8%) in the cefixime group and 91.8% (95 % CI = 84.8%-96.4%) in the gatifloxacin group.In the group with negative blood culture but clinically diagnosed enteric fever (Fig 1), the FCT was 82 hours (95% CI = 44-94 hours) for the cefixime group and 39 hours (95%CI = 28-54 hours) for the gatifloxacin group (HR[95%CI] = 1.740 [1.309-2.312], p,0.0001 logrank test). Secondary Outcomes In the ITT group, overall, 30 out of 167 (18%) in the cefixime group and 2 out of 190 (1%) in the gatifloxacin group were acute clinical failures, OR[95%CI] = 0.049 [0.011-0.207], p,0.001, Fisher's exact test. In the PP group, 19 out of 70 (27%) patients who completed the 7day trial had acute clinical failure in the cefixime recipients as compared to 1 out of 88 (1%) in the gatifloxacin recipients (Odds Ratio [95%CI] = 0.031 [0.004 -0.237], p,0.001). Considering all patients to be failures who dropped out of the study before completion of the seven day treatment course, 26 out of 77 (34%) failed in the cefixime group as compared to 5 out of 92 (5%) in the gatifloxacin group (OR[95%CI] = 0.112 [0.041 -0.312], p,0.001).From patients with negative cultures, 11 had acute clinical failures, 10 (out of 97, 10%) in Cefixime group and 1 (out of 103, 1%) in the Gatifloxacin group, OR[95%CI] = 0.086 [0.011-0.686], p = 0.004, Fisher's exact test. Similarly, treating drop-out as treatment failures, we had 50 out of 187 (27%) in the Cefixime group and 15 out of 203 (7%) in the Gatifloxacin group acute treatment failures, OR[95%CI] = 0.219 [0.118-0.405], p,0.001, Fisher's exact test.Figure 1 . 1 Figure 1.

Study Design: Randomized controlled design study.,"Introduction Typhoid fever, a communicable disease caused by the bacteria Salmonella typhoid, has been a major cause of significant morbidity and mortality since antiquity. Salmonellae are important gram-negative bacilli which cause a spectrum of characteristic clinical syndromes including gastroenteritis, enteric fever, bacteremia, endovascular infections, and focal infections such as osteomyelitis or abscesses. Enteric fever, also called typhoid fever or paratyphoid fever, is a systemic febrile illness that is most commonly caused by Salmonella typhi. Less frequently, it is caused by S. paratyphi A, S. typhi B, and S. paratyphi C. Even ""nontyphoidal"" Salmonellae may cause severe illness which is consistent with enteric fever. Complications are more common in untreated individuals and they include intestinal hemorrhage and perforation, or focal infection such as visceral abscesses. In the preantibiotic era, approximately 15 percent of afflicted individuals died, with survivors experiencing a prolonged illness lasting weeks and debilitation often-lasting months. Furthermore, approximately 10 percent of untreated individuals relapse, while 1 to 4 percent becomes chronic carriers of the organism. Pakistan has the third highest incidence rate of typhoid occurring in the general population, worldwide. Typhoid fever is a common presentation in pediatric clinics. In the western world, the disease is close to eradication levels. However, globally, there are at least 13 to 17 million cases resulting in 600000 deaths. Typhoid fever represents the 4 th most common cause of death in Pakistan. It is transmitted by fecal oral root and by contamination of food and water. World Health Organization identifies typhoid as a serious public health problem. Its incidence is highest in children and young adults between 5-19 years old. WHO showed that the incidence of typhoid fever in Pakistani children aged 2-5 years was 573.2 per 100,000 persons per year. Also, similar incidence was seen in school going children and adolescents. The highest burden of disease is in children aged 2-15 years. Therefore, S Typhi represents the commonest cause of bacteraemia in this age group, and annual typhoid rates (confirmed by blood culture) in recent studies from India, Pakistan, and Indonesia range from 149 to as high as 573 cases per 100 000 children. The definitive diagnosis of typhoid fever is made only on isolation of salmonella typhi from blood, stool, urine, bone marrow etc, in the presence of characteristics clinical features. The case fatality ratio is 10% in the absence of treatment, and less than 1% with the use of antibiotics. Fluroquinolones i.e. Ciprofloxacin, are recommended as 1 st line therapy for children and adults infected with sensitive as well as multidrug resistance, S. Typhi and paratyphi. Third generation cephalosporins i.e. Ceftriaxone, is also useful but their use is reserved for complicated cases Multidrug resistance (resistance to chloramphenicol, ampicillin, and co-trimoxazole) sequentially increased from 34% in 1999 to 66% in 2005. In a prospective study in North India, there was a gradual development of resistance to fluoroquinolones over the past 7 years. No resistance was observed to fluoroquinolones in 1999, while in 2005, 4.4% resistance was observed to sparfloxacin, 8.8% resistance to ofloxacin, and a high resistance, 13%, to ciprofloxacin. Keeping in mind drug resistance in the community, it can be questioned that either of these drugs have difference in efficacy in terms of sensitivity and resistance pattern and relapse. In addition, we plan to conduct a study to find out the clinical response in children with typhoid fever treated with ciprofloxacin vs ceftriaxone. Thus, the results of the study will enable paediatricians to choose the first line therapy for the treatment of enteric fever in similar setting. In this way, timely management of these children will reduce morbidity specifically and also reduce the burden on hospital clinics in general.Methodology The study was conducted at Pediatric Department, Holy Family Hospital, Rawalpindi. Study was conducted over six months from 25th March 2010 to 24 th September 2010. A total of 88 patients with clinical diagnosis of typhoid fever were included in the study. 44 patients were treated with ciprofloxacin (Ciprofloxacin group), while 44 were treated with ceftriaxone (Ceftriaxone group).Consecutive (non-probability) Sampling Technique Children 5-12 years old of both sexes having typhoid fever were included in the study. All those having current history of intake of oral or I/V antibiotics (third generation cephalosporins and quinolones) and absence of fever at the time of presentation were excluded. However, this was a Randomized Controlled Trial study. Patients fulfilling the study criteria were admitted in the pediatric ward of Holy Family Hospital and were randomly divided into two groups, A and B, based on random numbers. Group A was given Inj.Ciprofloxacin 10mg/kg I/V twice daily, while group B was given Inj. Ceftriaxone 70mg/kg I/V once daily for 7 days. Both groups were observed for the duration of becoming afebrile (96hrs). The investigation to be done during hospital stay was typhidot (IgM antibodies) from the designated laboratory with the standard kit. However, the results were verified by the consultant pathologist. Data was analyzed using SPSS (V10). Mean and standard deviation were calculated for quantitative variables i.e. age and duration of getting afebrile. Frequencies and percentages were calculated for qualitative variables i.e. gender and getting afebrile in 96 hours. Consequently, chi-square test was used to compare the efficacy (afebrile in 96hours) of both drugs. P-value < 0.05 was considered significant.Result The study included 88 patients with febrile illness suspected of having typhoid fever on clinical grounds. Clinically, the patients had fever >37°C in the presence of at least one or more of the following sign and symptoms: Persistent headache, Abdominal pain or discomfort, Presence of splenomegaly / hepatomegaly, Rose spots on skin, vomiting, and no evidence of chest bowel urine or meningeal infection. Thus, all subjects were < 12 years of age. The age range was from 5 to 12 years with a mean age of 8.3±1.94 years. 41 (46.6%) were males and 47 (53.4%) were females. The weight of the children ranged from 14 to 41 kg with a mean weight of 24.7±6.3 kg. Furthermore, 15 (17%) used boiled water as a routine, while 73 (83%) used unboiled water as a routine.  Chi-Square Tests a Computed only for a 2x2 table b 0 cells (.0%) have expected count less than 5. The minimum expected count is 10.00.Discussion Enteric fever is a common illness of children and young adults. This magnifies the socio-economic impact of the disease on the community. The industrialized and more prosperous countries have, to a great extent, controlled this illness by improving standards of public health; but the disease continues to be a major public health problem in less developed countries including Pakistan. Therefore, the emergence of drug resistant strains of Salmonella has made the treatment of enteric fever more difficult. The last 2 decades have also witnessed the appearance and spread of multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains of S. typhi. Infection with these strains is associated with longer duration of illness and higher morbidity and mortality. Thus, it is occurring at higher incidence throughout South Asia than previously thought particularly in younger children. Enteric fever is a significant problem in the preschool years. Among children, 60% of cases are in the age group of 5 to 9 years, 27% between 2-5 years, and 13% between age group of 0-2 years. 208 After the emergence of chloramphenicol resistant Salmonella typhi strains, ciprofloxacin has become the choice of drugs for the treatment of typhoid fever even in the pediatric age group. The present study was carried out to compare the clinical efficacy of ciprofloxacin vs ceftriaxone in terms of the average time taken in the number of days for defevescence in the treatment of typhoid fever in children. Therefore, the study included 88 patients with febrile illness suspected of having typhoid fever. The mean age was 8.3±1.94 years and 41 (46.6%) were males. The mean weight was 24.7±6.3 kg. Only 15 (17%) used boiled water as a routine. 68 (77.3%) children in total became afebrile within 96 hours, while 20 (22.7%) failed to become afebrile in 96 hours. In the ciprofloxacin group, 25 (56.8%) patients became afebrile in 96 hours and 19 (43.1%) failed to become afebrile in 96 hours. In the ceftriaxone group, 43 (97.7%) patients became afebrile in 96 hours and 1 (2.3%) failed to become afebrile in 96 hours. Therefore, the proportion of patients becoming afebrile within 96 hours was significantly higher in the ceftriaxone group as compared to the ciprofloxacin group, p= 0.00. Our results thus differ from those of previous review, a summary of randomised controlled trials of enteric fever, which found fluoroquinolones to be superior to ceftriaxone for clinical failure and fever clearance times. Although these data suggest that fluoroquinolones had significantly lower fever clearance times compared with chloramphenicol, cefixime, and ceftriaxone, the analyses of fever clearance times must be interpreted with caution. The mean fever clearance times often follow a skewed distribution-although most patients clear fever quickly, some take much longer times-, so meta-analyses conducted using arithmetic means may not be accurate. However, the persistence of fever in some patients despite clearance of S Typhi and S Paratyphi from the bloodstream has been attributed to the continued production of pyrogenic cytokines. This suggests that time taken to clear fever may not be an adequate measure of antibiotic efficacy. Consequently, they may not be an appropriate end point in typhoid therapy trials. Some investigators also did not specify whether clinical failures were excluded or included in the calculations of mean fever clearance time. This may be due to the irrational use of quinolones even in minor infections. Hence, most of this includes viral fevers. This has resulted in increasing the resistance of S typhi to quinolones in our country. Appropriate treatment for enteric fever is a clinical and public health challenge, with rising levels of drug resistance and limited evidence for the use of newer agents, particularly for children. Large, well designed, and methodologically rigorous trials are needed to compare fluoroquinolones with first line antibiotics in community or outpatient settings. Hence, this reflects practice in low income countries, with accurate reporting of resistance data. Long term follow-up and monitoring of adverse effects are also required. Investigators must standardize definitions and time points of measurements of outcomes, particularly those with a subjective nature, such as clinical failure. In addition to objective studies of treatment efficacy and cost effectiveness, we need the evaluations of algorithmic approaches in the diagnosis and management of prolonged fever in children in regions where typhoid is endemic. Such protocols will guide antibiotic use and may curb rising resistance. A study at the Divisions of Clinical Medicine & Microbiology, National Institute of Cholera & Enteric Diseases (ICMR), Kolkata, India, evaluated the role of ceftriaxone therapy in bacteriologically confirmed MDR typhoid cases who did not respond to 12-14 days of ciprofloxacin therapy. Attempts have also been made to investigate the in vitro susceptibility of isolated S. typhi strains to chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, and ceftriaxone. A total of 140 children, aged 3-10 years, clinically diagnosed as having typhoid fever, without any clinical response after 12-14 days of ciprofloxacin therapy were screened for S. typhi by blood culture. In the bacteriologically positive children, the treatment was changed to intravenous ceftriaxone for 14 days. The isolated strains of S. typhi were tested for in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility. Clinical and bacteriological cure was observed with intravenous ceftriaxone therapy in all the 32 bacteriologically positive patients. All isolated S. typhi strains were uniformly (100%) susceptible to ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone. Thus, 50 percent of the strains were resistant to chloramphenicol. The MIC values of chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, and ceftriaxone ranged between 125-500, 0.0625-0.5 and < 0.0625 microgram/ml, respectively. The study indicates that although the S. typhi strains were susceptible to ciprofloxacin in vitro, the patients did not respond clinically and bacteriologically to ciprofloxacin therapy. Hence, ciprofloxacin may not represent a reliable and useful option for treating MDR typhoid fever; thus, ceftriaxone may be an effective alternative for the treatment of such cases. Typhoid fever is widely prevalent in developing countries, with an annual burden of millions of cases globally. At Lady Reading Hospital, Peshawar, a study on drug resistance in enteric fever was carried out in Paediatric ""A"" Unit. Inclusion criterion was positive blood and/or bone marrow culture. In total, 50 patients had positive culture for salmonella (blood in 26 patients and bone marrow in 49 patients). Organism isolated were salmonella typhi in 49 cases and salmonella paratyphi A in one case. The single isolate of S paratyphi A was sensitive to all the antimicrobials tested except cotrimoxazole. Out of 49 isolates of S typhi, only 5 (10.2%) were sensitive to all the primary anti-typhoid antimicrobials, while 44 (89.8%) were resistant to multiple drugs. All of the isolates here were fully sensitive to ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, while sensitivity to third generation cephalosporins varied between 57% and 79%. Inspite of in vitro resistance, 22 patients (44%) showed good clinical response to amoxycillin and chloramphenicol. In the remaining 28 patients (56%), response to the above drugs was poor, and they were started on ofloxacin (in children above 5 years of age) or third generation cephalosporins. Consequently, the response of the patients to these drugs was good with defervescence within 8 days after the start of treatment No significant effects of quinolones were noted in these children. They concluded that quinolones can be used in children above 5 years of age in multidrug -resistant typhoid fever. The rapid spread of multidrug resistant (MDR) typhoid fever has posed a great challenge for the treatment of these cases all over the world today. After the emergence of chloramphenicol resistant Salmonella typhi strains, ciprofloxacin has become the drug of choice for the treatment of typhoid fever even in the paediatric age group. Thus, study at Kolkata, India, evaluated the role of ceftriaxone therapy in bacteriologically confirmed MDR typhoid cases that did not respond to 12-14 days of ciprofloxacin therapy. They included 140 children aged 3-10 years. Therefore, they found that ciprofloxacin might not represent a reliable and useful option for treating MDR typhoid fever. In addition, ceftriaxone may be an effective alternative for the treatment of such cases. iConclusion Ceftriaxone is more effective in children with typhoid fever in terms of greater proportion of children becoming afebrile in 96 hoursReferences: Acharya G, Butler T, Ho M, Sharma PR, Tiwari M, Adhikari RK, et al.

Methods: Between January 2005 and February 2008, 38 patients underwent EVAR for an unruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. The first 20 consecutive patients (Group A) had standard EVAR while the last 18 patients (Group B) had EVAR with fibrin glue injection into the sac, regardless of type II endoleak's presence. Results: There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups concerning the surgical time and the time of X-ray exposure (Ps0.30 and 0.54, respectively). Type II endoleak rate was significantly higher in Group A compared to Group B (6 cases, 30% vs. 1 case, 5.5%, respectively, Ps0.05). Primary short-term clinical success was 95% and 100%, respectively. At 12 months, selective lumbar embolization was performed in two patients in Group A and in one patient in Group B. Patients in Group A had less computed tomography (CT) studies than patients in Group B (2.0 vs. 1.2, respectively, Ps0.024). Conclusions: Fibrin glue injection is a safe procedure and seems to reduce type II endoleak rates. Patients who received this procedure had fewer CT examinations, with reduced health-care costs.","Introduction Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) has developed as a less invasive surgical procedure by comparison with open repair (OR) in the management of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Randomized controlled trials have shown that the most important benefits of EVAR are lower perioperative morbidity and mortality rates and faster recovery time w1, 2x. However, new complications have emerged and type II endoleak represents the most common form, which is caused by retrograde flow in the aneurysm sac from aortic branch vessels, such as inferior mesenteric artery (IMA), lumbar arteries and also accessory renal arteries. The evolution of type II endoleak is still unclear; it is generally considered a benign complication but in some cases it is associated with sac enlargement and the consequent risk of rupture w3x. Anyway, type II endoleak requires a close computed tomography (CT) or duplex monitoring, and 10% of patients per year require secondary procedure w4x. Several techniques have been described to manage E-mail address: fetosato@hotmail.it (F. Tosato). type II endoleak, either percutaneous as coil embolization or surgical as with conversion to OR w5x. Preventing type II endoleak with an intraoperative simple procedure would be extremely useful in terms of effectiveness of aneurysm repair. The aim of this study is to analyze our experience with aneurysm sac embolization, made at the time of EVAR, with a hemostatic material, such as fibrin glue in terms of reduction of type II endoleak incidence.Materials and methodsStudy design Between January 2005 and February 2008, 144 patients were electively treated at our institution for unruptured AAA; 106 patients (74%) had OR while 38 (26%) received EVAR. A retrospective analysis was carried out considering the 38 patients (32 males and 6 females) who had EVAR. Clinical data were extrapolated from our database. Indications to EVAR were hostile abdomen due to previous laparotomies, severe cardiac and pulmonary co-morbidities which may determine high risk for OR, and visceral cancers in line for intervention in 9, 20 and 9 cases, respectively. F. Pilon et al. / Interactive CardioVascular and Thoracic Surgery 11 (2010) )20 mm). All patients with a visceral cancer in line for intervention were evaluated by the respective specialists and were defined as having a good prognosis and life The first 20 consecutive patients (Group A) had standard EVAR while the last 18 patients (Group B) had EVAR with fibrin glue injection into the aneurysm sac at the end of the procedure regardless of type II endoleak's finding. Demographic characteristics and risk factors of the two populations are reported in Table 1 . All patients underwent a preoperative abdomen contrastenhanced CT-scan with 3.0 mm slice thickness in order to evaluate the aneurysm's dimensions. All patients had a preoperative duplex scan in order to evaluate iliac occlusive disease, and an arteriography study was performed after identification of duplex scan abnormalities.Stent-graft procedure EVAR was performed in the operating room by a combined team consisting of a vascular surgeon and an interventional radiologist. All patients underwent general anesthesia and surgical exposure of both common femoral arteries. In Group A, EVAR was performed with bifurcated devices in 18 cases; in two cases mono-branch endografts in association with controlateral iliac occlusion and femoral-femoral bypass were executed due to a severe tight distal neck of the aneurysm. Fourteen Talent devices (Medtronic Vascular, Santa Rosa, CA, USA) and six Excluder devices (W.L. Gore and Associates, Flagstaff, AZ, USA) were used. Coil embolization of the hypogastric and the IMAs were performed in two cases preoperatively. In two cases, common iliac artery balloon angioplasty was carried out before introducing the endograft's branches. Adjunctive iliac extensions were released in two cases. In Group B, bifurcated devices were used in all cases: 12 Talent (Medtronic Vascular, Santa Rosa, CA, USA), five Excluder (W.L. Gore and Associates, Flagstaff, AZ, USA) and one Anaconda (Vascutek Ltd, Inchinnan, Renfrew, UK). Adjunctive iliac extensions were released in six cases, and the 'bell-bottom' technique was used in one case. During hospital stay, each patient received an abdominal radiography in order to verify the correct placement of the endograft. All patients underwent abdominal CT-evaluation 30 days post-surgery. At follow-up, patients with 30-day evidence of endoleak eventually underwent CT-control every six months until it regressed or at different time intervals if complications had emerged, while patients with no 30-day evidence of endoleak underwent CT annually. At our health-care facility, the expense concerning a single 2 or 5 ml dose of fibrin glue and a single platinum embolization coil is 170.00, 434.00 and 7380.00, respectively. Single abdominal CT study with 3D reconstruction and aorta plus femoral axes angiography costs 485.00 and 7866.00, respectively. Patients who underwent aortic branch vessel coil embolization as a secondary procedure received one day hospitalization, which globally determines a regional cost of 78053.50. The two groups of patients were analyzed in terms of surgical time, intraoperative X-ray exposure, number of postoperative CT studies (excluding those in the 30 days). The average cost per patient was also compared between the two groups, utilizing the previously described costs.Fibrin glue and aneurysm sac embolization technique The fibrin sealant used (TisseelyTissucol; Baxter Hyland Immuno AG, Vienna, Austria) is a biological mixture of purified, virus-inactivated human fibrinogen, human thrombin, and sometimes added components, such as virusinactivated human factor XIII and bovine aprotinin. These agents mimic the final steps of the physiological coagulation cascade to form a fibrin clot, which is slowly degraded by the body's fibrinolytic system w6, 7x. Thus, it constitutes a biodegradable tissue adhesive or sealant to stop or control bleeding or provide air and fluid solidification in many surgical situations w8x. During EVAR, after the main body of the graft is released and the contralateral gate is incannulated, catheterization of aneurysm sac is carried out by a standard 0.035-inch, 180 cm guidewire inserted in the same introducer. Then the introducer is removed and a 25-cm long 5-F Brite Tip introducer sheath is advanced over the guidewire into the sac and released in the wished position. Then the endograft is placed and modelled by a balloon angioplasty. A 'sarcogram' is then obtained by the 5-F Brite Tip introducer or by a standard angiographic catheter in order to localize the lumbar vessels. Depending on the angiographic output, the tip of the angiographic catheter is oriented toward the site of the possible type II endoleak and one or two 8=60 mm platinum embolization coils (Balt Extrusion, Paris, France) are inserted into the sac. Coil progression along the tip is accomplished by injection of normal salina, with consequent release of the coil into the sac. The next step involved removing the angiographic catheter and inserting a 25-cm long double-lumen Duplocath catheter mounted on a Duploject Y-connector along the sheath, until it reached the aneurysm sac. The latex balloon at the distal part of the iliac extension is inflated in order to prevent possible peripheral embolization of the fibrin sealant. Thus, with the balloon obstructing the vessel's lumen, 5-7 ml of fibrin glue were injected into the sac. The double lumen Duplocath catheter maintains separate the two components Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/icvts/article/11/1/78/724961 by TU Wien Bibliothek user on 02 June 2023  of the fibrin glue, making intermixing possible only inside the sac (Fig. 1 ). Final steps involved withdrawing the Brite-Tip introducer and performing an aorto-iliac angiographic scan to check the patency of the endograft. We decided to inject 7 ml instead of 5 ml and to put two coils instead of one into the aneurysm sac in the presence of a large AAA (diameter )60 mm) or when big calibre patent collateral vessels were observed during the sarcogram.Statistical analysis Continuous variables were expressed as means""standard deviation (S.D.); comparisons were carried out by standard t-test for normal variables and Mann-Whitney test for nonnormal ones. Statistical significance was established to exist when P-0.05 was found. Survival curves were generated with the Kaplan-Meier method. All analyses were performed with STATA and SPSS 13.0. Definition of technical and clinical success and description of complications were defined according to the current reporting standards for EVAR w9x.Results The populations of the two groups turned out to be homogeneous concerning the average aneurysm sac diameter (52.80""8.7 mm in Group A vs. 55.72""11.3 mm in Group B, Ps0.38), the number of patent aortic branch vessels (such as the IMA) and the couples of lumbar arteries (Table 2 ). In Group A, the average surgical time and X-ray exposure were 3.45""0.90 h and 30.02""8.57 min, respectively. The average number of abdominal CT studies per year was 2.0. Within 30 days no operative or aneurysm-related deaths and no complications requiring re-intervention were observed. One patient developed acute myocardial infarction with cardiac arrest and required ICU stay; he gradually got better and was finally discharged. Mean follow-up was 20 months (range 13-36 months). During follow-up an endograft's right branch occlusion required repair by femoral-femoral bypass (grade 3). One patient was submitted to renal artery percutaneous angioplasty due to a pre-existing severe stenosis. One acute pancreatitis was observed. There were two late deaths due to gastric cancer and leukaemia. There were no cases of aneurysm sac enlargement during the follow-up period. Type II endoleak was found at the end of EVAR in six cases (30%), always from a lumbar artery. Two disappeared spontaneously at 30-day CT control, one at six months and one at 12 months; in the remaining two cases persistence of type II endoleak after one year required lumbar artery selective coil embolization (10%). The average health-care cost per patient was estimated to be 71924.47""73014.28. In Group B, sac catheterization procedure and sudden fibrin glue injection was performed successfully in all patients. There were no early allergic or anaphylactic reactions. Five patients received a 7-ml dose of fibrin glue plus two embolization coils, while others received standard 5 ml plus one coil. The average surgical time and X-ray exposure were 3.12""0.61 h and 32.26""13.12 min, respectively. The average number of abdominal CT studies per year was 1.2. Within 30 days no operative or aneurysm-related deaths and no complications requiring re-intervention were observed. One patient with pre-existing chronic renal failure worsened and required dialysis (grade 2). The mean follow-up period was 18.5 months (range 12-25 months); no complications either those requiring reintervention or systemic ones were observed and all patients were alive. There were no cases of aneurysm sac enlargement. In one case (5.5%) a type II endoleak was found at the end of EVAR, coming from a patent lumbar artery, which required coil embolization after 12 months control with successful outcome. Average health-care cost per patients was 72031.02""72200.18. Technical success was 100% within both groups; shortterm clinical success was 95% in Group A and 100% in Group B. The comparison between the two groups (Table 3 ) showed a non-statistically significant difference concerning the surgical time and the time of X-ray exposure. The changes in aneurysm sac diameter after intervention are reported in Table 4 . There has been more considerable shrinkage among patients of Group B without type II endoleak finding, but without statistical significance. F. Pilon et al. / Interactive CardioVascular and Thoracic Surgery 11 (2010) Number of postoperative CT studies per year was significantly higher in Group A with respect to Group B and so was the rate of type II endoleak at the end of EVAR, even with Ps0.05. The health-care cost per patient was comparable between the two groups, greater in Group B but not statistically significant.Discussion Since EVAR has been introduced to manage AAA, type II endoleak has emerged as a frequent complication concerning this procedure. The incidence of type II endoleak has been reported to be variable, occurring in 6-17% of patients w10x, although it can be as high as 30% w11x. Contrary to type I and III, which have precise indications for aggressive treatment strategies, type II endoleak's natural history has not been clearly defined. Retrograde flow coming from aortic branch vessels is often considered a benign event but the treatment continues to be one of the most controversial topics of EVAR. It is true that the precise parameters that define the need for intervention have not been definitively established, but it should be noted that this event compromises overall effectiveness of aneurysm repair. Also, this complication requires close monitoring during follow-up-period and in some cases secondary intervention needs to be performed. Spiral CT is classically considered the gold standard for long-term evaluation of EVAR. It allows to determine if patent lumbar or IMA arteries are still supplying the aneurysm sac or if it is enlarging in diameter for other reasons. Moreover, CT monitoring is useful in cases of delayed type II endoleak, which have been found at the 12-month followup in 1-5% of patients submitted to EVAR w10x. New strategies have been recently introduced to diagnose type II endoleak following EVAR; colour-duplex scanning with contrast medium or magnetic resonance angiography. Some authors have proposed echo-colour-duplex scanning as a better method compared to CT for endoleak detection after EVAR w12x. The role of intraoperative intrasac thrombin injection in order to prevent type II endoleak has been evaluated w13, 14x. The surgical technique that we adopted was taken from the experience of Zanchetta et al. w13x . They found that fibrin glue sac embolization during EVAR can lead to a low rate of delayed type II endoleak and to a statistically significant decrease in the maximum diameter of the aneurysm sac. In our study some different technical devices have been introduced, such as the use of platinum embolization coils to optimize the organization of fibrin glue. The coils constituted a rigid matrix which facilitated fibrin solidification, as a new tissue around its skeleton; due to its characteristics, we believed a coil to be stronger than surgical wire as a framework around which a solidifying material is placed. Moreover, the adjustable angiographic catheter permitted to place the coils as near as possible to the source of retrograde flow. The Duplocath catheter has the same length as the 5-French introducer, therefore, the possibility of injecting fibrin glue upstream to sac lumen was avoided. These are helpful adjunctive devices considering the final outcome of the aneurysm sac embolization technique. Our experience comprised a small population of patients. The incidence of type II endoleak in Group A is comparable to the ones reported in literature and the rate of type II endoleaks in Group B is significantly lower with respect to Group A. The procedure is easily performed requiring a short time at the end of EVAR. Actually, the surgical time and the X-ray exposure in Group B were comparable to those encountered without this procedure. Preventing type II endoleak with this simple intraoperative procedure would be an extremely powerful achievement also in terms of reduction of health-care costs. In our limited experience, we noticed comparable costs during the follow-up period between the two groups, and a reduction in frequency of follow-up visits. Aneurysm sac embolization with fibrin glue results in an additional cost but the number of CT studies during the follow-up is reduced. Annual CT evaluation is necessary in any case, but patients with no 30-day post procedure evidence of a type II endoleak avoided the six months study, with a statistically significant reduction in the overall number of CT diagnostic evaluations. This results also in a reduction of the healthcare 'social' costs, because patients are less subject to frequent evaluations. All these aspects contribute to improving patients' satisfaction and compliance. Performing this procedure would additionally reduce the need for secondary procedures during follow-up. Our rate of secondary procedure among patients of Group A was comparable to the one reported in literature w10x. Consensus about this aspect has not been yet obtained; management of type II endoleak has been recommended when it persists after six months with an aneurysm sac enlargement )5 mm or when it persists after 12 months without an AAA sac enlargement w10, 15x. We recommend following these criteria in managing type II endoleak. Preoperative and intraoperative embolization of collateral aortic vessels is a laborious procedure that requires selective catheterization. We believe that it is easier to inject fibrin glue into the sac rather than embolize selectively all collateral vessels. In our experience the indication for prey intraoperative embolization of IMA, lumbar or hypogastric arteries exists when they have a particularly big calibre. Moreover, secondary procedures after EVAR, such as IMA or lumbar artery coil embolization, cause a considerable rise in the health-care charges; this is much more true in those cases in which conversion to OR cannot be avoided, due to failure of endovascular procedure or considerable growth of aneurysm sac. Intraoperative intrasac thrombin injection during EVAR is a safe and feasible procedure that does not cause a rise in operative time and X-ray exposure. There is a statistically significant decrease in type II endoleak rates among patients submitted to this procedure, which allows us to believe that it is essential in preventing this complication at the end of EVAR. This outcome refers to a small population of patients enrolled in the study but confirms data coming from other recent and larger experiences. Healthcare charges are comparable to those of other patients, but only in the absence of complications or secondary procedures. Larger populations should be studied in terms of costs to confirm these results.Fig. 1 . 1 Fig. 1.

However, there are no previously published randomized trials to measure the health impacts of large-scale sanitation programs. India's Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC) is one such program that seeks to end the practice of open defecation by changing social norms and behaviors, and providing technical support and financial subsidies. The objective of this study was to measure the effect of the TSC implemented with capacity building support from the World Bank's Water and Sanitation Program in Madhya Pradesh on availability of individual household latrines (IHLs), defecation behaviors, and child health (diarrhea, highly credible gastrointestinal illness [HCGI], parasitic infections, anemia, growth). Methods and Findings: We conducted a cluster-randomized, controlled trial in 80 rural villages. Field staff collected baseline measures of sanitation conditions, behaviors, and child health (May-July 2009), and revisited households 21 months later (February-April 2011) after the program was delivered. The study enrolled a random sample of 5,209 children ,5 years old from 3,039 households that had at least one child ,24 months at the beginning of the study. A random subsample of 1,150 children ,24 months at enrollment were tested for soil transmitted helminth and protozoan infections in stool. The randomization successfully balanced intervention and control groups, and we estimated differences between groups in an intention to treat analysis. The intervention increased percentage of households in a village with improved sanitation facilities as defined by the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme by an average of 19% (95% CI for difference: 12%-26%; group means: 22% control versus 41% intervention), decreased open defecation among adults by an average of 10% (95% CI for difference: 4%-15%; group means: 73% intervention versus 84% control). However, the intervention did not improve child health measured in terms of multiple health outcomes (diarrhea, HCGI, helminth infections, anemia, growth). Limitations of the study included a relatively short follow-up period following implementation, evidence for contamination in ten of the 40 control villages, and bias possible in self-reported outcomes for diarrhea, HCGI, and open defecation behaviors. Conclusions: The intervention led to modest increases in availability of IHLs and even more modest reductions in open defecation. These improvements were insufficient to improve child health outcomes (diarrhea, HCGI, parasite infection, anemia, growth). The results underscore the difficulty of achieving adequately large improvements in sanitation levels to deliver expected health benefits within large-scale rural sanitation programs.","Introduction The practice of open defecation is thought to be a major cause of the persistent worldwide burden of diarrhea and enteric parasite infection among children ,5 years old [1] . Reducing open defecation requires access to and use of improved sanitation facilities, which are defined as facilities that prevent human feces from re-entering the environment [2] . In 2010, an estimated 47% of the world's population did not have access to improved sanitation facilities. India alone accounts for a third of those without improved sanitation (814 million), nearly 60% of those who practice open defecation (626 million) [2] , and a quarter of the world's deaths from diarrheal diseases among children aged less than 5 years [3] . Observational studies of interventions that prevent human feces from entering the environment have been shown to reduce diarrheal diseases [4, 5] and enteric parasite infections [6] [7] [8] . Most of this research, however, has focused on the provision of sewerage systems in urban centers. Few studies have been conducted in rural areas of low-income countries where the provision and maintenance of networked sewerage is prohibitively expensive. Consequently, most government and donor financing in the rural sanitation sector focuses on the provision of non-networked toilets. Despite the wide scale deployment of such programs, to our knowledge there have been no published randomized trials to measure the effect of rural sanitation programs on diarrheal diseases, intestinal parasite infections, anemia, or growth in young children. The objective of this study was to measure the effect of India's Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC) in rural Madhya Pradesh on household availability of improved sanitation facilities as defined by WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) for water and sanitation [2] , open defecation behaviors of household members, water quality, and child health (diarrheal diseases, highly credible gastrointestinal illness [HCGI], enteric parasite infections, anemia, and growth). The TSC, scaled up to all districts in India and deployed to hundreds of millions of people, is possibly the largest rural sanitation program in the world. As a part of their Total Sanitation and Sanitation Marketing (TSSM) project, the Water and Sanitation Program (WSP; the World Bank) provided capacity building support to ten districts of Madhya Pradesh to strengthen the implementation of the program. In two of these ten districts, we studied the effects of the TSC implemented with support from the WSP under the TSSM project using a clusterrandomized controlled trial in 80 rural villages. We hypothesized that the program would increase availability of individual household latrines (IHLs) and reduce the practice of open defecation in a community through use of IHLs. On the basis of previous research [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] , we further hypothesized that less open defecation would: (i) reduce the quantity of feces in the environment that could contaminate shallow groundwater aquifers, water distribution networks, and soil in the community, and (ii) also reduce enteric pathogen transmission through flies, which are well-established vectors for transmission [9] [10] [11] . Conditional on improvements in these intermediate outcomes, we hypothesized that children ,24 months at enrollment in intervention villages would have a lower prevalence of diarrhea, HCGI, enteric parasite infections, and anemia when measured after the intervention. Finally, we hypothesized that the program would improve average weight-for-age and height-for-age in these young children as a result of fewer symptomatic and asymptomatic enteric infections over longer exposure periods to improved sanitation [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . The above hypothesized causal chain between the intervention and health outcomes is depicted in Figure 1 .MethodsEthics Statement The study is a part of larger six-country study commissioned by the WSP. The study protocol was approved by the Western Institutional Review Board, Olympia, Washington, USA (study number 1095420) and the Independent Ethics Committee, Mumbai, India (IEC/09/11). The survey respondents provided a verbal consent after enumerators apprised them of study objectives, use of collected information, confidentiality, risks, benefits, and respondent rights. Written consent was not obtained because of lower literacy and social norms that would deter women (child caregivers were the main respondents) from signing any document without her husband's or elders' permission. The protocol for the broader study was formally registered after the completion of fieldwork because at the time the study was conceived pre-registration was not a well-known convention in the field of development economics [17] (the study was originally conceived by PJG and colleagues at the World Bank). The team agreed that a late registration was better than none at all. The original study protocol-established in 2008; before the baseline survey-included another two districts from the state of Himachal Pradesh where the WSP provided support under their TSSM project as well [18] . However, the study in Himachal Pradesh was discontinued because it was impossible to retain a control group for the duration of the study period. The only substantive change to the protocol in Madhya Pradesh after the start of the trial was the increase in sample size planned for follow-up; we provide details in the section on Sample Size. The CONSORT checklist (Text S1) and the follow-up study protocol (Text S2) are provided as supplemental information.Trial Design The study design was a cluster randomized controlled trial with randomization at the village level and equal allocation to the two treatment arms. The study population included 80 villages from two neighboring districts in Madhya Pradesh: Dhar and Khargone. The villages randomized to the intervention group received the TSC program and villages in the control group did not receive the TSC until after the study. As a demand driven program, the district administration was duty bound to provide the program to the villages in the control group if they requested it and if the funding was available. The district administration agreed to provide the program to all control villages after the completion of the study. The study measured outcomes, anticipated confounders, and covariates at household and child levels both before and after the intervention in two survey waves. The follow-up survey was administered to the same households who participated in baseline data collection and additional households were included at follow-up (see the section on Sample Size for details).Study Population Table 1 describes population characteristics for the study region relative to the state and national population on the basis of India's 2011 Census. Overall, Madhya Pradesh is one of the less developed states of India, including its water and sanitation infrastructure. The study districts are more agricultural, with higher proportion of marginalized population groups and lower literacy than the state average, but with better water supply and drainage infrastructure. IHL coverage (percentage of households with access to IHL) in rural areas of study districts (19.2% in Dhar and 13% in Khargone) is comparable to the state average (13.1%) but much worse than the country average (30.7%). The IHLs are predominantly the types included in the JMP definition of improved sanitation [2] . On average the IHL coverage across India increased by approximately 10% between 2001 and the 2011 Census. However, the change in the IHL coverage between 2001 and 2011 varied widely between states and between districts within each state [19] . Study villages were selected in collaboration with the Madhya Pradesh state government. Madhya Pradesh is divided into 50 districts, 313 Blocks, and 23,040 Gram Panchayats (referred to as ''villages'' in this manuscript). A Gram Panchayat is the smallest Indian administrative unit and has a local elected body. The 80 study villages were the independent units selected in three steps. First, through a series of meetings and site visits, the state government and the WSP selected two of 50 districts in Madhya Pradesh: Dhar and Khargone. Second, 11 of 13 Blocks from Dhar and eight of nine Blocks from Khargone were selected for the study. The remaining Blocks were excluded from the sample frame because all villages from these Blocks were earmarked for the TSC program, precluding the enrollment of control villages. Third, in each administrative Block the government identified villages where they were amendable to randomizing the TSC program. In each of the 80 study villages, the field team listed and mapped 200 households and randomly selected 25 households with at least one child ,24 months of age at enrollment. If a village had multiple sub-villages, then to avoid spreading the sample too thin, the survey team selected the most populous two to three sub-villages for the listing purposes. From the numbered list of eligible households, a random starting number was chosen and thereafter every n th household number was selected where n was determined by dividing eligible number of households by 25. For the follow-up survey we increased the sample size of households per village from 25 to 38 (see section on Sample Size). Additional 100 to 150 households were listed and mapped before the followup survey to select additional households. Figure 2 summarizes loss to follow-up in the original cohort and recruitment of new households in the follow-up survey. Because we conducted the follow-up survey 21 months after baseline, the eligibility criteria for newly enrolled households was that they had at least one child between the ages of 21 months and 45 months and were living in the village at the time of the baseline survey to be commensurate with the eligibility criteria for the original cohort. Child caregivers were the main survey respondents, but household heads or other elders occasionally answered questions related to household characteristics.Intervention Program India's TSC, initiated in 1999, was an ambitious program with a goal to eliminate the practice of open defecation in India by 2012. In 2012, the government transformed TSC into a new program named Nirmal Bharat Abhiyaan (Clean India Campaign). The TSC included subsidies for and promotion of IHLs that can safely confine feces (similar to JMP defined improved sanitation facilities), school sanitation and hygiene education, Anganwadi (preschool) toilets, and community sanitation complexes. The TSC also supported rural sanitary marts and production centers to provide good quality but affordable material for toilet construction. Additionally, the TSC included several features such as ongoing social mobilization and behavior change activities at state, district, and village levels, flexible technology options for toilets, and a community award called the Nirmal Gram Puraskar (NGP) given to communities that were determined to be ''open defecation free''-defined as a community where all households have and use IHLs that can safely confine feces-and meet all of the other ''total sanitation'' requirements defined by the Indian government. The NGP awards ranged from Rs 50,000 (US$1,000) to Rs 500,000 (US$10,000) for villages, up to Rs 2,000,000 (US$40,000) for Blocks, and Rs 5,000,000 (US$100,000) for districts. In Madhya Pradesh, the TSC was implemented with a concurrent program named Nirmal Vatika (Clean House) under the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme to provide additional financial and material subsidies to households. TSC and Nirmal Vatika together provided at least Rs 4,200 (US$84) to below poverty line (BPL) households in the village. The Indian Ministry of Rural Development classifies households as BPL using characteristics such as land holdings, house type, consumer durables, and literacy [20] . BPL households were identified in this study by their ration card color (a document used to access public food and grain distribution system). While the TSC provided subsidy of Rs 2,200 (US$44) to BPL households, Nirmal Vatika provided additional at least Rs 2,000 (US$40) to BPL and non-BPL households both to support IHL construction. These costs were determined by the government to be adequate to construct an offset two-pit latrine with water sealed squat plate and a brick walled room (which will be a JMP defined improved sanitation facility), and this type of latrine was actively promoted in the study districts. Beginning in 2006, the WSP India office supported the TSC program under the TSSM project in ten districts in Madhya Pradesh. The WSP worked with local authorities to create an enabling environment for the TSC activities, to develop local implementation capacities at the district level, and to support the use of monitoring systems to assess progress towards the TSC goals. WSP promoted and provided capacity building support to implement community-led total sanitation (CLTS) based behavior change methods [21] . The CLTS methodology involves a series of community ''triggering'' exercises, led by an external facilitator after building rapport with the community in the pre-triggering phase, which highlight the magnitude of the practice of open defecation, elicit shame and disgust, and mobilize community action to end open defecation [21] . These triggering activities are followed by community follow-up actions that are supported by facilitators. Although the intervention used CLTS based tools for behavior change, it cannot be considered as a classical CLTS intervention. CLTS principles require that no hardware subsidies be provided to individual households and specific latrine models not be prescribed [21] , whereas the intervention provided hardware subsidies to individual households to build offset pit latrine designs approved under the Nirmal Vatika program. Provision of hardware subsidy as a post-construction incentive was advocated by the WSP, but the mechanisms of the convergence of Nirmal Vatika and the TSC essentially meant that the subsidies were released before and during but rarely after IHL construction. The TSC program in the study areas was implemented by the village government (Gram Panchayat) with support from district and block administration personnel or consultants. The study investigators and staff were not involved in program implementation.Outcome Definition and Measurement The study measured outcomes using a combination of structured questionnaires and observations, sampling and testing of drinking water, child anthropometry and specimen (stool and blood) testing. GfK Mode Pvt Ltd. was contracted to conduct the fieldwork. Training and all field activities were overseen by the study investigators (SRP, ALS). The baseline survey was conducted between 25 May and 18 July, 2009, and the follow-up survey was conducted between 23 February and 25 April, 2011. Questionnaires used in the follow-up survey were the same as those used in the baseline survey with some additional questions to measure program exposure and outcomes. The household questionnaire collected information about household socioeconomics, demographics, exposure to the TSC activities, water and sanitation infrastructure, sanitation-and hygiene-related behaviors, and health/diseases. Interviewers conducted standardized spot-check observations of dwelling sanitation and hygiene facilities. Defecation behavior was reported by adults during private, in-home interviews. Main outcomes were defined as follows. Toilets, open defecation, hygienic conditions. We classified household sanitation facilities using questions and definitions proposed by the JMP [2] . JMP-defined improved sanitation includes flush/pour flush toilet connected to piped sewer, to septic tank or to offset pit, ventilated improved pit latrine, on-pit latrine with slab and composting toilet that can hygienically separate human excreta from human contact. However, it is possible that the households build rudimentary latrines that are not included in the JMP definition of improved sanitation. For example, in addition to no facility or open defecation, the JMP defined unimproved sanitation facilities include flush toilets disposing waste elsewhere, pit latrine without a slab (open hole), bucket latrine, and hanging latrine. We also report availability of all types of IHLs whether improved or unimproved to assess whether the households moved up the sanitation ladder from no facility to some type of latrine even if unimproved. To assess defecation behavior for men, women, and children (,5 years), interviewers asked households separately for each group whether they openly defecate daily/always, occasionally/seasonally, or never. Interviewers also asked about child feces disposal using the standard JMP question [2] ; disposal in a toilet, a confined pit, or buried was classified as hygienic. Field staff also observed whether the IHLs (of any type if present) were being used on the basis of worn path, closable door, odor, anal cleaning material, and water to flush. Field staff also recorded any observed human or animal feces in the household living area. Caregiver reported illness. The study's primary outcome was diarrhea and HCGI among children ,5 years old. We defined diarrhea as $3 loose or watery stools in 24 hours, or a single stool with blood/mucus [22] with a 7-day recall period [23] using a previously published instrument [24] . HCGI-a more inclusive measure of enteric infection-was defined as any of the following four conditions: (1) diarrhea; (2) vomiting; (3) soft or watery stool and abdominal cramps occurring together on any day; or (4) nausea and abdominal cramps occurring together on any day [25] [26] [27] [28] . We measured respiratory symptoms (constant cough, pulmonary congestion, difficulty breathing, breaths per minute) and defined acute lower respiratory illness (ALRI) as constant cough or difficulty breathing and a raised respiratory rate [29] . We also measured bruising/abrasions and itchy skin/scalp to serve as negative control outcomes [30] to check for differential reporting bias in this unblinded trial [31, 32] . Anthropometry. We measured children ,24 months at enrollment for height, weight, and mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) using a standardized anthropometry protocol [33, 34] . Pairs of trained anthropometrists measured child length/height to the nearest 0.1 cm using a portable stadiometer (manufacturer: Seca); children ,24 months were measured in the recumbent (lying) position and older children (at follow-up) were measured standing. Weight was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg using an electronic scale (manufacturer: Tanita); children unable to stand were weighed in their caregiver's arms and the caregiver's weight measured separately. MUAC was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm using a pediatric measuring tape. All measurements were collected in duplicate and we used the average of the two measurements in the analysis. We excluded observations if the two measurements differed by .10% (n = 21 [0.48%] for height, n = 85 [1.93%] for weight, n = 23 [0.52%] for MUAC). We converted the anthropometric measurements into Z-scores using the WHO's 2006 growth standards and the WHO publicly available Stata algorithm [35] . Anemia. If the caregiver provided informed consent, trained field staff conducted an in-field test for anemia for children between the ages of 6 and 60 months using HemoCue (HemoCue Ltd). We classified children as severely anemic if their hemoglobin concentration was ,7.0 g/dl, moderately anemic if their hemoglobin concentration was 7.0-9.9 g/dl, and mildly anemic if their hemoglobin concentration was 10.0-11.9 g/dl [36] . Parents of children who were severely anemic were advised to visit the nearest health facility for medical attention. Water quality. We collected 100 ml stored drinking water samples from a random sample of 404 households in the intervention and 403 households in the control groups, and also collected paired samples from the water source from which the households collected their drinking water (511 source samples). The water samples were collected in sterile containers, labeled, and individually packed in a sterile plastic zip-lock cover provided by the laboratory. The sample collectors were provided with sterile gloves and trained to avoid cross-contamination of water and containers. Water samples were stored and transported in ice boxes and tested for Escherichia coli using membrane filtration (100 ml volume filtered) within 36 hours of collection at Envirocare Laboratories Pvt Ltd, Mumbai. The laboratory used HiCrome Agar (M1466) by HiMedia. Each incubation batch included positive and negative control plates. Positive colonies of E. coli were further confirmed with Triple Sugar Iron (TSI) agar test and group of Indole, Methyl red, Voges-Proskauer, and Citrate tests (IMViC). Samples below the lower limit of detection were imputed at 0.5 colony forming units (CFU) per 100 ml (half the limit of detection [37] ), and samples beyond the upper limit of detection were imputed at the limit of detection (200 CFU/ 100 ml). Child stool parasitology. At the follow-up survey, we selected a random subsample of 1,150 households from 3,039 households and collected a stool specimen from the oldest child between 21 and ,60 months of age. All stool samples were preserved in 10% formalin and analyzed at the National Institute for Cholera and Enteric Diseases in Kolkata. Lab technicians tested the samples for soil transmitted helminthes (Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, Ancylostoma duodenale, and Necator americanus) and tapeworm helminthes (Hymenolepis nana, Taenia sp., Diphyllobothrium latum) using the Kato-Katz technique [38] . A separate aliquot was analyzed to test for protozoan infections (Giardia lamblia, Cryptosporidium sp., Entamoeba histolytica) using a commercially available ELISA kit (TechLab) [39, 40] . All specimens were tested with a combination of microscopy, ELISA, and PCR to achieve high levels of sensitivity and specificity. If a child tested positive for one of the protozoan infections using either microscopy or ELISA, the result was confirmed using isolated DNA from the ELISA positive samples followed by PCRrestriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) methods for genotyping local isolates of giardia (b-giardin) [32] , Cryptosporidium (18s rRNA) [33] , and E. histolytica (SSU rRNA) [34] . If a sample tested positive by microscopy or ELISA but was not confirmed by molecular methods then the sample was classified as negative.Sample Size The study was originally designed to have 80% power to detect a 4.5 percentage point reduction in diarrhea prevalence among children ,5 years old assuming 15% prevalence in the control group (or a 30% relative reduction) with a two-sided alpha of 5%, and an intra-class correlation of 0.105 [41] . These assumptions led to a design with 40 clusters (villages) per arm and 25 households with children ,24 months per cluster. After the commencement of the study but without knowledge of any study outcomes, we decided to additionally power the trial to detect differences between groups in height-for-age Z-scores on the basis of a hypothesis published on the possible effects of improved hygiene and sanitation on child growth [14] . We reviewed measures of variability and within-cluster correlation of height-for-age Z-scores (SD = 2.09, intra-class correlation = 0.17), and chose to increase the within-cluster sample sizes from 25 to 38 households to ensure the study had 80% power to detect differences of +0.2 Z in heightfor-age.Randomization The village-level randomization was stratified at the administrative Block level because the TSC implementation was coordinated at the Block level and we wanted to ensure that the treatment arms were evenly allocated between districts and geographically stratified within districts. The randomization took place in a public lottery led by study investigators. The Block TSC coordinators or their representatives picked the lottery ticket that assigned villages to treatment groups. Overall, we allocated a total of 20 villages in each district to the intervention and 20 to control (40 villages per arm). The program implementers and researchers were not blinded to the group assignment. Field interviewers were not informed of group assignment, but it was possible for them to identify intervention villages during interviews of Block officers or the village secretary.Statistical Methods We checked the baseline balance in the observable characteristics of the randomized groups. Due to highly comparable groups at baseline and the large increase in our within-cluster sample between baseline and follow-up, our analysis focused on group comparisons post-intervention (using follow-up measures only). To evaluate any differential effect of attrition (loss to follow-up) between baseline and follow-up, we compared baseline characteristics of those present at follow-up with those lost to follow-up. We also compared the balance of baseline characteristics across treatment groups for individuals who were present at both baseline and follow-up to determine whether attrition was differential by treatment group. Our parameter of interest for all outcomes was the mean difference between randomized groups. We conducted the analysis using households and individuals as they were randomized (intention to treat [ITT]). We estimated differences between groups using the following linear regression model: Y ijk ~azbT j zdX ij zb k z"" ijk ð1Þ Where, Y ijk is the outcome for individual i in village j and Block k; T j is the intervention indicator (1 for intervention, 0 for control); X ij are individual, household, and village level characteristics used in adjusted analyses; b k are indicator variables for Blocks since randomization was stratified at the Block level; and e ijk is the error term. The parameter b estimates the ITT difference between the randomized groups. In the adjusted analyses, we included the following covariates to improve precision: whether the household head had attended school; whether the government categorized the household as Scheduled Caste or Tribe; child age; and child sex. Additionally, the adjusted models included three baseline characteristics found to be slightly imbalanced between groups despite randomization. These included: percentage of households in the village that used improved water sources; percentage of households in the village that were observed to have soap and water at the hand-washing place used after defecation; and mean height-for-age Z-score of children in the village. To further assess differential impacts of the program by important population subgroups, we re-estimated the effect of the intervention for households with and without IHL (any type) at baseline, and households below the official poverty line and the other households. Since we would expect behaviors and child health outcomes to be correlated within villages, all estimates used Huber-White robust standard errors for the parameter b clustered at the village level [42] and reported p-values for the two sided t-test. Following guidance from Schulz and Grimes [43] , we did not adjust p-values or confidence intervals for multiple comparisons because many of the outcomes were highly correlated with one another (for example, correlation between primary outcomes diarrhea and HCGI = 0.78); nominal p-values should be interpreted with this in mind. All analyses were conducted using Stata v12 (Statacorp), and all primary analyses were independently replicated by two investigators (SRP, BFA) from untouched datasets to final estimates.Access to Protocol and Data The study protocol, questionnaires, and access to data collected in the study are available upon registration at http://microdata. worldbank.org/. 2 , baseline covariates in intervention and control groups were well balanced with four exceptions. First, 89% of the households in the intervention group had access to improved water sources-tap/piped water, tube well and protected dug wells-compared to 80% of households in the control group. In contrast, a larger proportion of control households (54%) were observed to have soap and water at hand-washing locations used after defecation than in intervention households (44%). On average, more children were found to be anemic in the control group (93%) than in the intervention group (88%). Finally, average height-for-age Z-scores were also slightly imbalanced (21.38 intervention versus 21.81 control).ResultsEnrolment, Baseline Balance, and Attrition Attrition was not differential by randomized group on the basis of observable characteristics (see Table S1 ). Of the 1,954 households enrolled at the baseline, 1,655 were located at the 21-month follow-up survey (15% attrition) without any significant difference between the intervention (16%) and the control (15%) groups. Characteristics remained balanced between intervention and control groups in remaining households.Compliance to Randomization The study measured intervention implementation in multiple ways because of the complexity of the TSC program. These measures included: reported implementation by Block coordinators, expenditure of funds documented by official program records, and interviews with local village officials. Out of 40 intervention villages, staff collected administrative information on 39 villages from the TSC Block coordinators (government officers). The coordinators reported that 15/39 intervention villages received some CLTS activities, 33/39 villages applied for a NGP award prior to the follow-up survey. According to Block coordinators' records, 25/39 villages had 100% households with IHLs, 11/39 villages had 80%-99% households with IHLs, and three of 39 villages with 37%-68% households with IHLs. Block coordinators also reported that 21/39 villages received 100% of the funds allocated under the TSC program, 12/39 villages received between 50% and 99%, and six of 39 villages received , 50% of their allocated funds. The latest disbursement of the TSC funds was given to 36/39 intervention villages at least 4 to 5 months before the follow-up survey, which would offer sufficient time for IHLs to be constructed and used for 3 or more months. The study review meetings with Block coordinators also identified that some control villages were contaminated during the study period: TSC activities were initiated in eight control villages within a few months of baseline survey and possibly in two additional control villages a few months prior to the follow-up survey; official records were not available for control villages to ascertain this information objectively. As per the follow-up survey in these ten contaminated villages, the household level coverage of JMP defined improved sanitation facilities increased from 17.4% at baseline to 41.4% at the follow-up, which is similar to the program effect we observed in the intervention group. The household level coverage of JMP defined improved sanitation facilities in uncontaminated control villages increased from 10.7% to 16.2% in the same period. The study's long follow-up period (21 months) and the highly publicized and politicized nature of the TSC program may have contributed to this contamination. Information from additional sources (village secretaries, school teachers, Anganwadi [pre-school] workers in the village, and the rapid assessment from random sample of households) confirmed that TSC activities translated into a higher recollection and knowledge of the TSC program in the intervention villages compared to the control villages. We also found that households in intervention villages were more aware of CLTS activities, had higher knowledge of TSC, and experienced more personal visits to convince them to build and use IHLs (Table 3 ).IHL Coverage and Sanitation-Related Behaviors Table 3 reports the intervention's effect on IHL availability (JMP defined improved sanitation facilities and any type of IHLs) and open defecation behaviors by household members. The intervention increased the coverage of JMP defined improved sanitation facility by average 19 percentage points (95% CI 12%-26%; p-value,0.001) in intervention villages compared to control villages (41.4% intervention versus 22.6% control). The intervention increased the coverage of any type of IHL facility by 20 percentage points (95% CI 13%-27%; p-value,0.001) in intervention villages compared to control villages (44.1% intervention versus 24.2% control). These results indicate that available IHLs were predominantly JMP defined improved sanitation facilities and very few rudimentary latrines or latrines defined as unimproved by the JMP were built. These results are consistent with the TSC design that promoted latrine models that can safely contain the feces. Although on average fewer households in intervention villages were likely to report daily open defecation compared to control villages for adult men (75% intervention versus 84% control; mean difference: 9.5%; p-value = 0.001), adult women (73% intervention versus 83% control; mean difference: 10%; p-value,0.001), and children ,5 years (84% intervention versus 89% control; mean difference: 5%; p-value = 0.014), these reductions in reported open defecation behaviors were smaller than the gains in IHL availability. Amongst the 630 households in intervention villages that had JMP defined improved sanitation facilities at follow-up, 41% reported that adult men or women still practiced daily open defecation; this same figure was 28% among the 339 control village households at follow-up (not reported in results table). A follow-up debriefing question to households who had IHL identified that the main reasons for daily open defecation in spite of having IHL were culture, habit, or preference for defecating in open followed by inadequate water availability.Drinking Water Quality In control villages, 82% (331/403) of household drinking water samples tested positive for E. coli compared to 77% (310/404) of samples in intervention villages (mean difference: 5.5%; pvalue = 0.050) (Table 3 ). Table S2 lists the distribution of positive household samples by different E. coli contamination level categories. Of 511 water source samples tested, 74% (208/280) of the sources in control villages and 70% (162/231) in intervention villages tested positive for E. coli but the difference was not statistically significant ( p-value = 0.143).Caregiver Reported Illness Diarrhea prevalence did not differ between groups (7.4% intervention versus 7.7% control; p-value = 0.687) (Table 4 ). HCGI prevalence also did not differ between groups (11.5% intervention versus 12.0% control; p-value = 0.692) (Table 4 ). We observed no significant differences between groups in negative control caregiver-reported outcomes including bruising/abrasions (1.4% intervention versus 1.3% control) and itchy skin/scalp (2.5% intervention versus 2.2% control) suggesting that differential outcome reporting bias for diarrhea and HCGI was unlikely.Enteric Parasite Infections In the subsample of 1,150 children with stool collection, 5.7% (66/1150) had helminth infections and the majority (50/66) were Ascaris infections. All remaining infections were tapeworms; no children were infected with T. trichiura or hookworm. We observed no difference in helminth prevalence between intervention and control groups. Giardia infection was common, and consistent with slightly improved water quality in the intervention group, we found lower Giardia prevalence among children in intervention villages (18%) compared to children in control villages (23%) (mean difference: 4.8%; p-value = 0.047). We detected no Cryptosporidium infections in the study children, and a low prevalence of E. histolytica (33 out of 1,150; 2.9%).Anemia and Anthropometry Anemia was prevalent in the study children (54%) and children were small according to international growth standards (Table 4 ). However, we found no differences between the randomized groups in anemia prevalence or growth outcomes.Subgroup Results Table 5 presents the results of subgroup analyses of the effect of the intervention on households with or without any type of IHL at baseline and BPL or non-BPL households. As expected, the program had the largest improvements on JMP defined improved sanitation facilities, IHL use as assessed by enumerators, andDiscussion The TSC program, implemented with support of the WSP in Dhar and Khargone districts, increased household level coverage of JMP-defined improved sanitation facilities by a modest 19 percentage points in intervention villages compared to control (41% intervention versus 22% control; p-value,0.001). However, the reductions in reported open defecation by adults were even more modest: falling 9 to 10 percentage points (among men: 75% intervention versus 84% control; p-value = 0.001; among women: 73% intervention versus 83% control; pvalue,0.001), while reports of correct child feces disposal increased because of intervention by 9 percentage points (27% intervention versus 18% control; p-value,0.001). The availability of IHL and the reductions in open defecation were higher in the BPL household or households without any IHL at the time of baseline but we did not find consistent improvements in the multiple health outcomes in these subgroups. The less than universal or very high levels of IHL coverage in the intervention villages combined with relatively small behavior changes are consistent with our finding of no improvements in child health outcomes including: diarrhea, enteric parasite infection, growth, and anemia. The number of observations used to estimate means of the intervention and the control groups is the same as the number of observations used in ITT-unadjusted analysis. b Explanatory variables in the unadjusted model include the treatment assignment and indicator variables for Blocks. Therefore, the ITT effects for outcomes may not be exactly the difference between the listed mean in intervention and control groups in previous columns. c Because of missing adjustment variables data, the observations used in adjusted analysis are fewer than those used in unadjusted analysis. d Following the commonplace norms, statistical significance is indicated as: **significant at a = 0.05; *significant at a = 0.10. Please note that p-values are not adjusted for multiple comparisons following guidance from Schulz and Grimes [43] . e For children less than 60 months of age. f For children less than 60 months of age.

BMI, body mass index; Hb, hemoglobin; HH, household; OD, open defecation. doi:10.1371/journal.pmed.1001709.t004 The study's findings should be viewed as a measure of effectiveness for this specific implementation of India's TSC program in rural Madhya Pradesh. By the end of the study in the intervention group, coverage of JMP defined improved sanitation facilities in a village ranged between 5% and 79% households and percentage of households in a village reporting daily open defecation by adult men ranged between 32% and 97% and that by adult women ranged between 34% and 97%. It is unknown whether enteric pathogen risk is linearly or non-linearly related to the level of improved sanitation in a community, and the intervention did not achieve the goal of universal availability of IHLs or universal elimination of open defecation during the study period. Therefore, our findings cannot speculate the child health outcomes for universal or higher levels of IHL availability or larger open defecation reductions that may be feasible under different contexts, program designs, or implementation efficacy. Additional, forthcoming cluster randomized sanitation intervention trials [44, 45] may generate such evidence if they can achieve adequately high latrine coverage and proportional reductions in open defecation. This study presents a cautionary tale of how difficult it can be to achieve universal IHL coverage or elimination of open defecation for scaled up rural sanitation programs. The study documented clear evidence of more social mobilization, exposure to behavior change activities, and IHL construction in intervention villages compared to control villages. However, these intermediate outputs of the TSC could not translate into high enough levels of IHL availability and reductions in open defecation practice to deliver the health impacts. This evaluation was a part of a broader sixcountry effort to also study large-scale sanitation promotion programs in rural Indonesia and Tanzania, as well as large-scale hand-washing promotion programs in Peru, Vietnam, and Senegal. While the Tanzania results are forthcoming, the Indonesia study found even smaller increases in availability of JMP defined improved sanitation facilities and reductions in open defecation following a large-scale sanitation campaign [46] that was similar in design to the classical CLTS approach [21] . A recent cross-sectional survey in Orissa found more optimistic results-72% IHL availability following the TSC [47] -but implementation was heterogeneous. Much less than universal levels of IHL coverage and use were reported in past evaluations of pilot programs and early implementations of India's TSC [48, 49] . Within the broader water-sanitation-hygiene sector, the difficulty of scaling up interventions that are efficacious when widely adopted and properly used across a community is not unique to rural sanitation. Evaluations of large-scale hand-washing promotion campaigns in Peru and Vietnam-part of the broader research effort that included the present trial-found almost no improvements in hand-washing behavior and thus no downstream impacts on child health [50, 51] . Furthermore, the interim evaluation of the national-level Sanitation Hygiene Education and Water supply in Bangladesh program found very small improvements in hygiene and sanitation outcomes, with no impacts on child health [52] . The present evidence from the sector suggests that with few exceptions [53] scaled up sanitation and hygiene programs in rural settings have had difficulty in delivering the health benefits measured in small efficacy studies. Typically, the well-controlled efficacy trials can result in high enough levels of sanitation and hygiene infrastructure and behaviors necessary to deliver the health benefits, but the same levels of infrastructure or behavior change are not guaranteed to accrue to large-scale programs. From a public health perspective, these findings call into question the likelihood of the TSC in its current form to improve child health. Still, the program may be valuable from the policy and development perspective for reasons beyond public health, such as the social benefits of sanitation (dignity, privacy, safety, and reduced burden of coping especially for women) accrued to households that have and use IHLs, and the obligation of the government to provide access to sanitation as a recently recognized human right by the United Nations General Assembly (Resolution number 64/292). As the next iteration of the TSC program-named Nirmal Bharat Abhiyaan (Clean India Campaign)-continues, research efforts that focus on how to significantly increase the access to and use of IHLs would be particularly valuable to guide future program refinement. High levels of IHL coverage and use should be demonstrated in pilot programs before these program refinements are taken to national scale.Limitations Like other effectiveness studies that measure the impact of largescale government programs, we faced the challenges typically not encountered in well-controlled efficacy trials such as imperfect compliance with treatment assignment and poor fidelity of intervention implementation. We found that by 21 months of follow-up, none of the intervention villages achieved the program goal of 100% households having and using IHLs that can safely confine feces; the average household level coverage of JMP defined improved sanitation facilities was 40% (range: 5%-79%). The reasons for the gap between the officials monitoring records of the TSC and the actual status are discussed elsewhere [54] . The Block coordinators also identified that at least eight and possibly ten control villages received the TSC program. ITT estimates of program impacts with imperfect compliance will underestimate the effect possible under perfect compliance. Another challenge in trials where study investigators have limited control over the program implementation, is significant deviations in the actual implementation timeline compared to the timeline on which the evaluation study is based. While the planned follow-up period from the baseline was 18 months in this study, the actual follow-up measurement at 21 months was the latest possible point we could measure outcomes under the possibility of program expansion into control villages and contractual constraints with the evaluation funding. Although it was possible that impacts on diarrheal diseases could begin relatively soon after intervention, as documented in short-duration efficacy trials [55] , we would expect impacts on enteric parasite infection, anemia, and growth to potentially accrue more slowly. The limited length of follow-up could have also influenced our estimates of the program's effect on IHL availability and use. Longer follow-up could have led to potentially higher levels of IHL coverage or, conversely, lower levels of use (if IHLs are not maintained). Despite this limitation, our estimates of IHL coverage and reported use are broadly consistent with other independent measures following rural sanitation programs in India [47] [48] [49] . For example, Barnard and colleagues [47] found that 4 to 6 years after TSC implementation in Orissa that 53% of households with an IHL reported some individuals still practiced open defecation. In the present study, 41% of men and 38% of women from the intervention group who have JMP defined improved sanitation facilities reported practicing daily open defecation. Self-reported outcomes can be subject to differential, biased reporting in unblinded trials [31, 32] . Therefore, in addition to selfreported illnesses, we included several objective child health measurements in this study (parasite infections, anemia, anthropometry). However, we did not include objective measures of sanitation behaviors (disposal of child feces, IHL use, and open defecation). To the extent that our measurements of reported outcomes were subject to courtesy bias, we may have overestimated IHL use or under-estimated open defecation prevalence in the study population. Furthermore, if the bias was differential by treatment group, then we would expect the study to have overestimated the improvements due to intervention because we would expect the intervention households to be more sensitized to the stigma of open defecation. Measures of IHL use could be improved in future sanitation studies through the use of passive sensors mounted in the latrine [56, 57] .Generalizability There is wide variation in TSC implementation within India, and it remains possible that the TSC program was more or less successful in other states [19] . We note, however, that very few Indian states had large growth in IHL availability between 2001 and 2011 when the TSC program was active across India. In Madhya Pradesh, the TSC program was combined with Nirmal Vatika that served to increase the IHL construction subsidies available to all eligible households. Additionally, the districts enrolled in this study received support from the WSP's TSSM project to build capacity for creating an enabling environment, record keeping and monitoring, and implementing CLTS-based behavior change approaches. Therefore, the behavior change approaches in the study districts were arguably more intensive than those in the rest of Madhya Pradesh. However, this study should be not viewed as an evaluation of the CLTS approach as advocated by its practitioners [21] because the intervention only used CLTS behavior change tools and did not follow the key principles of CLTS such as not providing hardware subsidy and not prescribing latrine models.Conclusions This 80 village study in rural Madhya Pradesh represents the first published large-scale, randomized evaluation of India's TSC to measure and report outcomes at all stages of the causal chain (Figure 1 ). While the TSC program in rural Madhya Pradesh implemented with support from the WSP increased the household level availability of JMP defined sanitation facilities (+19%) and to a lesser extent reduced open defecation (210%), these improvements were insufficient to improve child health outcomes (diarrhea, parasite infections, anemia, growth). Despite the limitations of the present study, including short follow-up and evidence for contamination in the control group, the results underscore the challenge of achieving adequately large levels of improvements in sanitation to deliver the expected health benefits within the scaled-up rural sanitation programs.Editors' Summary Background. Diarrheal diseases are linked with the deaths of hundreds of thousands of young children each year in resource-limited countries. Infection with enteric pathogens (organisms such as bacteria, viruses, and parasites that infect the human intestine or gut) also affects the health and growth of many young children in these countries. A major contributor to the transmission of enteric pathogens is thought to be open defecation, which can expose individuals to direct contact with human feces containing infectious pathogens and also contaminate food and drinking water. Open defecation can be reduced by ensuring that people have access to and use toilets or latrines. Consequently, programs have been initiated in many resource-limited countries that aim to reduce open defecation by changing behaviors and by providing technical and financial support to help households build improved latrines (facilities that prevent human feces from re-entering the environment such as pit latrines with sealed squat plates; an example of an unimproved facility is a simple open hole). However, in 2011, according to the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation, more than 1 billion people (15% of the global population) still defecated in the open. Why Was This Study Done? Studies of sewerage system provision in urban areas suggest that interventions that prevent human feces entering the environment reduce diarrheal diseases. However, little is known about how rural sanitation programs, which usually focus on providing standalone sanitation facilities, affect diarrheal disease, intestinal parasite infections, anemia (which can be caused by parasite infections), or growth in young children. Governments and international donors need to know whether large-scale rural sanitation programs improve child health before expending further resources on these interventions or to identify an urgency to improve the existing program design or implementation so that they deliver the health impact. In this study, the researchers investigate the effect of India's Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC) on the availability of individual household latrines, defecation behaviors, and child health in rural Madhya Pradesh, one of India's less developed states. Sixty percent of people who practice open defection live in India and a quarter of global child deaths from diarrheal diseases occur in the country. India's TSC, which was initiated in 1999, includes activities designed to change social norms and behaviors and provides technical and financial support for latrine building. So far there are no published studies that rigorously evaluated whether the TSC improved child health or not. What Did the Researchers Do and Find? A cluster randomized controlled trial randomly assigns groups of people to receive the intervention under study and compares the outcomes with a control group that does not receive the intervention. The researchers enrolled 5,209 children aged under 5 years old living in 3,039 households in 80 rural villages in Madhya Pradesh. Half of the villages (40), chosen at random, were included in the TSC (the intervention). Field staff collected data on sanitation conditions, defecation behaviors, and child health from caregivers in each household at the start of the study and after the TSC implementation was over in the intervention villages. A random subsample of children was also tested for infection with enteric parasites. The intervention increased the percentage of households in a village with improved sanitation facilities by 19% on average. Specifically, 41% of households in the intervention villages had improved latrines on average compared to 22% of households in the control villages. The intervention also decreased the proportion of adults who self-reported open defecation from 84% to 73%. However, the intervention did not improve child health measured on the basis of multiple health outcomes, including the prevalence of gastrointestinal illnesses and intestinal parasite infections, and growth. What Do These Findings Mean? These findings indicate that in rural Madhya Pradesh, the TSC implemented with support from the WSP only slightly increased the availability of individual household latrines and only slightly decreased the practice of open defecation. Importantly, these findings show that these modest improvements in sanitation and in defecation behaviors were insufficient to improve health outcomes among children. The accuracy of these findings may be limited by various aspects of the study. For example, several control villages actually received the intervention, which means that these findings probably underestimate the effect of the intervention under perfect conditions. Selfreporting of defecation behavior, availability of sanitation facilities, and gastrointestinal illnesses among children may also have biased these findings. Finally, because TSC implementation varies widely across India, these findings may not apply to other Indian states or variations in the TSC implementation strategies. Overall, however, these findings highlight the challenges associated with achieving large enough improvement in access to sanitation and correspondingly large reductions in the practice of open defecation to deliver health benefits within large-scale rural sanitation programs.

Children, especially school-age children, are more at risk of infection. Efforts need to be made to prevent the effects of worms. Prevention can be done through a promotive approach. This observational study with a pre-posttest and cross-sectional approach is aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of health education on healthy and helminthic behavior and analyzing the impact of helminthiasis on the deficit in the diet and children's learning achievement. The number of samples is 60 students from five grade 3 and 4 elementary schools in North Pontianak, West Kalimantan. The sampling technique was carried out by proportional random sampling. Worm infection in elementary school students was 16.7%, anemia was 55%, and learning achievement scores were less than the average grade of 55%. There was a significant difference in health counseling towards a decrease in the worm number (p = 0:046). There was a significant relationship between healthy living behavior and helminthiasis (p = 0:005). There was a significant relationship between helminthiasis and anemia (p = 0:017). There is a relationship between helminthiasis and learning achievement in elementary school children (p = 0:017). There is a relationship between anemia and learning achievement (p = 0:005). It is necessary for public health centers to provide treatment services for worms and health education about the effects of helminthiasis on health and learning achievement. The school should provide hand washing facilities in schools, and parents should play an active role in improving clean and healthy lifestyle habits at home.","Introduction Public health service efforts, including those carried out through health education, should include nutritional status improvement and disease control [1] . Disease control in Indonesia experiences an epidemiological transition. On the hand, there is an increase in noncommunicable diseases such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus and in workplace accidents. On the other hand, there have not been any infections such as malaria, dengue fever, and worms [2] . Health problems caused by helminthiasis are still a public health problem [3, 4] . The WHO predicts the prevalence of helminthiasis to reach 2 billion people in the world, and in the case of children, the prevalence is expected to reach 61,300,000. In India, the prevalence in school-aged children is between 12.5 and 66% [4, 5] . In Indonesia, after a stool examination survey in elementary school children, helminthiasis was found to have a prevalence of 25%, and in Semarang, it was found to have the same prevalence of 25% [5, 6] , whereas in North Sumatra, worm infection in children aged 1-5 years is 34.4% [7] . The types of worms that are found to contaminate elementary school children are mostly Ascaris lumbricoides, Ancylostoma duodenale, and Trichuris trichiura [4] [5] [6] [7] . The high prevalence of helminthiasis in school-aged children is due to a lack of personal hygiene in elementary school children, poor personal health habits, such as doing activities that are more related to land, not wearing footwear while playing, and not washing hands and nails, and the poor environment of home and school sanitation [2, 7, 8] . Symptoms of mild helminthiasis in children are nausea, diarrhea, and reduced appetite. Children who are heavily infected can experience impaired food absorption (malnutrition), lack of enthusiasm, and reduced concentration in learning. Children infected with Ascaris lumbricoides worms will show characteristics such as a distended abdomen, pale eyes, frequent stomach pain, and reduced appetite [9] . Long-term helminthiasis in school-age children will cause disturbances, such as pain, laziness to go to school (absenteeism), and reduced nutritional status [5, 9] . Malnutrition in children will cause lethargy, anemia, and lack of enthusiasm for learning [10] . In severe and chronic infections causing children to experience malnutrition, physical growth and cognitive development can be interfered with [11] . Children will be intellectually disturbed, because of lack of nutrient intake (malnutrition), characterized by a decrease in the ability to learn and process new information, which results in children having difficulty developing their thinking power [10, 11] . Malnutrition can occur in children who have worm infections because the nutrients needed by the body are absorbed by the worms so that children experience nutritional anemia [11] . The incidence of nutritional anemia, due to deficiency in iron, folic acid, and/or vitamin B12, is rooted in inadequate nutrient intake, low bioavailability, and still high helminthiasis [11] [12] [13] . The impact of anemia, especially in school-age children, will result in paleness, fatigue, weakness, and decrease in antibody and reduced abil-ity or concentration in learning. Children with anemia have a lower index of psychomotor development than healthy children [14] . Generally, their school performance is lower than that of normal children [15, 16] . At present, helminthiasis control based on elementary school children is still limited and rare. Government control, which is carried out by local community health centers, is limited to using a treatment approach. For this reason, efforts with a promotive approach to health and preventive counseling by improving clean and healthy living behaviors, as well as knowing the effects of helminthiasis such as anemia and poor learning achievement, can be known to reduce helminthiasis in elementary school children.Materials and Methods 2.1. Research Design. This type of research is observational with a pre-posttest and cross-sectional approach. The aim of the research is to look at the description of health education variables, clean and healthy behavior, helminthiasis, and a deficit in diet related to the condition of anemia in children and learning achievement and then to analyze the relationship between these variables. This research was conducted on grade III and IV elementary school children in North Pontianak. 1 ). The sampling of elementary school students is based on the combination of the location of primary schools in urban areas (01 and 09) and elementary schools located on the outskirts of the city (32, 33, and Hidayatullah elementary schools). In accordance with the statistical formula, the number of samples is 60 students.  There are two types of data in the study, namely, primary and secondary data. Primary data is taken directly by researchers in elementary schools, including data on worms and anemia. Secondary data include semester learning achievement data and characteristics of elementary school children, taken from documents held by elementary school students.Subjects andData Collection. The data collected included fecal retrieval and examination (helminthiasis), implementation of health education, assessment of clean and healthy behavior, blood tests (anemia), and learning achievement. Data collection research was conducted in 3 stages. In the first stage, perform an examination of feces (worms) and blood hemoglobin, evaluate the value of learning achievement, and assess clean and healthy living habits. The second stage is the implementation of health education for elementary school children (grades III and IV). After the following week, health counseling was carried out again for the second time. In the third stage, after one month of intervention, the reexamination of feces (worms) and assessment of clean and healthy living behavior was carried out for students in grades III and IV and data on student achievement was collected. The research was conducted from January to August 2016.Fecal Examination. Study participants were given a clean labeled stool container containing 10 mL of 10% formalin. Toilet paper and clean sticks were given to collect the morning feces specimen the following day. Each child is instructed to bring their feces so that mixing does not occur. After collecting the stool specimens, they are immediately processed using a simple smear and the Kato-Katz thick smear technique. Sellotape slides were observed directly under a microscope for helminth eggs; then, identification was carried out. Hookworm, Trichuris trichiura, and Ascaris lumbricoides eggs were counted. The 10% subsample is used for quality control.Blood Tests (Identification of Anemia). Hemoglobin examination is carried out by the cyanmethemoglobin method. A 10 μL blood sample is put into a 2.5 mL bottle of Drapkin solution (a chemical or substance used for chemical analysis or synthesis), using a pipette, and then put into a serology tube, followed by gentle shaking until smooth; the solution is left for 3-5 minutes at room temperature; the photometer is read at a wavelength of 546 nm; and the results printed on the device screen are observed.Results Anemia is a disease that is caused by lack of iron, folic acid, and vitamin B12 in the body which causes the formation of reduced hemoglobin. Iron deficiency anemia is also affected by the consequences of helminthiasis with chronic blood loss. From Table 1 , it can be seen that 63.3% are mostly males. 16.7% of the respondents experienced helminthiasis, most respondents (55%) had anemia, the value of learning achievement was mostly below average (55%), and the clean and healthy life behavior is mostly good (51.7%). With regard to the education of parents of students, 50% of the mothers and 41.7% of the fathers had primary school education, and with respect to the work of the head of the family, most of them (53.8%) are farmers. From Table 2 , there is a difference in the proportion of helminthiasis between before and after the implementation of health education in primary school students, namely, 16.7% and 10%. Statistical analysis showed a significant difference between the proportions of helminthiasis between before and after the provision of health education in elementary school children in North Pontianak (p = 0:046). In Table 3 , it can be seen that there is a tendency for school students who have poor hygiene and healthy behavior (31%) to be more infected with helminthiasis than those who have good hygiene and healthy behavior (3.2%). The results of the statistical tests showed that there was a significant relationship between clean and healthy habits with helminthiasis in elementary school children in North Pontianak (p = 0:005). In Table 4 , it can be seen that there was a tendency for respondents who were infected with helminthiasis to have 3 Journal of Parasitology Research anemia (90%), greater than those without worms (48%). Statistical analysis showed a significant association between helminthiasis and the incidence of anemia in primary school children in North Pontianak (p = 0:017). From Table 5 , it can be seen that there is a tendency for respondents infected with helminthiasis to have learning achievement below the mean (90%) greater than those who are not infected with helminthiasis (48%). From the results of statistical tests, there was a significant relationship between the incidence of helminthiasis and the learn-ing achievement of elementary school children in North Pontianak (p = 0:017). From Table 6 , it can be seen that there is a tendency for respondents who have anemia to have less learning achievement (63.6%) greater than those who are not anemic (44.4%). The results of the chi-square statistical analysis showed that there was a significant relationship between anemia and the learning achievement of elementary school children in North Pontianak (p = 0:005).DiscussionWorms in Elementary School Children. The proportion of helminthiasis in elementary school children in North Pontianak Subdistrict was 16.7%. This result is lower than the results of an examination of elementary school children in Indonesia with 25% proportion of helminthiasis. Also, our result is low when compared with the results of research in elementary school children in other places, for example, 25% in Semarang and 34.5% in North Sumatra [6, 7] . The low number of helminthiasis in elementary school children in North Pontianak is due to the existence of health care programs through school health efforts. The health services include providing worm medicine and hand washing facilities from the community health center of the Pontianak City Government [4, 17, 18] . The impact of helminthiasis on elementary school children is very serious in terms of both health status and learning achievement [5, 9] . This can be seen from the results of research in Pontianak showing a tendency for health problems and a decrease in learning achievement. Table 1 shows that the majority of respondents (elementary school children) in North Pontianak were anemic by 55% and learning achievement qualifications were below the average of 55%. Children who at the time of school are in the anemic condition usually tend to be lousy or physically unfit and get easily drowsy and tired. As a result of conditions like this, children are lazy to take lessons and concentration and passion for learning decrease [14, 15] . These conditions result in decreased learning achievement so that learning outcomes are below the average class.Health Education, Clean Behavior, and Worm Infestation. The proportion of helminthiasis in schoolchildren is higher before health education is conducted compared to after the implementation of health education. Health education is carried out to improve the understanding and improvement of knowledge and attitudes and behaviors of a clean and healthy life [4, 17] . Interventions with health education are intended to provide motivation to elementary school children to improve clean and healthy living behaviors so that they can prevent helminthic disorders through the use of environmental health facilities at school and at home. Health education interventions are aimed at improving clean and healthy attitudes and behavior and are useful for increasing community participation through clean and healthy living behaviors to prevent the occurrence of helminthiasis [18, 19] . In addition, health education interventions can be carried out with the aim of improving medical behavior such as going to health services (community health centers) for treatment. In addition, it can also be used to improve clean and healthy lifestyle, such as the habit of washing hands after using the toilet or before eating [20] . Thus, the provision of health education is expected to reduce the incidence of helminthiasis. For this reason, it is recommended that in addition to providing treatment for schoolchildren who are detected with worms, prevention should be also done through regular and routine health counseling for schoolchildren, especially elementary school children. By providing health education, a clean and healthy life behavior will increase, resulting in excellent health conditions, good academic performance, and a clean and healthy environment [21] . The better the behavior of a clean and healthy life, the smaller the occurrence of helminthiasis. For this reason, health education efforts to improve healthy living behavior, especially for schoolchildren, need to be done [21, 22] , for example, the habit of cleaning hands and nails, defecating using latrines, and washing hands before eating. Efforts to improve clean and healthy living behavior can be done through an intervention approach to the efforts of local health services (community health centers) and physical environment control [18, 19] . Health service interventions by community health centers in schools should make students and parents aware of the importance of health care facilities, especially for helminthiasis control. Community behavioral or habitual interventions are intended to increase people's awareness and habits of the importance of clean and healthy lifestyle, while controlling the physical environment is done to provide awareness of the importance of a healthy environment, such as the habit of defecating into healthy latrines. This is expected to be useful to prevent the occurrence of illness and transmission of diseases, especially helminthiasis in elementary school children [21, 22] .Helminthiasis, Anemia, and Student Learning Achievements. Helminthiasis experienced by children especially in elementary school-age children will have a serious influence on their health status and also their learning achievement [5, 9] . Schoolchildren with helminthiasis are anemic by 90%, greater than those without worms. Anemic children will easily get tired and sleepy, and their learning passion will diminish [10] . When schoolchildren are lazy and less passionate about learning, consequently their learning achievements decline [23] . Children who are infected with helminthiasis in the long term will experience a shortage of nutrient intake because the nutrients needed by the body are absorbed by the worms so that children experience anemia. Worm infections can cause chronic bleeding by sticking to the intestinal wall and eating  5 Journal of Parasitology Research tissues and blood. Blood loss occurs because of blood being sucked by worms and because of bleeding and damaged mucosa, such as Ancylostoma Duodenal which causes blood loss of 0.14-0.4 ml and Necator Americans can reduce blood from 0.01 to 0.4 ml [24] . 1 ml of blood loss will result in iron loss of 0.5 mg, resulting in blood loss of 3-4 ml/day (1.5-2 mg iron), and can result in a negative balance of iron. Blood loss in schoolchildren is caused by helminth infestations, which attack the proximal small intestine and suck blood from the intestinal submucous veins [23, 24] . Children with anemia have a lower index of psychomotor development than healthy children [25] . Children with low Hb (anemia) have a low learning ability, and their school performance is also lower than that of normal children [26] .Conclusion Most students infected with helminthiasis experience anemia and experience a decrease in learning achievement. There are differences in the proportion of helminthiasis between before and after public health counseling. There is a significant relationship between PHBS and helminthiasis. There is a relationship between helminthiasis and anemia and between anemia and learning achievement in children, and there is a significant relationship between helminthiasis and learning achievement in children, especially primary school children. It is recommended for public health centers to prevent helminthiasis in primary school-age children, in addition to providing medical services such as worm medicine. Besides that, it is important to do health education about the impact of helminthiasis on health status and learning achievement. The school is expected to provide understanding about the effects of helminthiasis on health and sanitation facilities and hand washing facilities in schools. For parents, they are expected to play an active role in reminding clean and healthy lifestyle habits at home such as encouraging children to wear footwear when doing activities outside the home, washing hands before eating, and washing hands after using the toilet.Figure 1 : 1 Figure 1: Research location map.The method of selecting samples is done by proportional random sampling for five primary schools in North Pontianak. The distribution of each elementary school is based on the number of students in grades III and IV. The number of samples for each elementary school is 15 students for 01 public elementary school, 6 students for 09 public elementary school, 11 students for 32 public elementary school, 16 students for 33 public elementary school, and 12 students for Hidayatullah elementary school. The sampling of students in grades III and IV of each primary school is done by a simple random sampling technique.2.4. Research Instrument.The instruments used in this study are centrifuges for fecal examination (worms), Hb meters for blood measurement or examination (anemia), and grade III and IV report cards collected by tracking school documents for learning achievement data and characteristics of schoolchildren. Data on clean and healthy behavior is determined by observation with a checklist. 2 Journal of Parasitology Research 2.3. Sampling.The study protocol was reviewed by the Health Education Ethics committee and given ethical permission. Official permission was obtained from the ethics committee Poltekkes Kemenkes Pontianak in West Kalimantan with the number 017/KEPK-PK.PKP/I/2016. Written approval was obtained from all parents of students and the school and Pontianak City Health Service. 2.6. Data Analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney proportional difference test used to ana- lyze the effectiveness between before and after health counseling with a decrease in helminthiasis. The chi-square test was conducted to see the relationship between clean and healthy behavior and helminthiasis, analyze the link between helminthiasis and anemia, and evaluate the relation- ship between helminthiasis and anemia with learning achievement, with α = 5%. 2.7.

We aimed to determine whether a community-based WASH program had additional benefits in reducing STH infections compared with community deworming alone. We conducted the WASH for WORMS cluster-randomized controlled trial in 18 rural communities in Timor-Leste. Intervention communities received a WASH intervention that provided access to an improved water source, promoted improved household sanitation, and encouraged handwashing with soap. All eligible community members in intervention and control arms received albendazole every 6 months for 2 years. The primary outcomes were infection with each STH, measured using multiplex real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. We compared outcomes between study arms using generalized linear mixed models, accounting for clustering at community, household, and individual levels. At study completion, the integrated WASH and deworming intervention did not have an effect on infection with Ascaris spp. (relative risk [RR] 2.87, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.66-12.48, P = 0.159) or Necator americanus (RR 0.99, 95% CI: 0.52-1.89, P = 0.987), compared with deworming alone. At the last follow-up, open defecation was practiced by 66.1% (95% CI: 54.2-80.2) of respondents in the control arm versus 40.2% (95% CI: 25.3-52.6) of respondents in the intervention arm (P = 0.005). We found no evidence that the WASH intervention resulted in additional reductions in STH infections beyond that achieved with deworming alone over the 2-year trial period. The role of WASH on STH infections over a longer period of time and in the absence of deworming remains to be determined.","INTRODUCTION Soil-transmitted helminths (STHs)-comprising Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm (Necator americanus, Ancylostoma duodenale, and Ancylostoma ceylanicum), Trichuris trichiura, and Strongyloides stercoralis-are intestinal parasites that infect more than 1.45 billion people worldwide, 1 with a burden of more than three million disability-adjusted life years. 2 Soiltransmitted helminths are transmitted through the fecal-oral route, or by direct skin penetration in the case of hookworm and S. stercoralis. Soil-transmitted helminth infections are therefore more common in poor countries and communities where sanitation is lacking, water access deficient, and hygiene poor. 3 Chronic and high-intensity STH infections have been associated with significant morbidity, including malnutrition, and in the case of hookworm infections, iron-deficiency anemia that may be associated with poor maternal and cognitive outcomes. 4 Present World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines advocate for large-scale regular deworming campaigns with anthelmintic drugs (albendazole or mebendazole) that are safe and highly effective against A. lumbricoides and moderately effective against hookworm infections. 5, 6 Deworming campaigns for STH control have mainly targeted school-aged children because the adverse health effects of STH infection disproportionately affect children, and school-based delivery of anthelmintic drugs has operational advantages. 6 However, there is an emerging body of evidence suggesting that expanding deworming campaigns to include entire communities has the potential to achieve interruption of transmission, possibly leading to elimination, 7 is cost-effective, 8 and may be more beneficial for children. 9 Although deworming programs are effective at killing adult worms in infected individuals, in the short term, they have limited impact on transmission, especially if they only target children. Poor hygiene practices coupled with environmental contamination with parasite infective stages can result in rapid reinfection, and consequently, treatment needs to be repeated periodically. 10 Therefore, water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) interventions have been proposed as an important complementary intervention to deworming for sustainable STH control, given that these interventions can effectively separate humans from their feces, thereby reducing transmission. 11 Although there are several observational studies suggesting an association between individual WASH components and decreased STH infection, 12 there have been few intervention studies demonstrating the benefits of WASH on STH infections, particularly when delivered at the community level. The impact of individual and combined WASH components implemented in schools has been reported to reduce STH infections. [13] [14] [15] [16] However, the two trials on community-based sanitation (in the context of the Indian Total Sanitation Campaign) published so far did not detect reductions in STH infections arising from the sanitation intervention, possibly because of low latrine coverage and usage in intervention communities. 17, 18 Here, we report the results of WASH for WORMS, the first cluster-randomized controlled trial (RCT) aiming to determine whether a community-based WASH program has additional benefits in reducing STH infections when compared with community deworming alone, in the context of a highly endemic country. 19MATERIAL AND METHODS Full description of the trial setting and methods, including additional details regarding the intervention, sample size calculation, and randomization, can be found in the previously published protocol. 19 Setting, study design, and participants. We conducted a two-arm cluster RCT in 18 communities in Manufahi municipality, Timor-Leste, where WaterAid Australia, an international nongovernmental organization (NGO) implements its WASH projects in partnership with local NGOs. At the time the study was implemented, there was no ongoing deworming program in Timor-Leste-the ""Lumbriga. . .Mak Lae Duni"" (Worms, no way!) program initiated in 2005 was discontinued in 2008 because of the lack of funding and was planned to restart in selected municipalities in 2015. Our initial cross-sectional surveys found that the prevalence of N. americanus in study communities was 60% and that of Ascaris spp. was 24%. 20 Briefly, the WASH intervention consisted of the following components: 1. Improving water supply and working with residents over a period of up to 10 months, usually culminating in building of several tap stands per community, with the maximum distance between each dwelling and collection point of 200 m (or less than 5 minutes round trip walking time). Most of the water supply systems built were gravity fed, with groundwater supply systems built when there were no elevated water sources available. Microbiological tests were performed to guarantee water quality. 21 2. Promoting improved household sanitation by increasing demand. Improved sanitation options are as per the Joint Monitoring Program definitions. This used a strategy based on the community-led total sanitation (CLTS) process, whereby following a 1-2 day ""triggering"" meeting, residents committed to ending open defecation in their community by constructing and using household latrines. 22 The most common types of latrine that residents built, with explanations provided by WaterAid and partners, were simple direct pit latrines and offset pit pour-flush latrines. Squat slabs were either precast or made from local timber or compacted earth. Usually, a shelter made of local materials was also constructed. 3. Encouraging handwashing with soap at critical times: before preparing food, before feeding children, before eating, after using the toilet, and after cleaning a child's bottom. Hygiene promotion activities were conducted by community hygiene promoters from local partner NGOs, using a variety of information, education, and communication materials such as flip charts, games, songs, and posters. This was conducted through community meetings, smaller group meetings for women and children, and household visits. The community hygiene promoters visited communities approximately three times a month for 4-6 months, initiating just after the ""triggering"" meeting. All clusters in both study arms received the deworming intervention as follows: 400 mg albendazole was delivered to all eligible members of a community (residents older than 1 year of age, excluding pregnant women in the first trimester), and taken under direct observation, every 6 months for a period of 2 years, for a total of five deworming rounds. In the intervention arm, the first distribution occurred shortly after 80% of the households had built a latrine, as assessed by the local NGOs monitoring the WASH intervention. This happened 2-6 months after the triggering meeting. In the control arm, we waited a similar amount of time between the baseline survey and the first albendazole distribution. A 2-year follow-up period was selected by taking into account the following: 1) average life expectancy of STH eggs and larvae 3 and 2) logistical difficulties of following communities for longer time periods, given expected overall improvements in WASH conditions due to economic development and migration from rural to urban centers. Furthermore, a 2-year time frame was considered policy relevant, given that the impact of deworming on STH infections is detectable in such time frames 9 ; this trial aimed to assess whether there would be an additional benefit from WASH while deworming was taking place. The control clusters received the WASH intervention at the end of the trial. Ethics statement. This study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committees at the University of Queensland (2011000734), Australian National University (2014/311), and the Timorese Ministry of Health (2011/51). The trial is registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (registration number 12614000680662). Because of logistical and human resource constraints, it was registered after the baseline surveys were conducted (but before the measurement of study outcomes). The same primary outcomes were specified in the registration as in the ethics protocols that were approved before study commencement. The study was managed throughout according to protocols developed before data collection. General information about the trial was given to the community during a community meeting that took place after random allocation to intervention and control arms and before baseline data collection. Detailed verbal and written information was provided to individual participants during subsequent house-to-house visits. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants aged 18 years or older and from parents or guardians for those younger than 18 years. Participants aged 12-17 years provided written assent. Randomization and masking. Informed by our sample size requirements, WaterAid provided a list of 24 eligible clusters to be enrolled in the study, which were randomly allocated to intervention and control arms by A. C. A. C. and S. V. N. using a computer random number generator. 19 Inclusion criteria were as follows: having a suitable water source (e.g., a spring with capacity to provide water for the entire community) and having poor access to clean water and sanitation as determined by the Timorese municipality water and infrastructure office, and therefore being eligible for assistance from WaterAid. Five of these communities (two intervention and three control) had to be replaced during the enrollment process because of not meeting the necessary criteria: unsuitable water source (completely or partially dried out), proximity to intervention clusters (control), unwillingness to comply with the 2-year waiting period to receive the WASH intervention (control) or with building the water system (intervention), and small size. Replacement of each cluster was performed sequentially, one by one, as soon as they were deemed ineligible, using a list of replacement communities. Therefore, this process did not allow for random allocation to a study arm. WaterAid selected which cluster (community) to include as needed, accounting for geographical location and suitability of water source. One intervention community was subsequently lost to follow-up because the identified water source was no longer suitable for the water intervention, leaving 18 communities that followed the randomization protocol-nine intervention and nine control communities. Considering the five replacement clusters that were not randomly allocated, 23 communities in total completed the study. Because of the nature of the intervention, masking of clusters was not possible, and both participants and the research team were aware of the allocation. Contamination was minimized by making sure that communities were geographically well separated. However, by the third follow-up visit (18 months after baseline), three control clusters had been exposed to government-led sanitation promotion interventions. Procedures. In each of the communities, baseline parasitological, clinical, and sociodemographic surveys were conducted no longer than 4 weeks after the initial community meeting, before any component of the WASH intervention was in place. Similar surveys were repeated at each 6 monthly follow-up for 2 years, except for the clinical surveys, which were repeated annually. Each survey was completed before albendazole administration. All residents of the participating clusters who were older than 1 year at the time of each visit were eligible to participate in the study and were recruited during house-to-house visits. A fecal sample was obtained from each participant in a plastic container distributed the previous day, and processed by the research team no longer than 4 hours after collection. 19 For preservation, stool aliquots were mixed with 5 mL of 5% potassium dichromate and sent to the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute (Brisbane, Australia) for molecular diagnosis by multiplex real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to identify and quantify infections with each STH (Ascaris spp., N. americanus, Ancylostoma spp., T. trichiura, and S. stercoralis). 23 During the clinical surveys, we measured height and weight of participants younger than 18 years, to calculate anthropometric indices used as proxies for malnutrition. These were computed as Z-scores and included weight-forage for participants aged 1-10 years (to measure underweight), height-for-age (stunting) and body mass index (BMI)-for-age (thinness) for individuals aged 1-18 years, and weight-for-height (wasting) for participants aged 1-5 years. 24 The 2006 WHO database for child growth standards was used to calculate Z-scores, defined as the number of standard deviations (SDs) in relation to the mean of the standard population, with Z-scores less than two defined as malnutrition. 25, 26 We also tested for anemia by measuring hemoglobin (Hb) concentration in all age groups, using a finger-prick blood sample and a portable analyzer. Hemoglobin values were adjusted for altitude, and anemia was diagnosed based on WHO cutoffs for age, gender, and pregnancy status. 27 Individual participants (or caregivers for young children), heads of household, and community leaders were interviewed to collect sociodemographic characteristics including age, gender, education, employment, income, and assets, as well as history of diarrhea and deworming. Questionnaires also included self-reported WASH-related practices (ownership and use of latrines, defecation practices, availability of water, and hygiene behaviors), to assess changes related to the WASH intervention. When a household latrine was reported, study field-workers directly observed the latrine and assessed its cleanliness. 19 Outcomes. The primary outcomes were infection with each STH (Ascaris spp., N. americanus, Ancylostoma spp., T. trichiura, and S. stercoralis), measured every 6 months at the 4 follow-up surveys. Secondary outcomes, also measured at each 6 monthly follow-up, included Ascaris spp. and N. americanus infection intensity as determined by qPCR, and intensity category (higher intensity, lower intensity, or no infection). Intensity of infection was categorized based on the cycle threshold (Ct) values obtained by qPCR using the following approach: 1) Ct values were converted to qPCR intensity using the equation provided by the RotorGene Q software (qPCR intensity = 10 -0.298*Ct + 9.81 ); 2) the median intensity for all positive samples at baseline was calculated; and 3) individuals having qPCR intensity values higher than the baseline median were classified as ""higher intensity"" infections, whereas individuals with PCR intensity values lower than the baseline median were classified as ""lower intensity"" infections. This method allowed us to assess relative changes in higher versus lower intensity infections at each follow-up, compared with the baseline distribution in a population that had not been exposed to mass deworming in the previous 5 years. Other secondary outcomes, measured at 12 monthly intervals (second and fourth follow-ups), were as follows: adjusted Hb concentration and presence of anemia; weightfor-age, height-for-age, BMI-for-age, and weight-for-height Z-scores; and presence of underweight, stunting, thinness, and wasting. Statistical analysis. Initial sample size calculations determined the requirement for 12 clusters in each study arm, corresponding to 2,880 participants, assuming an intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.19, 28 120 participants per cluster, and a 10% loss to follow-up, to detect a 50% reduction in prevalence of each STH in the intervention arm compared with the control arm, with a power of 80% and α = 0.05. We chose 50% as the estimate of impact because we believed that WASH interventions would only be attractive as tools specifically for STH control if there is a sufficiently large benefit compared with deworming alone. Analysis of the baseline data indicated that our a priori sample size calculations overestimated the ICC for N. americanus but underestimated the ICC for Ascaris spp. (0.15 and 0.47, respectively). Power calculations described in the protocol paper confirmed that with a sample size of 18 communities (nine in each arm), for N. americanus, we still had the necessary power to detect a 50% reduction in the follow-up prevalence in the intervention arm compared with the control arm. 19 Data were entered in duplicate using a Microsoft Access database 29 and subsequently imported into Stata version 14.1 (College Station, TX) for data cleaning and analysis. All analyses were conducted using the 18 communities that were randomly allocated to study arms. Descriptive analyses were conducted at each of the five study time points to examine participation; demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical characteristics; WASH access and use; STH prevalence and infection intensity by qPCR; anthropometric indices; and anemia. Standard deviations and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were obtained for means and proportions in each study arm. When comparing proportions between the two arms at each time point, CI and P values were calculated using logistic regression models accounting for community-level clustering. The primary analysis was an available case analysis comparing the two study arms, and included all participants for whom outcome data (stool samples) were available at one or more follow-up time points. Generalized linear mixed models accounting for village-, household-, and individual-level clustering (i.e., to account for multiple measurements on the same individuals over time, with individuals nested within households and villages) were used to calculate relative risk (RR) for the primary and secondary outcomes in the intervention compared with the control arm, as a measure of the impact of the integrated intervention. We used Poisson regression to model RR for binary outcomes, ordinal logistic regression for categorical outcomes, and linear regression for continuous outcomes. Data from all follow-up time points were analyzed, with an interaction term between study arm and follow-up time point included in the fixed part of the model. To calculate a RR and CI for the study intervention (versus control) at each study time point, a post-estimation linear combination of coefficients and standard errors was calculated, using Waldtype methods. All models were adjusted for age and gender, entered as covariates in the models, and for village, household, and individual clustering, entered as random effects. For the infection-related outcomes (STH prevalence and intensity), models were only run for Ascaris spp. and N. americanus because baseline prevalence of the other species was very low. Additional models adjusting for baseline prevalence were also run; these models decreased the number of included observations relative to the original models because of missing data. A sensitivity analysis was performed by repeating the aforementioned generalized linear mixed models, with all 23 clusters that finished the trial, including the five clusters that were not randomly allocated, and observing whether this significantly impacted study results.RESULTS Figure 1 shows the trial profile. At baseline, between May 2012 and October 2013, in the 18 clusters that remained in the trial, we registered 2,306 residents in 493 households, of whom 2,100 were present at the time and 1947 participated in data collection (1,046 in the control arm and 901 in the intervention arm). Fieldwork was completed in April 2016. Baseline sociodemographic, clinical, and WASH characteristics as well as STH infections were mostly balanced across study arms and are shown in Table 1 . Approximately half of the participants were aged 18 years or older, with more than 40% of adults having never attended school. Detailed characterization of participants at baseline, including environmental and WASH risk factors for STH infection, and intensity of infection are described elsewhere. 20, [30] [31] [32] Participation rates at each study time point were similar in the intervention and control arms and are shown in Supplemental Table 1 . In total, 2,141 individuals (1,033 in the intervention arm and 1,108 in the control arm) participated in at least one follow-up time point, by completing a questionnaire and/or providing stool samples. Of these, 1,878 individuals (977 in the intervention arm and 901 in the control arm) provided stool samples at one or more follow-up time points and were included in the primary analysis. At baseline, the prevalence of Ascaris spp. was 14.0% (95% CI: 8.1-37.8) in the control arm versus 21.9% (7.6-36.6) in the intervention arm, whereas the prevalence of N. americanus was 59.8% (51.9-74.0) versus 60.5% (51.3-73.4). Ancylostoma spp., T. trichiura, and S. stercoralis were all much less prevalent. In terms of intensity of infection, 5.4% (1.9-14.6) of all samples were categorized as higher intensity Ascaris spp. infections in the control arm versus 11.1% (4.0-27.2) in the intervention arm, whereas 32.3% (24.1-38.2) versus 31.4% (26.6-36.6) were higher intensity N. americanus infections in control and intervention arms, respectively (Table 1 ). Aggregated WASH-related characteristics are shown in Table 1 , Figure 2 , and Supplemental Table 2 . At baseline, study arms were mostly balanced and characterized by low levels of sanitation and piped water access. Individual household toilet use was 20.3% (5.9-30.9) in the control arm versus 19.9% (6.3-31.3) in the intervention arm. Open defecation (defined as any nonuse of toilet, irrespective of toilet ownership) was practiced by 82.1% (72.8-95.6) of participants in the control arm versus 82.8% (70.9-94.7) in the intervention arm. The majority of the households used an unprotected water source: 86.1% (81.7-90.4) in the control arm versus 71.7% (65.8-77.7) in the intervention arm. No households in the control arm had access to piped water (tap stand in the community or their own plot), compared with 21.5% (16.0-26.9) in the intervention arm. In the intervention arm, household latrine use peaked at the first follow-up at 74.9% (62.4-89.9). Similarly, open defecation was lowest in the intervention arm at the first follow-up at 26.1% (12.0-39.1). Over the subsequent three follow-ups, latrine use in the intervention arm decreased and open defecation increased, whereas there were some improvements in sanitation in the control arm that were most evident at the last follow-up. Nevertheless, at the end of the trial, there remained During the final visit, we asked heads of households who had never built a latrine, or failed to rebuild a nonfunctional latrine, about their reasons for not building or failing to rebuild a latrine (Supplemental Table 3 ). The two most common reasons were lack of time, and lack of money or access to materials. Access to piped water increased over time in both arms. At the first follow-up, no households in the control arm had access to piped water, compared with 71.2% (65.0-77.3) in the intervention arm. At the end of the study, 61.8% (55.3-68.3) of participants in the control arm versus 81.6% (75.9-87.2) in the intervention arm (P < 0.001) had access to piped water (Figure 2 , Supplemental Table 2 ). With regard to handwashing behaviors, at baseline, 77.2% (63.5-91.6) of the respondents in the control arm reported using soap to wash hands versus 77.4% (56.5-87.7) in the intervention arm. Improvements in reported handwashing practices over time were modest, with no difference between study arms at any of the follow-up visits (Supplemental Table 2 ). Results of the generalized linear mixed models showed that the integrated WASH and deworming intervention had no effect on infection with Ascaris spp. (RR 2.87, 95% CI: 0.66-12.48, P = 0.159) or N. americanus (RR 0.99, 95% CI: 0.52-1.89, P = 0.987), relative to deworming alone (Table 2 , Supplemental Table 4 ). The intervention also had no detectable effect on the RR of higher intensity infection (Table 2 , Supplemental Table 4 ), or on infection intensity as a continuous measure (Supplemental Table 5 ), for either STH. Similar results were observed when running the models also adjusting for baseline infection status or intensity group (Supplemental Table 6 ). Infection-related outcomes over time are shown in Figure 3 and Supplemental Table 7 . At the end of the trial, prevalence of Ascaris spp. decreased to 4.5% (0.0-13.3) in the control arm and 14.3% (2.9-30.3) in the intervention arm. The prevalence of N. americanus decreased to 16.9% (11.6-28.2) in the control arm and 15.4% (9.6-24.6) in the intervention arm. Higher intensity Ascaris spp. infections decreased to 1.6% (0.2-11.1) in the control arm versus 5.6% (1.5-19.0) in the intervention arm, and higher intensity N. americanus infections to 6.3% (2.7-13.8) versus 4.0% (2.3-6.8). There were no significant differences at any time point in the prevalence, mean intensity of infection as determined by qPCR, or proportion of higher intensity infections between the control and intervention arms (Supplemental Table 7 ). Generalized linear mixed models for morbidity outcomes showed that by the end of the trial, the WASH and deworming intervention did not have any additional impact on anemia, stunting, thinness, wasting, or underweight, compared with deworming alone (Table 3 , Supplemental Table 8 ). A similar lack of effect of the intervention was observed when looking at each of these outcomes as continuous variables, except for height-for-age, where being in the intervention arm was associated with a lower Z-score (Supplemental Table 9 ). Morbidity indicators over time are shown in Supplemental Table 10 . At baseline, 15.4% (11.7-20.5) of participants who provided a finger-prick blood sample in the control arm were anemic versus 21.1% (15.3-25.4) in the intervention arm. There were no significant differences between study arms at most of the time points, except at baseline when participants in the intervention clusters had lower Hb, and at the last followup, when anemia was less prevalent in the intervention arm. In terms of proxy indicators for malnutrition, from the total number of eligible participants who provided height and weight measurements at baseline, 51.9% (41.4-60.4) were stunted in the control arm versus 64.7% (55. 3-72.7) in the intervention arm, 22.5% (16.1-29.5) versus 17.8% (11.9-23.3) were thin, 13.8% (5.6-24.3) versus 15.1% (5.2-22.5) were wasted, and 52.0% (42.3-61.2) versus 60.4% (48.3-66.7) were underweight (Table 3 , Supplemental Table 10 ). The only significant differences between study arms in nutrition-related morbidity indicators were on mean height-for-age Z-score that was lower in the intervention arm at baseline and the second follow-up and stunting that was higher at the same time points (Table 3 , Supplemental Table 10 ). The results of the generalized linear mixed models including participants in all 23 clusters who completed the study, including the five that were not randomly allocated, are shown in Supplemental Tables 11 and 12 , and show that study results remained similar. DISCUSSION This is the first cluster RCT investigating the additional benefit of a community WASH intervention on STH infections, relative to that achieved by community deworming alone. When looking at STH infection and intensity, for both Ascaris spp. and N. americanus, we found no effect of the integrated WASH and deworming intervention compared with deworming alone, after 2 years of follow-up. Over time, there was a substantial decrease in both study arms in prevalence and proportion of higher intensity infections of both STHs, which can be attributed to the regular biannual community deworming in all participating communities. Of note is that the impact of deworming was more pronounced for N. americanus than for Ascaris spp., despite albendazole being more efficacious against Ascaris spp. and the baseline prevalence of N. americanus being higher. This is likely due to greater environmental persistence of Ascaris spp. compared with that of N. americanus, resulting in more intense reinfection with the former. 33, 34 In terms of morbidity outcomes, we did not detect any impact of the WASH and deworming intervention relative to deworming alone, except on height-for-age Z-score, where the intervention arm was more likely to have a lower score; however, this may be explained by the fact that participants in the intervention arm had lower Z-scores at baseline. Furthermore, the trial was not powered to detect differences in these morbidity outcomes. Several factors, including study limitations, may explain the absence of an additional impact of the WASH program on infection outcomes beyond the benefit achieved by deworming. Importantly, although the WASH intervention considerably increased the number of participants who reported using a household latrine and households with access to piped water, it failed to achieve ""open defecation-free"" status, which is the ultimate goal of this type of intervention. At the end of the trial, more than a third of participants in the intervention arm were still practicing open defecation. Furthermore, the CLTS-inspired sanitation promotion was successful in motivating people to build latrines, with a peak at the first followup, but was unable to prevent slippage of latrine coverage. Therefore, it remains to be determined whether WASH would have a detectable impact if open defecation was eliminated. In addition, although the intervention arm was apparently superior to the control arm in terms of both sanitation and † Intensity group was run as an ordinal model, with the following categories: no infection, lower intensity infection, and higher intensity infection. Prevalence shown here is that of higher intensity infection. water access at all time points, there was an improvement in WASH conditions in the control arm that could have masked the impact of WASH intervention. Those improvements were either due to government initiatives, or because control clusters were aware that they would receive the WaterAid intervention at the end of the trial and that it required building latrines. We followed the participating communities for 2 years after the first round of deworming. It is known that Ascaris spp. eggs can survive for up to 5-10 years in the environment under favorable conditions. 34 Therefore, for Ascaris spp., a 2-year follow-up may not be sufficient for the impact of WASH to become apparent, given that the existing eggs contaminating the environment may be sufficient to continue reinfection. On the other hand, hookworm larvae only survive for a couple of months, 33 so one would expect to see reduced infections if the WASH intervention was successful at separating humans from their excreta. An additional limitation of this trial is the fact that we were only able to randomly allocate and follow 18 clusters, instead of the 24 initially recruited; however, sensitivity analysis indicated no differences in impact measures, and therefore it is unlikely that we would have found an effect with the larger sample. Also, of note is the fact that randomization achieved balance in the two arms for most variables analyzed at baseline, except for piped water access and deworming in the previous year; we believe the imbalance arose by chance. Finally, for Ascaris spp., given the underestimation of ICC, we were underpowered to detect a 50% reduction in infection in the intervention arm compared with the deworming alone clusters. Finally, although this would not have affected results of the primary analysis, an additional limitation of this trial was that WASH-related behaviors-particularly latrine use and handwashing practices-were self-reported. It was logistically not feasible to observe these behaviors because of the financial cost of doing so. This makes it difficult to appropriately monitor behavior change and uptake of the intervention, particularly in relation to handwashing behaviors, use of latrines, and persistence of open defecation. Self-reporting may result in overreporting of ""desirable"" behaviors (courtesy bias), 35 and structured observations can lead to a modification of the participants' behavior (""Hawthorne"" effect), 36 even in the case of rapidly collected spot check measurements. 37 Although techniques have been developed to assess latrine use and handwashing that do not rely on observation, including sensor systems 38 and testing for the presence of fecal bacteria in participants' hands, 17 additional research should prioritize examining soil contamination with STH infective forms that would quantify the extent to which WASH interventions, particularly the sanitation component, are effective. [39] [40] [41] So far, the only WASH intervention studies that reported an impact on STH infections are school-based interventions with a strong focus on promoting individual hygiene behavior. [13] [14] [15] [16] The two previous RCTs investigating the impact of community sanitation intervention, which were conducted in the context of the Indian Total Sanitation Campaign, failed to detect a reduction in STH infections as a result of the sanitation intervention. 17, 18 Short follow-up time, suboptimal coverage and use of latrines in the intervention arm, and contamination in the control arm have also been proposed to explain those results. This raises a question that must be addressed by the WASH sector and implementers of sanitation programs: What threshold of sanitation coverage is required for WASH interventions to effectively decrease STH reinfection and eventually interrupt transmission? Greater emphasis may need to be placed on achieving ""open defecation-free"" status. 42 Furthermore, given that most of the participants who reported practicing open defecation were children aged 5 years and younger, tailored approaches targeting this age group and their parents should be emphasized. Current debates about the best approach to achieve lasting behavior changes and sustainable latrine use have divided the field between proponents of CLTS-based approaches and † Anthropometric indices is defined as < -2 standard deviation below the mean of a standard population for the following indicators: stunting = weight-for-age; thinness = BMI-for-age, where BMI is calculated as weight (kg)/height 2 (cm); wasting = weight-for-height; and underweight = weight-for-age. proponents of subsidized approaches. A recent review and meta-analysis reported similar and modest (lower than 20%) increases in latrine coverage and use for both approaches. 43 Only one RCT has directly compared the uptake of different sanitation interventions. In this study, a community motivation approach did not increase latrine coverage, whereas subsidies increased coverage modestly. 44 A related issue is latrine sustainability. 45 Implementers of sanitation programs have reported that motivating people to build a latrine is less challenging than to sustain their use, especially if reconstruction is needed on latrine failure. 46 We found that in the intervention arm, a quarter of the residents did not build a latrine, and of those who did, around 10% failed to rebuild a latrine that became nonfunctional. Supporters of subsidized sanitation approaches argue that one of the advantages of subsidies is higher quality latrines, leading to greater durability and long-lasting changes in defecation practices. 47 In Timor-Leste, other innovative strategies for sustaining latrine coverage and use include marketing approaches introducing new affordable plastic products to upgrade latrines and vouchers for vulnerable households (A. Grumbley, personal communication). The present WHO guidelines recommend that deworming programs are stopped when the prevalence of high-intensity STH infections is less than one percent. 6 In this context, WASH may be able to prevent infection levels from returning to pre-deworming levels and contribute to sustainable STH control with eventual elimination. Future research is needed to test this hypothesis. The WASH Benefits RCT, comparing the effect of individual and combined WASH interventions on diarrhea, growth, and enteric infections including STH, in Kenya and Bangladesh, may be able to contribute evidence to fill this knowledge gap. 48 Whereas experimental studies may be necessary to generate evidence to inform guidelines and policies, mathematical modeling can also robustly test such hypotheses. Modeling can also shed light on the level of latrine uptake necessary to effectively reduce STH transmission. The recent fourth WHO report on neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) gives additional emphasis to WASH relative to its previous editions, following the release of the joint NTD-WASH strategy in 2015. 49, 50 The findings of our trial suggest that WASH interventions may not deliver immediate health benefits in terms of STH control and that deworming will decrease infections more rapidly. Program managers in both NTD control and WASH programs must be aware of the long-term investment that WASH interventions require before measurable indicators of health impact may be realized, and WASH interventions should focus on not only promoting initial latrine building but also achieving ""open defecation-free"" status and durable latrines able to sustain lasting change in behavior.CONCLUSION In the context of high endemicity and over a 2-year period, we found no evidence that an integrated community WASH intervention resulted in an additional reduction in STH infections beyond that achieved with deworming alone. Additional research is needed to determine the role of WASH on STH infections over a longer period of time and in the absence of deworming.FIGURE 1 . 1 FIGURE 1.

We measured geographically local spillovers in the Water Quality, Sanitation, and Handwashing (WASH) Benefits Study, a cluster-randomized trial in rural Bangladesh, by comparing outcomes among neighbors of intervention versus those of control participants. Geographically defined clusters were randomly allocated to a compound-level intervention (i.e., chlorinated drinking water, upgraded sanitation, and handwashing promotion) or control arm. From January 2015 to August 2015, in 180 clusters, we enrolled 1,799 neighboring children who were age matched to trial participants who would have been eligible for the study had they been conceived slightly earlier or later. After 28 months of intervention, we quantified fecal indicator bacteria in toy rinse and drinking water samples and measured soil-transmitted helminth infections and caregiver-reported diarrhea and respiratory illness. Neighbors' characteristics were balanced across arms. Detectable Escherichia coli prevalence in tubewell samples was lower for intervention participants' neighbors than control participants' (prevalence ratio = 0.83; 95% confidence interval: 0.73, 0.95). Fecal indicator bacteria prevalence did not differ between arms for other environmental samples. Prevalence was similar in neighbors of intervention participants versus those of control participants for soil-transmitted helminth infection, diarrhea, and respiratory illness. A compound-level water, sanitation, and handwashing intervention reduced neighbors' tubewell water contamination but did not affect neighboring children's health.","Improvements in household water quality, sanitation, and handwashing practices (WSH) may reduce the risk of diarrhea (1) , soiltransmitted helminth (STH) infection (2) , and respiratory illness (3, 4) . WSH interventions may also reduce illness among neighbors through ""spillover effects"" (5) (a.k.a., herd effects (6) (7) (8) or indirect effects (9) ) resulting from 1) reduced fecal contamination in the environment surrounding intervention recipients; 2) reduced pathogen transmission from intervention recipients to neighbors, resulting from recipients' lower disease burden due to intervention; or 3) adoption of promoted health behaviors by neighbors. If WSH interventions reduce illness among recipients and other individuals, estimates that ignore spillover effects would underestimate the full effect of WSH interventions. There is a rich literature on herd effects of vaccines (5, 7) . The literature on spillover effects for other infectious disease interventions, such as school-based deworming (10) and insecticide-treated nets (11) , is growing (5) . Whereas WSH interventions' direct effects on recipients have been measured in many empirical studies (1) (2) (3) , spillover effects of WSH have been measured in few studies (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) ; observational studies have been used to measure spillovers, so spillover estimates in the studies may have been susceptible to bias if there were systematic differences between individuals in close proximity to the intervention and individuals serving as controls. We measured spillover effects of a compound-level, combined WSH intervention in an existing, large, rigorously designed trial: the Water Quality, Sanitation, and Handwashing (WASH) Benefits Study in Bangladesh (20) . We measured whether compounds neighboring WASH Benefits intervention recipients had lower environmental contamination and whether the children in these compounds had a lower prevalence of STH, diarrhea, and respiratory illness compared with children of neighboring control participants.METHODSRandomization We performed a cluster-randomized trial that built on the WASH Benefits Study (20, 21) , which was conducted in the Gazipur, Mymensingh, Tangail, and Kishoreganj districts of central Bangladesh. These areas were selected because they had low groundwater levels of arsenic and iron (to avoid interference with chlorine water treatment) and no other WSH or nutrition programs. In the WASH Benefits Study, clusters were randomly assigned 1) drinking water treatment and safe storage, 2) sanitation, 3) handwashing, 4) combined WSH, 5) nutrition, 6) combined nutrition and WSH, and 7) no intervention (control) (21) . WASH Benefits Study investigators randomized treatment within geographic blocks containing adjacent clusters. A random-number generator was used to randomly assign participants to treatment or control arms of the study within groups of geographically contiguous clusters. Clusters were separated by at least 1 km to reduce the risk of betweencluster spillovers resulting from reductions in disease transmission or the adoption of interventions in the control group. No evidence of spillovers from the intervention group to the control group was found (20) . We measured geographically local spillovers among neighbors of trial participants in 90 control clusters and 90 combined WSH intervention clusters in the WASH Benefits Study from January 2015 to August 2015. To measure spillovers, we focused on the combined WSH intervention because we hypothesized that of all intervention packages in the trial, the combined WSH intervention was most likely to produce spillover effects (Figure 1 ). To coordinate data collection efforts and maximize comparability with the main trial, we selected control clusters where, in the main trial, researchers planned to collect environmental samples. Because interventions included visible hardware, neither the outcome measurement team nor study subjects were masked to intervention assignment.Participants In rural Bangladesh, families typically live in clusters of households with a common courtyard. Compounds were eligible for the WASH Benefits Study if a pregnant woman resided there at the time of study enrollment who intended to stay in her village during the follow-up period. A birth cohort of ""index"" children (in utero at enrollment) of enrolled mothers was followed during the trial. After 24 months of intervention, there were 6.4 study compounds per cluster, on average, and these compounds typically composed less than 10% of compounds located within the cluster boundaries. To measure spillovers, we enrolled compounds neighboring those in the WASH Benefits Study in intervention and control clusters concurrent with primary outcome measurement in the main trial. Neighbors were eligible if a child 0-59 months old at the time of spillover study enrollment (just younger or older than the index child cohort) resided there and if they were within 120 steps (2 minutes' walking time) of a WASH Benefits Study compound (Figure 2 ). We excluded children enrolled in the WASH Benefits Study and children in compounds that shared a courtyard, latrine, or handwashing station with a WASH Benefits Study compound. Within each cluster, there were typically 6-8 WASH Benefits Study compounds. For the spillover study, fieldworkers first enrolled the closest eligible neighboring compound adjacent to each WASH Benefits Study compound. Then they enrolled additional compounds, prioritizing those closest to WASH Benefits Study compounds, until 10 neighboring compounds were enrolled per cluster.Interventions Intervention recipients in the combined WSH arm received free chlorine tablets (Aquatabs (sodium dichloroisocyanurate); Medentech, Wexford, Ireland); a safe storage vessel in which to treat and store drinking water; child potties; sanitary scoop hoes (22) to remove feces from the household; latrine upgrades to a double-pit, pour-flush latrine for all households in the compound; and handwashing stations that included detergent soap and bottles of soapy water. Local promoters visited study compounds 6 times per month, on average, during the 2-year follow-up to encourage intervention uptake. The control arm and spillover study participants did not receive interventions or health promotion.Procedures Fieldworkers administered a survey to caregivers of enrolled children at the time of enrollment into the spillover study, concurrent with primary outcome measurements in the WASH Benefits Study (after 28 months of intervention). The survey was used to measure household characteristics, child illness, WSH indicators (e.g., water treatment), and neighbors' knowledge of the WASH Benefits Study and interactions with WASH Benefits Study participants and promoters. Due to political instability in Bangladesh, environmental and biological samples for the spillover study and the WASH Benefits Study were collected 4 months after the survey (i.e., after 32 months of intervention) to ensure safe transport and a cold chain. Fourteen children originally enrolled for the measurement of spillovers were not present to provide a stool sample; we enrolled another child in the compound aged 0-5 years to replace these children. All participants in the main trial and spillover study were offered a single dose of albendazole after stool collection regardless of infection status. Study children may have also received deworming through the national school-based deworming program. Two slides were prepared from each stool sample and analyzed using the Kato-Katz technique within 30 minutes of slide preparation (23) . Laboratory technicians quantified Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm, and Trichuris trichiura ova on each slide. Counts were double entered into a database by independent technicians. Two technicians counted 10% of the slides, and 5% were counted by a senior parasitologist for quality assurance. In a subset of 86 control and 80 intervention clusters, fieldworkers collected drinking water samples and recorded water source (i.e., tubewell, stored water container or filter, tap). They distributed a nonporous, sterilized toy ball to each enrolled child and collected it 24 hours later. Fieldworkers hung 1.4 m of sticky fly tape at least 1.2 m from the ground near the latrine and food preparation area in a location away from smoke or stoves and protected from rain; they counted and identified the species of flies on the tape 24 hours later. Laboratory technicians enumerated Escherichia coli and total coliform in water samples and E. coli and fecal coliform in toy rinses using membrane filtration. Additional details about field procedures are in Web Appendix 1 (available at https://academic.oup.com/aje).Outcomes We prespecified outcome measurement on ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier NCT02396407). We chose STH prevalence measured approximately 32 months after the intervention as the primary outcome of the spillover study because we believed spillovers were likely to affect STH transmission and because this objectively measured outcome is not subject to information bias. Stool samples with any ova were classified as positive. For each helminth, we quantified eggs per gram by multiplying the sum of egg counts from each of the duplicated slides by 12. We classified infection intensity into categories defined by the World Health Organization based on the number of eggs per gram of stool (moderate to high intensity was considered ≥5,000 eggs/g for A. lumbricoides, ≥1,000 eggs/g for hookworm, and ≥2,000 eggs/g for T. trichiura) (24) . Secondary outcomes included caregiver-reported 7-day diarrhea and respiratory illness prevalence measured approximately 28 months after the intervention. We defined diarrhea as caregiver's report in the prior 7 days of 3 or more loose or watery stools in 24 hours or 1 or more stools with blood in 24 hours. We defined respiratory illness as caregiver's report in the prior 7 days of persistent cough or difficulty breathing. Although health outcomes serve as distal spillover effects, we also measured proximal spillover effects on environmental contamination after 32 months of intervention and measured WSH indicators after 28 months of intervention. Environmental contamination measures included the prevalence of E. coli and total coliforms in drinking water, the prevalence of E. coli and fecal coliforms in sentinel toy rinses, and the presence and number of synanthropic flies near the latrine and food preparation areas. WSH indicators included self-reported water treatment the This figure depicts the study design in 2 clusters: 1 assigned to the combined WSH intervention and the other assigned to control. Each cluster was separated by a buffer zone of at least 1 km to minimize the chance of spillovers between clusters. The numbered circles denote the compounds enrolled in the WASH Benefits Study. The gray diamonds denote the neighboring compounds enrolled in the spillover study. The boundaries of each cluster were not formally defined in the WASH Benefits Study. In this figure, the darker-shaded center of each cluster is the polygon formed by linking the outermost compounds in each cluster, and the lighter-shaded section is the periphery around this polygon. We restricted enrollment to the compounds within this periphery to ensure that the 1 km buffer zone was maintained in this study. WSH, water, sanitation, handwashing. day before the interview, storage of drinking water, presence of a latrine with a functional water seal, no visible feces on the latrine slab or floor, presence of a dedicated handwashing location with soap, and no visible dirt on the index child's hands or fingernails.Sample size We expected spillover effects to be smaller than effects on intervention recipients, so we powered the study to detect a relative reduction of 2.5%-6.0% in primary outcomes, which was less than the 25% relative reduction expected in the WASH Benefits Study. We assumed prevalence differences for diarrhea (change from 14.2% to 8.2%), A. lumbricoides (from 4.2% to 1.7%), and T. trichiura (from 11.2% to 7.2%), and intracluster correlation coefficients ranging from 0.023 to 0.153 based on observational studies in rural Bangladesh and India (25) . Assuming 80% power and a type I error of 0.05, we calculated the required sample size for each outcome of interest, adjusting for the intracluster correlation coefficient. Given these assumptions, we planned to enroll 2,000 children in 180 clusters (90 per arm) in the spillover study.Statistical analyses Two investigators (J.B.C., A.E.) independently conducted an analysis of primary and secondary outcome datasets masked to treatment assignment following a prespecified analysis protocol, which describes our analysis in full (26) . Here, we provide an overview of our analysis. Analysis was intention to treat. Because WASH Benefits Study eligibility depended on pregnancy timing, we expected trial participants and adjacent neighbors to be equivalent, on average, except for their proximity to the WSH intervention, allowing us to make inferences about spillover effects by relying only on the cluster randomization. Our primary analysis estimated unadjusted prevalence ratios and differences for binary outcomes (21) and unadjusted fecal egg-count reduction ratios (1 minus the ratio of mean intensity in intervention vs. control Am J Epidemiol. 2018;187(8):1733-1744 arm neighbors) for fecal egg counts. Our secondary analysis adjusted for covariates with bivariate associations with each outcome (likelihood ratio test P value < 0.2) (27) . We excluded binary covariates with prevalence less than 5%. We estimated parameters using targeted maximum likelihood estimation with influence curve-based standard errors accounting for clustering (21) . Analysts were masked to intervention assignment until results were replicated. We assumed children were missing at random and conducted a complete-case analysis. For outcomes with loss to follow-up exceeding 20% of the planned sample, we used targeted maximum likelihood estimation to conduct an inverse probability of censoring-weighted analysis, which reweights measured outcomes to reconstruct the original study population as if no children had missing outcomes (28) . We assessed effect modification by the following prespecified covariates: Euclidian distance to the nearest WASH Benefits Study compound, number of steps to the nearest WASH Benefits Study compound, presence of natural physical boundaries (e.g., a pond) between spillover compounds and the nearest WASH Benefits Study compound, and the density of WASH Benefits Study compounds within a given radius of each spillover compound. All statistical analyses were completed using R, version 3.2.3 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).Human subjects protection We received approval from the institutional review boards at the University of California, Berkeley (no. 2011-09-3652), the International Centre for Diarrheal Disease Research, Bangladesh (no. PR-11063), and Stanford University (no. 25863). Participation of human subjects did not occur until after written informed consent was obtained.RESULTS A total of 6,329 compounds neighboring WASH Benefits Study compounds were screened for eligibility in the spillover study (Figure 3 ). Fieldworkers enrolled 900 children in 90 control clusters (control neighbors) and 899 children in 90 WSH clusters (intervention neighbors). Overall, 75% of enrollees (n = 634 control neighbors and n = 710 intervention neighbors) provided a stool specimen. Characteristics of intervention neighbors and control neighbors enrolled in the spillover study were balanced by randomization, and neighbors' characteristics were similar to those of WASH Benefits Study participants' (Table 1 ). Self-reported deworming was balanced across arms among WASH Benefits Study participants and children in the spillover study. A total of 815 (91%) intervention neighbors and 483 (54%) control neighbors knew of the WASH Benefits Study (Web Tables 1 and 2 ). Among intervention neighbors, 26% had spoken with WASH Benefits Study participants and 9% had spoken with WASH Benefits Study promoters about the study. Although intervention adherence was high among WASH Benefits Study participants at follow-up, there was no evidence of intervention use among intervention neighbors, control neighbors, and WASH Benefits Study control compounds at 2-year follow-up (Figure 4 ). Median fly counts and prevalence and mean log 10 concentrations of E. coli and fecal coliform in sentinel toy rinses were similar between intervention and control neighbors (Table 2 ). The prevalence of E. coli detected in drinking water was lower for intervention versus control neighbors (unadjusted prevalence ratio = 0.88; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.80, 0.96) (Table 3 ). This effect was stronger among water samples collected directly from the tubewell (prevalence ratio = 0.83; 95% CI: 0.73, 0.95), and there was no effect among samples from stored drinking water (prevalence ratio = 1.02; 95% CI: 0.95, 1.10). The prevalence of total coliforms was similar between arms in all drinking water samples regardless of water source. Among control neighbors, the prevalence of A. lumbricoides was 31.4%, of hookworm was 3.6%, and of T. trichiura was 3.9% (Table 4 ). There were no differences in STH prevalence comparing intervention and control neighbors: A. lumbricoides prevalence difference (PD) = 0.00 (95% CI: -0.07, 0.08); hookworm PD = 0.01 (95% CI: -0.01, 0.04); Trichuris PD = 0.02 (95% CI: -0.02, 0.05); and any STH infection PD = 0.02 (95% CI: -0.05, 0.09) (Table 4 , Figure 5 ). There were also no reductions in geometric fecal egg counts (Table 5 ). Prevalence of moderate or heavy infections was less than 5% for all helminths among intervention and control neighbors (Web Table 3 ). Four percent of control neighbors (n = 634) and 5% of intervention neighbors (n = 711) were infected with more than 1 helminth. The prevalence was also similar among intervention neighbors and control neighbors for diarrhea (8.0% vs. 7.6%) and respiratory illness (8.6% vs. 9.2%) (Table 4 ). Abbreviations: CFU, colony-forming unit; CI, confidence interval; SD, standard deviation. a For values below the detection limit (1 CFU/100 mL for water, 2.5 CFU/100 mL for toy rinses), we imputed 0.5 prior to taking the logarithm. b Standard errors account for clustering at the study cluster level. c Includes 55 compounds in which residents drew drinking water samples directly from a piped water source; these were not included in a separate stratification category, because of the low number of observations. A total of 903 drinking water samples (63%) provided by participants were collected from tubewells, 487 (33%) were from stored water, 55 (4%) were from piped water, and 3 (<1%) were from water filters. d Prevalence ratio could not be estimated because all samples contained total coliforms. Adjusted and inverse probability of censoring-weighted analyses produced similar results (Web Table 4 ). For all outcomes, prevalence ratios and differences comparing neighbors of intervention participants with neighbors of control participants were similar across levels of effect modifiers (Web Figures 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ).DISCUSSION We measured spillover effects of a combined WSH intervention on environmental contamination, hygienic behavior, and infectious disease outcomes in young children. By enrolling neighbors of randomly allocated trial participants, we were able to estimate geographically local spillover effects while relying on the original trial's randomization for inference. We hypothesized that spillovers would occur through 3 possible mechanisms: 1) reduced environmental fecal contamination; 2) reduced pathogen transmission from intervention recipients to neighbors, resulting from recipients' lower disease burden due to intervention; or 3) behavior change among neighbors. We found evidence of spillovers through the environmental mechanism: Neighbors of intervention recipients were less likely to have E. coli detected in their tubewell water. However, there was no evidence of reductions in other measures of environmental contamination or of STH infection, diarrhea, or respiratory illness among intervention neighbors compared with control neighbors. For our environmental assessment, we measured proximal spillover effects on environmental contamination. We found lower E. coli concentration in tubewells of intervention neighbors compared with those of control neighbors. Though we  did not find reductions in total coliforms in tubewell water, this indicator includes bacteria not of fecal origin (29) and is less sensitive to changes in fecal input into the environment than is E. coli. Improvements in latrine infrastructure may have reduced leakage into the groundwater (30); researchers have found fecal indicator bacteria in groundwater up to 2 m from pit latrines and up to 24.5 m in sandy soil (31) . We did not find reductions in environmental contamination as measured by fly density, sentinel toys, and stored water, which capture surface level contamination. Together, these findings suggest possible spillover effects through groundwater but not surface level environmental contamination. Secondary contamination through poor hand hygiene, for example, may have counteracted improvements to source water quality. Spillover effects may also have occurred if neighbors adopted interventions, but we found no evidence of intervention or behavior adoption. Limited hardware availability and lack of resources to purchase hardware likely inhibited diffusion of interventions to neighbors. Dual-pit latrines would have been costly for neighbors to construct themselves, and Aquatabs and the water storage container delivered as part of the WASH Benefits Study were not sold locally. Spillover effects may have been more likely if neighbors discussed interventions with WASH Benefits Study participants or saw them in use; however, only 26% of neighbors reported discussing the WASH Benefits Study with intervention recipients. Finally, the absence of behavior change among neighbors may reflect limited knowledge of or perceived harm of illness or low social desirability of the WASH Benefits Study interventions (32) . There are several features of this study that limit the generalizability of our findings. First, the intervention was only delivered to approximately 10% of each cluster on average. From the baseline survey of WASH Benefits Study households, which was fairly representative of study clusters as a whole, intervention coverage was approximately 30% for the water and handwashing components and 20% for the sanitation component, as measured by indicators shown in Figure 4 . Thus, by 2-year follow-up, when we measured spillover effects, overall intervention coverage in study clusters was likely to be less than 50%. WSH interventions delivered to entire populations (e.g., introduction of municipal piped water and sewerage) have been reported to be associated with reduced enteric infection (14) (15) (16) (17) . It is possible that a higher level of intervention coverage must be reached for WSH interventions to yield spillover effects. This is true for vaccines, many of which confer benefits to nonrecipients once immunization coverage reaches a herd immunity threshold (typically >75%) (7) . Some vaccines provide indirect protection to unvaccinated individuals at coverage levels below the herd immunity threshold. Second, in the original WASH Benefits Study, the combined WSH intervention led to small reductions in STH prevalence (PD = -3.5%; 95% CI: -7.5, 0.5) and diarrhea (PD = -1.7%; 95% CI: -2.9, -0.6) (20) . The size of spillover effects may be correlated with the size of effects on intervention recipients (33) ; for example, a large reduction in environmental contamination among intervention recipients would be more likely to translate into large spillover effects for neighbors than would a small reduction for intervention recipients. However, in this study, impacts on intervention recipients' health and environmental contamination may have been too modest to reduce transmission to neighbors. Our study is subject to several limitations. First, we measured diarrhea and respiratory illness through caregiver report. Poor recall may have led to misclassification; however, because neighbors did not receive interventions, any misclassification was likely to be nondifferential by study arm, which would have biased results toward the null. Second, the double-slide Kato-Katz technique has low sensitivity in low-infection intensity settings such as Bangladesh, where large-scale, school-based deworming programs have been offered since 2008 (34) . This may have limited our statistical power to detect spillover effects, which we would expect to be smaller than effects on intervention recipients. Finally, we did not define social networks. There is some evidence that enteric and respiratory pathogens can spread through social networks (35) ; although this has been examined for WSH interventions in few studies, spillovers through social networks are theoretically plausible (18) .Conclusion A compound-level, combined WSH intervention reduced contamination of neighbors' tubewell water but did not lead to spillovers for other proximal measures of contamination in the domestic environment or for child health outcomes. For proximal spillover effects to translate to distal spillover effects, improvements in neighbors' health behaviors may have been necessary. Alternatively, spillover effects may be more pronounced in populations with higher disease transmission or higher levels of WSH intervention coverage in the community.Figure 1 . 1 Figure 1.

Each cluster was separated by a buffer zone of at least 1 km to minimize the chance of spillovers between clusters. The numbered circles denote the compounds enrolled in the WASH Benefits Study. The gray diamonds denote the neighboring compounds enrolled in the spillover study. The boundaries of each cluster were not formally defined in the WASH Benefits Study. In this figure, the darker-shaded center of each cluster is the polygon formed by linking the outermost compounds in each cluster, and the lighter-shaded section is the periphery around this polygon. We restricted enrollment to the compounds within this periphery to ensure that the 1 km buffer zone was maintained in this study. WSH, water, sanitation, handwashing.Figure 3 . 3 Figure 3.

It is an entertainment-based intervention study to promote health by reducing the impact of parasitic diseases such as soil-transmitted helminths (STH). The study uses traditional Javanese shadow puppetry (wayang kulit) as a vehicle in village communities to disseminate health messages and promote behaviour change to prevent diseases caused, primarily, by inadequate sanitation and poor hygiene. The health education messages contained in the play, although using traditional characters and themes, required the creation of a completely new narrative script, using characters and plot lines familiar to the wayang kulit repertoire, but placing them in new situations that relate specifically to health promotion objectives. The intervention was piloted in a village in Central Java, Indonesia using a pre/post design with both qualitative and quantitative analysis. A total of 96 male and female villagers, aged between 7 and 87 years, provided both baseline and follow up data. Participant knowledge and behaviours related to gastrointestinal and helminth-related disease were assessed before and after the intervention through a questionnaire administered by interview. Results revealed statistically significant improvements in both knowledge (48.6% pre-intervention score vs. 62.8% post-intervention score, p < 0.001) and behaviour (77.4% vs. 80.6%, p = 0.004) related to gastrointestinal and helminth disease. Findings of the study indicate the wayang kulit performance is an effective health education tool. The results provide proof of concept with scaling up the next step forward. The wayang kulit production provides a significant additional component for an integrated, comprehensive approach to reduction and elimination of STH infection.","Introduction Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) affect more than one billion of the world's population and cause significant impacts on the economies of the developing and under-developed countries due to loss of productivity in the workforce and high health costs. The most common of the NTDs are a group of intestinal parasitic nematodes, collectively known as soil-transmitted helminths (STH), generally referring to roundworms (Ascaris lumbricoides), whipworms (Trichuris trichiura) and hookworms (Necator americanus and Ancyclostoma duodenale). It is estimated that nearly 1 in 5 people are infected with STH globally [1] with the highest concentration in Asia, where approximately one quarter of the population is believed to host at least one species [2] . STH are typically found in tropical and sub-tropical regions, particularly where poverty is rife such as rural communities with limited access to clean water, inadequate sanitation and poor hygiene behaviour [3] . Infection occurs primarily through ingestion of parasite eggs or skin contact with motile larvae in contaminated soil [4] . Contaminated vegetables or water can also act as media for parasite transfer [5] . While mortality is rare, chronic or high intensity infections can result in decreased stamina and work output and complications during pregnancy [6, 7] . In children, who are highly vulnerable to infection clinical manifestations such as malnutrition, wasting, stunting and poor cognitive function can be particularly detrimental [8] [9] [10] . Soil-transmitted helminths have been reported across the Indonesian archipelago with an average prevalence of 31.8% during the period 2002 to 2009 [11] . A recent systematic review of STH in South Asia and South East Asia reported a countrywide prevalence for Indonesia of 22% for Ascaris, 20% for hookworm and 12% for Trichuris [3] . Poverty permeates many Indonesian rural communities where education levels are generally low, access to clean water and adequate sanitation is limited, most households lack latrines and open defecation is common [12, 13] . Characteristics such as these in combination with ideal climatic conditions, facilitate the ongoing transmission of STH. Currently, the global STH control strategy is through periodic mass drug administration (MDA) of anthelminthic drugs (albendazole or mebendazole) to high risk groups, especially school-aged children. Whilst chemotherapy is effective at reducing worm burden and treating symptoms, efficacy varies across STH species and most importantly, it does not prevent reinfection which can occur almost immediately post-treatment [4, 14, 15] . Transmission interruption requires changes to hygiene behaviour, access to safe water and improvements to sanitation. In low resource settings, improving basic sanitation and access to clean water is challenging and therefore improving knowledge and awareness of STH and changing hygiene behaviour is a critical and generally low-cost option to support MDA programmes. Hence, the importance of incorporating health education into control and prevention programmes cannot be understated. 'Entertainment-education' (E-E) or 'edutainment' is the process of delivering an educational media message that is designed to be entertaining and engaging, without invoking resistance, with the purpose of increasing audiences' knowledge, creating favourable attitudes and changing undesirable behaviours related to a particular issue [16, 17] . Ensuring that the message is communicated and delivered in a culturally appropriate and acceptable manner is equally as important to maximise the effectiveness of the health educational tool. Edutainment style interventions have been shown to be highly effective in educating the public about significant health issues [18] . A recent and highly successful example is the 'Magic Glasses' hygiene education intervention. Targeting Chinese primary school children in Hunan Province, the short animated narrative cartoon, designed to educate viewers on STH infection and prevention, was shown to reduce the incidence of STH infection by 50% (OR = 0.5, 95% CI 0.35-0.7, p < 0.0001) in intervention schools compared with control schools [19] . The Magic Glasses example has provided proof of principle that edutainment style interventions can improve knowledge and influence behaviour related to STH infection, thus opening up the opportunity for new creative interventions to be developed. In the current study, we aimed to develop a culturally appropriate intervention designed to engage with a mixed age Javanese audience based on the 'wayang kulit', a traditional shadow puppetry production. The objective of this study was to pilot a wayang kulit based intervention as a vehicle to disseminate health education and promote behaviour change to prevent diseases caused, primarily, by inadequate sanitation and poor hygiene.MethodsStudy Design A pre-post design (Figure 1 ) was used to pilot an entertainment-based health education intervention as a tool to increase awareness and improve knowledge and behaviour related to STH. In addition, this pilot study also aimed to examine the acceptability and cultural appropriateness of the intervention and to provide proof of concept. This study is part of larger study investigating the effectiveness of a squat latrine and health education package. For the current study, a traditional Javanese shadow puppetry production was developed with health education messages written into the script using characters and plot lines familiar to the wayang kulit repertoire. The musical accompaniment is a musical-cultural fusion involving both the traditional musical accompaniment of Javanese gamelan and Western instruments, especially rock band instrumentation. The production was filmed and presented to the participants in Bahasa Indonesia in video format. Further information on the development of the shadow puppetry, titled 'Rama and the Worm' (RATW) can be found in [20] . Figure 2 shows a still shot taken from RATW.

Wonosobo is largely rural. It is estimated that more than half of households do not have adequate latrines and open defecation is commonly practiced [21] . The research was facilitated through the NGO Yayasan Wahana Bakti Sejatera (YWBS) Foundation. Discussions took place with local leaders and education specialists prior to the study. Their support was gained, as critical decision-makers, for the project. Initially the village leaders were approached, the study was explained and their support was canvassed. Following initial meetings, a comprehensive information sheet was provided to all households explaining the study and requirements for inclusion, such as agreeing to view the RATW production and being available for data collection. Interviewers then went to a random selection of 100 households, identified eligible residents (detailed below) and obtained their informed consent to participate. Only those who agreed to participate in the project in a household were interviewed using the 'Rama HELP (Helminth Education and Latrine Project)' questionnaire at baseline (see Supplementary Files A and B). Sample size was calculated using Medcalc [22] and using differences in proportion at 95% confidence interval and power of 80%. From prior experience in Wonosobo (8 dusuns currently involved in a larger STH prevention study) it was anticipated that about 10% of the residents interviewed would have reasonable knowledge and practices of STH at pre-intervention and that this was expected to increase to 30% post-intervention. The sample size was 62 with a ratio of 1 between the two groups. However, it was decided to select a sample size of 100 people from the village in order to cater for loss of subjects through absence, ill health or lack of availability for follow-up, in order to maximise the number of people that complete both pre-and post-interviews. After the baseline data collection, the 'Rama and the Worm' video was shown to the village. Two weeks after the video was screened the follow-up took place. Inclusion criteria were (1) the respondent is aged 5 years of over; (2) the respondent agrees to watch the screening of 'Rama and the Worm'; (3) the respondent is capable of understanding and responding to the questions asked by interviewers; (4) the respondent (or his/her parent) agrees to, and signs, the Informed Consent form.Data Collection Structured and semi-structured questionnaires were developed. The structured questionnaire comprised six sections eliciting details on demographic background, household characteristics, latrine use, knowledge and practices related to STH, and the presence of symptoms. The questionnaire was administered by interview in 2016 to the same cohort before and two weeks after viewing the video.Study Location and Participants The study was conducted in the village of Candi Mulyo in the district of Wonosobo, Central Java, Indonesia.

The structured questionnaire comprised six sections eliciting details on demographic background, household characteristics, latrine use, knowledge and practices related to STH, and the presence of symptoms. The questionnaire was administered by interview in 2016 to the same cohort before and two weeks after viewing the video.Data Management and Analysis Knowledge and behaviour were assessed using a scoring system based on the number of correct responses. Knowledge scores were based on 14 questions (Supplementary Table S1 ) points) relating to gastrointestinal and helminth-related disease transmission, symptoms and prevention with a maximum score of 27 points. Behaviour scores were based on 17 questions (Supplementary Table S2 ) relating to handwashing and other hygiene practices with a maximum score of 60 points. All questions with yes or no responses were allocated a maximum of 1 point for a correct answer. Knowledge questions with scale-like responses were graded with optimal answers allocated the highest score of 2 (e.g., strongly agree) and least desirable answers (e.g., strongly disagree) with zero points. Likert type behaviour questions were similarly graded, except the most ideal responses were allocated 4 points, reducing down to zero for least ideal responses. For example, if a respondent said they ""always"" wash their hands before eating they would be allocated the maximum number of points (i.e., 4), ""often"" would receive 3 points, ""sometimes"" with 2 points, occasionally with 1 point and ""never"" with 0 points. For all questions, zero points were allocated for ""don't know"" or where no response was provided. Henceforward, the term 'score' refers to scores as a percentage of the maximum number of points possible (87 points). Score differences were calculated by subtracting the pre-intervention score from the post-intervention score and thus reflect the percentage point difference between the two. Statistical analyses were conducted in R version 1.1.442 (R Core Team, Vienna, Austria, 2018) and Microsoft Excel. Categorical data were analysed using Pearson's chi-squared (χ 2 ) test, respectively. Comparisons of two-level categorical and interval continuous data were analysed using the Welch Two Sample t-test and where categorical data consisted of more than two levels, ANOVA was used. Post-hoc analysis of ANOVA results were assessed using the Tukey HSD test. Univariate logistic regression was used to determine if demographic background could predict a positive effect from viewing the intervention, thereby allowing us to determine to whom the intervention was most effective. Univariate logistic regression analysis and odds ratios calculations using a 95% confidence interval were performed using R version 3.4.0 (R Core Team, Vienna, Austria, 2018).ResultsRespondent Demographics A total of 129 people were recruited, of which 109 completed the survey at baseline. At follow up, a loss of 13.8% of respondents was reported due to not being available, leaving a total of n = 96 participants who completed the survey. The data presented here refer to the n = 96 individuals from which both baseline and follow up data were collected. The cohort consisted of roughly equal numbers of males (n = 47) and females (n = 49). Age of participants ranged between 7 and 87 (mean = 34.8 years, SD = 16.5). The majority of participants (67.7%) had an elementary level of education and more than a third (n = 25) worked in agriculture (farmer/plantation worker). Mean monthly household income was 1,615,441 IDR (SD = 2,149,406), equivalent to approximately 120 USD. Further demographic details are provided in Supplementary Table S1 .Participant History of Gastrointestinal Disease and Presence of Symptoms In the three months prior to the baseline survey, 12.5% (n = 12) of participants had been diagnosed with worms in their stool on an average of 2.7 (range: 1-20) occasions. Treatment was sought by 10 of those diagnosed, mostly (70%) with a health professional (e.g., physician, public health centre staff or midwife). The remaining three individuals used medication (n = 1 with traditional medicine).Latrine Habits More than half (n = 50) of our study participants lived in a house without a latrine, with inadequate finances (64.0%) reported as the main limiting factor. The vast majority (72.0%) of these participants relied on public latrines whilst 10% used a neighbour or relative's latrine and 18% openly defecated into nearby rivers or bushes. Of the (n = 46) participants who lived in a dwelling with a latrine, two did not utilise it and visited a public latrine instead. The latrines were not reported to be broken and no further explanation was provided. Less than 40% (n = 18) of the latrines located in participant's homes were classified as improved by WHO standards (i.e., connected to a septic tank (i.e., improved) and among the unimproved latrines (n = 28), more than two thirds (n = 19) flowed into a river or fish pond and the remaining one third were pit type latrines. Most (93.5%) latrines were located indoors with floor spaces that were at least quarter to fully tiled or cemented (78.3%). With regard to cleaning practices after defecation, the preferred method was to use water in the bathroom (96.9%). Cleaning oneself in the river (2.1%) or with paper in the bathroom (1.0%) were also mentioned.Knowledge of Gastrointestinal and Helminth-Related Disease Transmission, Symptoms and Prevention Baseline level of knowledge of gastrointestinal and helminth-related disease was limited, although there was considerable variation (Figure 3 ). Mean score at baseline was 48.6% (SD = 16.0). Knowledge of bowel infection causes and symptoms of round worm (A. lumbricoides) infection were especially poor (Table 1 ). Participants were also largely unaware that human faeces can contain infectious agents that can make people ill and that faeces of seemingly healthy individuals can also contain disease causing agents such as parasitic worm eggs. Knowledge of positive sanitation practices was also limited, given that less than half of the cohort was aware that defecating in the river or bush can spread diseases and is not considered good health behaviour. In contrast, nearly all (91.7%) participants knew that worms can cause illness. defecated into nearby rivers or bushes. Of the (n = 46) participants who lived in a dwelling with a latrine, two did not utilise it and visited a public latrine instead. The latrines were not reported to be broken and no further explanation was provided. Less than 40% (n = 18) of the latrines located in participant's homes were classified as improved by WHO standards (i.e., connected to a septic tank (i.e., improved) and among the unimproved latrines (n = 28), more than two thirds (n = 19) flowed into a river or fish pond and the remaining one third were pit type latrines. Most (93.5%) latrines were located indoors with floor spaces that were at least quarter to fully tiled or cemented (78.3%). With regard to cleaning practices after defecation, the preferred method was to use water in the bathroom (96.9%). Cleaning oneself in the river (2.1%) or with paper in the bathroom (1.0%) were also mentioned.Knowledge of Gastrointestinal and Helminth-Related Disease Transmission, Symptoms and Prevention Baseline level of knowledge of gastrointestinal and helminth-related disease was limited, although there was considerable variation (Figure 3 ). Mean score at baseline was 48.6% (SD = 16.0). Knowledge of bowel infection causes and symptoms of round worm (A. lumbricoides) infection were especially poor (Table 1 ). Participants were also largely unaware that human faeces can contain infectious agents that can make people ill and that faeces of seemingly healthy individuals can also contain disease causing agents such as parasitic worm eggs. Knowledge of positive sanitation practices was also limited, given that less than half of the cohort was aware that defecating in the river or bush can spread diseases and is not considered good health behaviour. In contrast, nearly all (91.7%) participants knew that worms can cause illness.  After the intervention, knowledge scores improved on average by 14.3 (SD = 17.2) percentage points, although 26.0% (n = 25) of participants showed no improvement. Nonetheless, Figure 4 reveals that overall, participant knowledge improved after the intervention. Improvements were seen across all knowledge questions assessed (Table 1 ) and demographic groups (Supplementary Table S3 ), except among unemployed participants. Relatively small gains in improvement were also observed among 7 to 12 year olds (mean increase = 5.8, SD = 11.1), 40 to 49 years (5.3, SD = 14.5), 60 years and over (7.4, SD = 9.9), students (8.6, SD = 13.3), and those in the other employment category (6.8, SD = 18.3). Despite no statistically significant differences in knowledge score changes between genders, more than one third (n = 17) of females failed to improve upon their score after the intervention, which is double the proportion of males with no improvement (17.0%). A high level of education was associated with a significant increase in knowledge as seen by the 37 percentage point (F [3,92] = 4.55, p = 0.005) increase for senior or higher educated participants compared to 11.6 (SD = 16.1), 14.6 (SD = 15.9) and 16.6 (SD = 10.9) percentage points for elementary, junior educated and uneducated participants, respectively. Post-hoc analysis revealed score differences between the senior or higher educated group and the elementary and junior educated groups were statistically significant (p = 0.002 and p = 0.027, respectively). Participants who were employed (e.g., company employee, self-employed or farm/plantation workers) also improved in their scores more so than their non-employed counterparts (Supplementary Table S3 ). Knowledge scores of participants living in a house with a latrine improved on average by 16.5% compared to 12.1% for those without a latrine, although the differences were not within significant levels (p = 0.08). Univariate logistic regression analyses were performed but revealed no meaningful associations between demographic variables and knowledge scores (data not shown).Behaviours Related to Gastrointestinal and Helminth Disease Despite the limited knowledge described above, mean behaviour scores at baseline (Table 2 ) indicate that study participants generally engage in preventative behaviour related to gastrointestinal and helminth disease. Consumption of raw or uncooked vegetables and buying uncovered food from street traders were however commonly practiced. Nearly two thirds (n = 61) either regularly or occasionally consume uncooked vegetables and 79.2% (n = 76) purchase uncovered food from street traders. Using utensils for eating was also not common among participants with only 40.6% (n = 39) reportedly engaging in this practice on a regular basis.Behaviours Related to Gastrointestinal and Helminth Disease Despite the limited knowledge described above, mean behaviour scores at baseline (Table 2 ) indicate that study participants generally engage in preventative behaviour related to gastrointestinal and helminth disease.

Behaviour scores at follow up indicate little change occurred in participant behaviour after viewing Rama and the Worm. Statistically significant improvements in score were identified for two variables: the use of utensils for eating (difference of 9.8% between pre-and post-intervention scores, p = 0.010) and keeping flies or other insects away from food (a difference of 7.3%, p = 0.048). Overall, the intervention resulted in a small yet statistically significant improvement (2.3%, p = 0.004), as shown in Figure 5 , with a positive change in behaviour score identified in three of five participants.Discussion With more than 1.5 billion people estimated to be infected [1] , a disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of 3.4 million [23] , and a treatment that does not prevent reinfection, STH is of major global significance.

For health information to be received positively and to be effective at reinforcing educational messages and promoting positive behaviour change among a target audience, it should be delivered in an attractive and relatable manner [16] . Furthermore, in a recent set of behaviour change communication guidelines from the Smart Development Works Organisation [25] , the comment: ""Within the WASH sector there is an increasing understanding that hygiene promotion requires more than business-as-usual approaches"", emphasises the need for novel and innovative programs to be created and implemented. The Magic Glasses program, trialled in China, is a prime example of the positive effect that a well-designed and executed edutainment-style health promotion initiative can have on preventing parasitic diseases [19] . Another recent example of the use of an animated film to promote health messages was a study undertaken in northern Thailand in an area where only half of the children are vaccinated against vaccine-preventable diseases, despite the government offering this service for free [26] . The edutainment intervention targeted a minority ethnic group of mothers to promote childhood vaccination. The intervention resulted in a three-fold improvement in knowledge (proportion of participants with a good knowledge at baseline = 24.6% vs. 75.4 at follow up, p < 0.010) and a 20% improvement in both perceptions towards childhood immunisation programmes (82.6% vs. 63.8%, p = 0.012) and perceived correct practices (84.1% vs. 66.7%, p = 0.010). The edutainment module was also positively received by both health-care providers and villagers, which is crucial for the success of any intervention. In the current study, we describe the findings of a pilot study testing the effectiveness of a traditional Javanese shadow puppetry production (wayang kulit) as a vehicle to educate and promote behavioural change related to STH disease prevention in village communities in Central Java. Our findings indicate that RATW is an effective health and hygiene education tool, particularly in terms of improving knowledge of gastrointestinal and helminth-related disease. Prior to the intervention, participants knew little of what can cause bowel infections and were unfamiliar with symptoms of STH infection. Similarly, many were unaware that human faeces can contain bacteria and worm eggs, including that of visibly healthy individuals, despite the fact that nearly all participants knew that worms can cause illness. The overall low level of knowledge of gastrointestinal and helminth-related disease at baseline suggests that people living in the study area have either had limited exposure to STH-related health information or that too much time has passed since the information was received. We found that viewing RATW improved STH knowledge and awareness of approximately three quarters of our study participants, with an overall significant improvement in knowledge across all but one variable (which was already very high at baseline, i.e., 91.7%). Despite this, our findings also indicate that the intervention was more effective among some groups compared to others. This was particularly evident among higher educated participants and those who were in paid employment and although we may be inclined to assume one is associated with the other, this was not the case in our study. A 2013 study in Pahang state, Malaysia also reported better knowledge of STH and gastrointestinal-related disease among educated and employed participants compared to those who had lower education levels or were not employed [27] . The intervention also appeared to be more effective for males, given that one-third of females failed to improve their knowledge after viewing RATW, despite there being no difference in education levels. Interestingly, we also found that the intervention was less effective at improving knowledge among the very young and very old. Whether this is due to a reduced ability to interpret the messages, or a lack of interest is uncertain, as the questionnaire did not elicit information in this regard. Although less effective at modifying behaviour than improving knowledge, the intervention succeeded in changing sanitation and hygiene related behaviour in 60% of participants. There appear to be a few behaviours that people are either reluctant or find more challenging to change, which could also signal practices common in the area that put people at greater risk of infection. Using utensils for eating and protecting food from flies or insects were the only practices that improved significantly between baseline and follow up. However, there was a small and significant improvement in overall behaviour. The generally positive heath behaviours practiced prior to the intervention may explain the relatively small change observed. It also possible that the short interval between baseline and follow up (1 month) was not long enough to induce positive modifications as behaviour change is generally a long term outcome measure [25] . Continued exposure to educational messages over a longer period of time would also likely result in a more marked improvement [28] . It is also important to highlight that due to time and financial constraints our study measured self-reported behaviour, which is known to be inherently problematic [29] given that this approach relies on participant honesty, memory and level of understanding. Therefore, hygiene practices reported here may be an over representation of true behaviour among the study population and our findings should be interpreted accordingly. Sociodemographic background played no role in whether an individual modified their behaviour after viewing RATW, with the exception of the presence or absence of latrines in the home. Although the higher mean score difference for participants living in a home with a latrine was not found to be significantly different to that of participants without a latrine, the p-value was very close to 0.05 suggesting there may be an association that our study missed due to the small sample size. This was also the case for knowledge and latrines. Testing the intervention on a larger sample size would likely bring greater clarity as to whether a link exists between the presence of latrines in the home and knowledge improvement or behaviour change. The high level of within group variation made it difficult to determine the role of sociodemographic factors in knowledge and behaviour change in such a small sample size. A limitation of our study was the small sample size, which made it difficult to accurately measure the variability within the study population. In addition, we did not have a control group, which would have enabled us to better assess the effectiveness. We also did not assess the effectiveness of the intervention on STH infection or compare different health educational tools. However, the main objectives of the study were to determine the cultural appropriateness and acceptability of a traditional Javanese shadow puppetry style performance and its effectiveness to disseminate health education and promote behaviour change. Given that some knowledge variables improved more than others and only a small change in behaviour was observed suggests there is room for improvement. One such example would be to test the intervention using the local Javanese dialect rather than in Bahasa Indonesia. The local dialect may have improved understanding among the audience, particularly in a rural setting such as used in this study where many of the participants had limited formal education. The findings of this study provide proof of concept enabling us to move forward and upscale into a community-based cluster-randomised intervention trial testing RATW in combination with a latrine intervention in East and West Java.Conclusions Whilst we acknowledge that the RATW intervention has limitations, our pilot study does indicate that with some modifications, wayang kulit could be an effective tool either on its own or as an addition to other more traditional approaches for improving gastrointestinal and helminth related knowledge and promoting good health behaviour. The results provide proof of concept with scaling up the next step forward. The wayang kulit production provides a significant additional component for an integrated, comprehensive approach to reduction and elimination of STH infection.Supplementary Materials: The following are available online at http://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/15/9/2050/ s1, Table S1 : Knowledge questions assessed to calculate scores, Table S2 : Behaviour questions assessed to calculate scores, Table S3 : Association between demographic variables and knowledge and behaviour (scores presented as a percentage of maximum score).

Acupuncture may be a potential treatment option for VM prophylaxis, but the currently available evidence is still uncertain. Therefore, this trial aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for VM prophylaxis. Methods: This is a 28-week parallel, randomized, controlled clinical trial including 4 weeks of baseline, 8 weeks of treatment, and 16 weeks of follow-up. A total of 72 participants will be randomly assigned to two groups. The participants will receive acupuncture in the experimental group, while the participants in the control group will be treated with venlafaxine. The primary outcome measures are change in vertigo/migraine days and vertigo/migraine attacks, vertigo severity, and migraine intensity per 4 weeks from baseline. The secondary outcome measures are change in doses of rescue medication, anxiety level, depression level, and quality of life per 4 weeks from baseline. Adverse events will be recorded for safety evaluation. Discussion: This study will investigate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for VM prophylaxis. The results will contribute to determining whether acupuncture can serve as an optional treatment strategy for treating VM.","INTRODUCTION Vestibular migraine (VM) is the most common cause of recurrent spontaneous attacks of vertigo, except for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, which is causally related to migraine (1) . Its typical clinical features consist of recurrent episodic vestibular symptoms and migrainous symptoms. Vestibular symptoms can present as vertigo/dizziness, unsteadiness, oscillopsia, and intolerance of head movement, while migrainous symptoms can be characterized by migrainous headache, photophobia, phonophobia, and visual or other neurologic auras (1) . VM can occur at any age, but it is more prevalent in women and in the age group of 30-40 years (2, 3) . Epidemiological data of outpatient service show that VM accounts for about 9% of patients in migraine clinics (1) , 11% of patients in dizziness clinics (4), and 4.2-29.3% of patients in otolaryngology clinics (5, 6) . Despite its high incidence rate, the diagnosed rate of VM is low. As shown in a previous study, referring doctors had suspected only 1.8% of patients to have VM in a tertiary vertigo center, but a diagnosis was finally reached in 20.2% (7) . Moreover, VM often leads to some common comorbidities, such as Meniere's disease and psychological disorders (especially anxiety and depression), which contribute to an increasing global burden (8) (9) (10) . Nevertheless, till now, the pathogenesis of VM has been inconclusive, and further research are urgently warranted. Consequently, there is not any widely acknowledged therapy for treating VM. At present, the treatment of VM mainly includes rescue treatment and prophylaxis, both of which are mainly pharmacological-based therapies and often lead to a series of unavoidable side effects, such as dizziness, paresthesia, dyspepsia, dry mouth, nausea, somnolence, and chest discomfort (11) . Moreover, frequent VM attacks can seriously affect the daily life of patients. Therefore, prophylaxis treatment is very important for VM patients. As a consensus among expert proponents in China, it is vital for VM patients to receive prophylaxis treatment assuming that the frequency of vertigo/migraine episodes is at least three times per month in the past 3 months or the response to rescue therapies is poor in the acute phase of VM (12) . Thus, there is a great need to identify alternative preventive treatments for VM. As one of the major treatment modalities of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), acupuncture has gained an important role as a non-pharmaceutical therapy for treating a variety of diseases or conditions, thereby receiving increasing worldwide acceptance. Acupuncture may be a potential treatment option for VM prophylaxis, the rationales of which include two major considerations. First, previous studies have reported encouraging results favoring acupuncture for treating vertigo/dizziness (13) and migraine (14, 15) , which are major clinical symptoms of VM. Meanwhile, there are several reports indicating that acupuncture is beneficial to psychological disorders such as anxiety and depression (16, 17) , which are common comorbidities of VM. Second, emerging studies have revealed that the pathogenesis of VM is related to the dysfunction of the connection between the trigeminal-vestibular-vagus nerves (18, 19) . As a form of stimulation, cumulative evidence demonstrates that acupuncture can relieve the symptoms of patients via mediating neural plasticity (20) . In this scenario, acupuncture can be considered as a potential treatment option for patients with VM, but the current evidence remains inconclusive (21) . In recent years, VM has increasingly attracted the attention of clinicians and researchers; however, there is yet a great lack of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating acupuncture for VM prophylaxis. Therefore, the present study protocol of a RCT aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for VM prophylaxis, which will provide evidence and guide clinicians in this field.METHOD AND ANALYSISStudy Design The design of this trial is based on the Standards for Reporting Interventions in Clinical Trials of Acupuncture (22) and the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (23) reporting guidelines. This randomized, controlled, single-center clinical trial will comprise two parallel groups. The participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either the acupuncture group or the control group. The flowchart of the trial is presented in Figure 1 , and the schedule of enrolment, interventions, and outcome assessments are presented in Table 1 .Ethical Standard and Study Registration This trial is conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and has been approved by the Ethical Committee of The First Affiliated Hospital of Jiaxing University (approval number: LS2020-259). Each participant will be notified regarding the details of the study protocol. The study protocol has been registered in the clinicaltrials registry, with the identification number NCT0464088.Informed Consent All participants will be given enough time to decide whether to engage in this trial. Patients who participate in this trial will be entitled to the right to achieve all relevant information of the trial, including the benefits or potential risk, and they will be allowed to drop out according to their consent or to discontinue their participation at any point of the study. The confidentiality of all the participant records will be protected. All participants should provide written informed consents if they are included in the trial.Study Procedure The duration of the trial will include three study phases, including a 4-week screening and baseline phase (week -4 to week 0), an 8-week treatment phase (weeks 1-8), and a 16-week follow-up phase (weeks 9-24). If the participants have an interest to take part in this trial, the researchers will interview their medical history in a screening form. For potentially eligible subjects, they will be instructed to continually keep a patient diary for 4 weeks, which is mainly designed to record details including the number and days of vertigo/migraine attacks, duration, frequency, vertigo severity, migraine intensity, and dose of rescue medication. Subsequently, they will be invited to attend an eligibility assessment to determine whether they can be included in the trial by the study investigators.Participant Enrollment A target sample of 72 participants will be recruited in the acupuncture clinic and neurology clinic at The First Affiliated Hospital of Jiaxing University. The trial will be started from January 2021 to December 2023. Two major strategies will be used to recruit participants with VM. One is to recruit participants in outpatient clinics from the hospital mentioned above. The other is to show recruitment advertisements outside the clinics and through official media platform, which include roll-up banners, WeChat official accounts, and newspapers. The advertisements will contain brief introductions about the inclusion criteria, the population needed to be involved, and the contact information of the researcher.Study Population Inclusion Criteria (1) The age is between 18 and 80, and gender is not limited.Randomization and Allocation Concealment Eligible participants will be assigned randomly into the acupuncture group or the control group according to a table of random numbers, which is generated using Statistical Product and Service Solutions software V25.0 (SPSS V25.0). To guarantee allocation concealment, random sequence will be created and kept secure by a specially designated coordinator who will not participate in other procedures of the trial. The randomization list will only be seen by this specially designated coordinator and will be concealed from other researchers. Grouping information will be hidden using sequentially numbered, opaque, and sealed envelopes. The researchers need to contact the designated coordinator by telephone to obtain the corresponding random number and grouping information for each included participant.Blinding Owing to the complete difference between the two therapies in the two groups (i.e., acupuncture vs. pharmaceutical therapy), the participants will not be blinded in our study. Meanwhile, it is also impractical to blind the acupuncture operators due to the nature of the acupuncture procedure. Nevertheless, the goal of blinding is to eliminate the influence of subjective factors from study subjects and researchers on the study results. With the attempt to minimize the subjective influence, the treatment, outcome assessment, and statistical analysis will be performed by independent researchers in our study. Statisticians and data managers who collect data and assess outcomes will be blinded to the grouping information by third-party independent personnel.InterventionsAcupuncture Group This group will include 36 VM patients. The participants in this group will receive acupuncture treatment for 8 weeks. The participants in the treatment group are not allowed to take prophylactic medications, but in case of intolerable acute VM attacks, the participants in the acupuncture group will be instructed to take triptans as rescue medication, and the dosage of medication will be documented in detail in the medical diary by the patient.Acupoint Selection The rationales for the acupoint selection are based on consensus with experienced acupuncture experts, which target at alleviating major symptoms (i.e., migraine and vertigo/dizziness) and common comorbidities (i.e., emotional disorders) in VM patients. The acupoint selection of our study is highly overlapping with that in previously published trials involving acupuncture for treating migraine (14, 15) , vertigo/dizziness (13, 25) , and emotional disorders (16) . As shown in Table 2 , the selected acupoints include Baihui (DU20), Qianding (DU21), Yintang (EX-HN3), Fengchi (GB20), Shuaigu (GB8), Hegu (LI4), Neiguan (PC6), Shenmen (HT7), Fenglong (ST40), and Taichong (LR3). The location standard of the acupoints is based on the WHO standard for acupuncture point location (26).Procedures The acupuncturist will insert sterile, single-use filiform acupuncture needles (length, 40 mm; diameter, 0.30 mm) after disinfecting the skin. The needles used are Hwato needles (Suzhou Hwato Medical Instruments Co., China). Insertion will be followed by the classical needle stimulation methods of lifting/thrusting and twirling/rotating to produce a sensation known as Deqi (a compositional sensation including soreness, numbness, distention, and heaviness). Some acupoints, such as DU20 and DU21, are located beneath the scalp, which could be needled followed by the stimulation methods of pulling and pushing to reinforce a Deqi sensation. The patients in this group will receive acupuncture once every other day (3 days per week) over an 8-week period (a total of 24 sessions). In each session, the needles will be retained for 30 min.Medication Group This group will include 36 VM patients. The participants in this group will receive an oral administration of venlafaxine at 50 mg once a day for 8 weeks. The reasons for selecting the dose of 50 mg in this study are based on clinical experience and results from a previous study, which revealed that a lower dose (e.g., 37.5 mg) of venlafaxine had a favorable therapeutic effect in the prophylaxis of VM (27) . Additionally, a lower dose is likely to have less serious side effects when compared with a higher dose. In case of intolerable acute VM attacks, the participants will be instructed to take triptans as rescue medication, and the dosageAcupoints Location Baihui (DU20) On the head, 5.0 cun directly above the midpoint of the anterior hairline, or at the midpoint of the line connecting the apexes of the two auricles Qianding (DU21) On the head, 3.5 cun directly above the midpoint of the anterior hairline,Outcomes All outcomes will be assessed at baseline (4 weeks before randomization), at 4 and 8 weeks after intervention, and at 4, 8, and 16 weeks of follow-up.Primary Outcome Measures (1) Change in the number of vertigo/migraine days and vertigo/migraine attacks per 4 weeks from baseline: All participants will be instructed to keep a medical diary to record the number of vertigo/migraine days and vertigo/migraine attacks. (2) Change in vertigo severity per 4 weeks from baseline: Vertigo severity will be measured by the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI). DHI is a well-accepted questionnaire with 25 items and developed to assess the maiming and handicapping impact of dizziness (28) . The total DHI index ranges from 0 to 100 (best to worst) to measure the overall severity of vertigo, which include physical, emotional, and functional three dimensions, and the higher the score, the greater effect to the patients. (3) Change in migraine intensity per 4 weeks from baseline: Migraine intensity will be measured by a 10-point Visual Analog Scale (VAS). VAS is the most widely used scale for estimating subjective symptoms, including migraine intensity. The study subjects will use 0-10 (0: no symptoms, 10: most severe symptoms) to rate the intensity of migraine (29, 30) .Secondary Outcome Measures (1) Change in doses of rescue medication: Doses of rescue medication (i.e., triptans) will be documented by patients in the medical diary. ( 2 ) Change in anxiety level per 4 weeks from baseline: Anxiety level will be measured by Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale. The GAD-7 is a valid and reliable tool to measure general anxiety symptoms over the past 2 weeks across varied settings and populations (31) . A total of seven questions, with frequencies of 0-3, are adopted to assess the presence and severity of anxiety based on the patient's condition, with 0-4 being no GAD, 5-9 being mild GAD, 10-14 being moderate GAD, and 15-21 being severe GAD (32) . ( 3 ) Change in depression level per 4 weeks from baseline: Depression level will be measured by Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) scale. The PHQ-9 is generally used to measure depression symptoms over the past 2 weeks with well-established validity and reliability (33) . It includes a total of nine questions-the higher the score, the more depressed (34) . ( 4 ) Change in quality of life per 4 weeks from baseline: Quality of life will be measured by the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36). The SF-36 is a tool to evaluate general healthbased analysis of life condition in three aspects (functional ability, wellbeing, and overall health) over the past 4 weeks (35) . The validity and reliability of SF-36 for measuring quality of life have been proven (36) .Safety Evaluation Safety evaluation will be performed based on the number of adverse events (AEs). The participants will report any AE that they experience during the study phase, including acupuncture-related AEs (e.g., discomfort or bruising at the site of needle insertion, vertigo/dizziness, nausea, feeling faint after each treatment, etc.) and drug-related AEs (e.g., dyspepsia, paresthesia, dry mouth, nausea, and somnolence).Quality Control We will take multiple measures to enhance quality control throughout the entire trial process. Prior to the study, we will organize an intensive trial training to ensure that all researchers fully understand the trial protocol, standard operating procedures, and their corresponding roles-for example, all outcome assessors will be trained to perform outcome assessments and fill in the case report forms (CRFs) uniformly. All involved licensed acupuncturists are required to have at least 10 years of clinical experience and will be trained in acupuncture procedure to reduce operation bias as much as possible, especially in positioning of acupoints and acupuncture manipulations. During the study, we will periodically inspect the implementation of the trial to minimize the occurrence of AEs or complications as much as possible. The reason for dropout or withdrawal will be documented in CRFs. A thirdparty data safety monitoring committee will be employed to monitor the reliability of the data. They have the right to verify the authenticity and consistency between raw data and recorded data. Meanwhile, all major investigators will organize periodical meetings to discuss issues that will arise during the trial and figure out the best solutions. Moreover, in order to promote patient enrollment, all acupuncture treatment costs will be free for the included participants. At follow-up visits, economic compensation and health education will be adopted to improve patient compliance and reduce dropouts during a long period of 16-week follow-ups.Sample Size Estimation Power Analysis and Sample Size for Windows (NCSS, Kaysville, Utah, USA; PASS version 15.0) software is used to calculate the required sample size. Owing to the lack of previously published relevant RCTs, the sample size calculation is estimated based on the results of our pilot study. The participants will be divided into two groups in a 1:1 ratio. It is assumed that the mean of the number of vertigo days at 8 weeks after intervention will be 2.2 in the acupuncture group and 3.3 in the control groups, with a pooled standard deviation of 1.54. Given a difference in vertigo days of 1.1 between the two groups and a statistical power of 0.8 to reject a null effect at the 0.05 significance level, the required sample size of each group is 31. Considering an estimated attrition rate of 15%, each group will include 36 initial participants; thereby, a total of 72 participants are needed.Statistical Analysis Statistical software package SPSS19.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) will be adopted to conduct the statistical analysis. The statistical analysis will be conducted based on the intention-totreat principle by third-party statisticians who are blinded to the group allocation and intervention process. Missing data will be imputed by the last-observation-carried-forward method. Regarding categorical data, these will be displayed as counts and percentages. Numeric data with normal distribution will be expressed as mean ± standard deviations, while data with non-normal distribution will be expressed as median with 95% confidence intervals. For the data in normal distribution, repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used to perform within-group and between-group comparison by assessing change in continuous variables before and after intervention at different time points, while non-parametric test will be adopted to conduct within-group and betweengroup comparison for data in on-normal distribution. All hypothesis tests will be bilateral, with p-value < 0.05 considered statistically significant.DISCUSSION To date, there has not been a universally approved treatment for VM treatment, and VM remains difficult to manage by current treatment options (37) . Thus, it is critical to seek an effective and safe non-pharmacological therapy for VM prophylaxis, which can improve the quality of life of VM patients and reduce the side effects of pharmacotherapies and medical expense. On one hand, increasing the trials has favored the therapeutic effect of acupuncture for treating the major symptoms [i.e., vertigo/dizziness (13, 25) and migraine (14, 15) ] and common comorbidities [e.g., anxiety (16) and depression (17) ] of VM. On the other hand, although the pathogenesis of VM remains inconclusive, it is not only related to the central system but also a kind of recurrent peripheral vestibular disorders (9, 38) . Emerging studies (18, 19) have also revealed that VM is related to the dysfunction of the connection between the trigeminalvestibular-vagus nerves, and cumulative evidence demonstrates that acupuncture can relieve the symptoms of patients via mediating neural plasticity (20) . In this scenario, acupuncture may be a potential treatment option for VM prophylaxis, but current evidence remains insufficient. Therefore, the present protocol of a RCT aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture in the prophylactic treatment of VM patients, which is the first RCT in the acupuncture field. Given that the acupoint selection has a close correlation with the efficacy maximization of acupuncture, the acupoint prescription of our study is carefully schemed. The rationales for the acupoint prescription are mainly based on consensus with experienced acupuncture experts, which are highly overlapping with those adopted in previously published trials involving acupuncture for treating migraine (15) , vertigo/dizziness (13), and emotional disorders (16, 17) . The acupoint selection in our study targets at alleviating major symptoms (i.e., migraine and vertigo/dizziness) and common comorbidities (i.e., emotional disorders) in VM patients, given that VM affects both the central and peripheral parts of the nervous system and previous studies revealed that Du meridian plays a vital role in treating various nervous system diseases (39, 40) , including vertigo and headache. Accordingly, one important part of our acupoint prescription is to select acupoints of Du meridian [i.e., Baihui (DU20), Qianding (DU21)]. Meanwhile, migraine is one of the major symptoms of VM, and according to the theory of TCM, migraine belongs to shaoyang headache, which is corresponding to the gallbladder meridian. Thus, acupoints located in the gallbladder meridian [i.e., Fengchi (GB20), Shuaigu (GB8)] are another important part of our acupoint prescription. Moreover, a great number of experimental and clinical trials reveal the therapeutic effect of acupoints on Du meridian and gallbladder meridian, such as Baihui (DU20) (41) and Fengchi (GB20) (42) , for relieving vertigo and migraine, which are two major symptoms in VM patients. In addition, the remaining acupoints [e.g., Yintang (EX-HN3), Neiguan (PC6), Shenmen (HT7), and Taichong (LR3)] are selected to treat clinical symptoms related to psychological disorders, which are common comorbidities in VM patients. As the controlled arm, venlafaxine is a drug classified as serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, which is widely used to treat depression (43) . In recent years, the results of increasing RCTs have favored the efficacy of venlafaxine in the prophylaxis of VM (44) . Therefore, we compare the efficacy and safety of acupuncture with venlafaxine, which is chosen as a standard drug therapy in the control group. It is noteworthy that, owing to two major considerations, sham acupuncture is not selected as the control arm in our study. First, given that acupuncture is very popular and widely used in the hospital that recruited the participants, the overwhelming majority of the study subjects have accumulated a rich experience of acupuncture, which makes successful participant blinding very difficult even if a sham acupuncture group is adopted. Second, despite the fact that sham acupuncture remains to be identified as the method of controlling acupuncture to blind the study subjects and control the non-specific placebo effects, distinguishing between the specific and non-specific effects of acupuncture via sham control seems to be impossible. Until now, mimicking acupuncture without any physiological activity is still impractical. Many studies indicate that all currently available modalities of sham acupuncture (regarding penetrating or nonpenetrating) are not absolutely inert and have positive treatment effects (45) (46) (47) . In this case, the overall therapeutic effect of acupuncture may be greatly underestimated if it is compared with sham acupuncture, especially in trials that aim to evaluate the effect of acupuncture for treating pain conditions (48) . Therefore, some scholars debate that the complex and multielement characteristics of acupuncture doom the design of sham acupuncture and that the great effort to control the psychological (non-specific) factors through currently available modalities of sham acupuncture might be unnecessary and unsuccessful (49) . In this scenario, we do not set up a sham acupuncture group as the control in our study. There are several limitations of our study. First, with a lack of objective measurement indicators, till now the diagnostic criteria of VM have been relatively subjective. Meanwhile, its major clinical feature of vertigo is a very subjective symptom; a lot of patients cannot describe it clearly, especially old people, thereby making it difficult to diagnose and judge a therapeutic effect. These factors will have an impact on participant inclusion and outcome assessments. Second, given that there is great lack of previously published relevant RCTs, our sample size is estimated according to our pilot study. Nevertheless, our trial will provide effect size data for sample size calculations of future large-scale RCTs. Third, although sham acupuncture is not adopted as the control, owing to the aforementioned considerations, the psychological (non-specific) effect of acupuncture in treating VM cannot be completely eliminated, owing to the lack of sham acupuncture. Thus, when the trial is finished and the results are interpreted, particular considerations should be given to the psychological (non-specific) effects of acupuncture that may influence the treatment effect.FIGURE 1 | 1 FIGURE 1 | Flow diagram of the study procedure.( 2 )( 1 ) 21 Patients meet the VM diagnostic criteria proposed by the collaboration of Barany Society and the International Headache Society in 2012 (24) .

Nowadays, inspiratory muscle training can be geared toward strength or endurance gains. This study aims to investigate the effects of an inspiratory muscle training (IMT) protocol using different therapeutic modalities to be implemented in pulmonary rehabilitation programs. The effects of IMT on exercise capacity were considered as the primary endpoint, and the effects of IMT on inspiratory muscle function, health-related quality of life, and daily physical activity level were considered as the secondary outcomes. Methods: This study is a blinded-investigator randomized controlled clinical trial. Sixty subjects will be randomly allocated into three groups: (1) pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) associated with inspiratory muscle training without any load (PRWIMT), (2) PR associated with inspiratory muscle training with a linear load (PRIMTLL), and (3) PR associated with inspiratory muscle training with isocapnic voluntary hyperpnea (PRIMTIVH). The protocol will be performed 5 days a week (3 days with supervision) for 10 weeks. The study will assess anthropometric data, lung function, respiratory muscle strength, and functional capacity by the Incremental Shuttle Walking Test and the Six-Minute Walk Test, lung volumes during the submaximal endurance test, peripheral muscle strength of the upper and lower limbs, dyspnea, and quality of life related to health, before and after the training protocol. Normality will be tested using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, and variables will be compared by two-way analysis of variance. The significance level was set at p < 0.05. Ethics approval was obtained from the Institutional Ethics Committee in Research (1.663.411). The study results will be disseminated through presentation at specific scientific conferences and publication in peer-reviewed journals.","The study has the following strengths: The study is an investigator-blinded randomized controlled trial designed to aid in better understanding further effects that inspiratory muscle training (IMT) may add to conventional pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) programs. The subjects will be reevaluated after the protocol by an evaluator blinded to the intervention protocol allocation to describe the effects of different IMT modalities on exercise capacity. One limitation of the study is that the training protocol will be partially performed at home by the studied subjects without clinical supervision.Background Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic, preventable, and treatable disease that is characterized by persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow limitations; the primary triggering factor is significant long-term exposure to noxious particles or gases, which produce airway and/or alveolar airway changes [1] . The disease presents extrapulmonary manifestations such as skeletal muscle dysfunction, which is an important prognostic factor that justifies exercise intolerance in these patients [2] . In addition to pharmacological treatment, it is recommended that individuals with COPD take part in PR programs. Nowadays, PR is defined as an embracing intervention based on the complete evaluation of the patient followed by specific therapies that include but are not limited to training, education, and behavior changes, aiming to improve the physical performance and psychological status of individuals with chronic respiratory disease and to promote long-term adherence and behavior changes [3] . IMT may generate strength increase in patients with COPD; however, studies have shown that the training may overload these muscles when not well performed [4] . Although decades have passed with several studies about IMT in patients with COPD being conducted, there are still doubts regarding IMT efficiency and its influence on exercise tolerance in COPD subjects. Studies have shown that IMT does not determine exercise performance improvement in COPD, or that there is a weak correlation between respiratory muscle changes due to IMT and exercise performance [5] . The literature describes two modalities of respiratory muscle training: isocapnic voluntary hyperpnea, which consists of a training that requires the individual to perform voluntary hyperventilation during a certain period of time, maintaining an isocapnea [6] ; and threshold valves of pressure loading, which require the individual to perform inspirations or expirations against resistance [7] . This device allows inspirations and expirations to be forced by the device, which causes selective strengthening of the respiratory muscles and mobilizes the entire rib cage. Studies show that therapy with isocapnic voluntary hyperpnea reduces dyspnea and improves exercise capacity and the quality of life of subjects [8] . Currently, the market has electronic IMT valves that seem to provide some benefits in relation to volume increase during training compared to mechanical valves; however, these effects have not yet been clinically demonstrated [9] . There have been, to date, disagreements over the effects of IMT in individuals with COPD [8] . Due to different results on the effect of IMT in COPD subjects, the aim of this study will be to investigate the effects of an IMT protocol to be included in PR programs. The first outcome will be the effects of the training on exercise capacity. Training on inspiratory muscle function (strength and resistance), state of health, and dyspnea level will be considered as secondary outcomes. We believe that the different protocols used in our study are able to guide physiotherapists with regard to the most effective type of IMT, as well as to elucidate the effects of IMT on exercise tolerance, to identify if there is any repercussion on strength and the resistance of the respiratory muscles when subjected to different training types. In addition, the best IMT modality can be included in conventional PR programs, allowing optimization of the therapeutic management of patients with COPD. One also hopes that these results will endorse adjustments to the modalities used to strengthen respiratory muscles, as we believe that a well-implemented therapeutic program can reduce morbidity/mortality rates in these individuals as well as improve their quality of life.MethodsStudy This is a blinded randomized controlled clinical trial. The PR program will be performed by a respiratory therapist. Initial and final assessment will be performed by another previously trained respiratory therapist who will be blinded to the allocation groups in accordance with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) [10] and Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) [11] .Subjects Individuals with a clinical diagnosis of COPD according to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) being treated at the Ambulatory Pulmonology department of University Hospital Onofre Lopes (HUOL)/Empresa Brasileira de Serviços Hospitalares (EBSERH) will be invited to participate in the study. All selected individuals will be assessed at the PneumoCardioVascular Lab HUOL/EBSERH to confirm disease stage. Patients in clinical follow-up with a specialized pulmonology physician and with use of adequate bronchodilation (modified Medical Research Council [mMRC] score ≥ 2/4), who are aged between 40 and 80 years, living in the city of Natal, RN/Brazil, not using oxygen therapy or presenting disease exacerbation in the last 3 months, and not practicing regular physical activity in the last 6 months will be eligible to participate. Subjects presenting musculoskeletal comorbidities that impair the subject's gait, peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) < 90% during the Six-Minute Walk Test (6MWT), hypertensive subjects without control medication as well as those presenting with a hypertensive peak (> 140/90 mmHg) [12] for more than 3 consecutive days, those with an intellectual understanding impairment that interferes with the evaluation tests, or those who stop the therapeutic program, miss activity for more than 1 week, or miss reevaluation will be excluded from the study.Study design After recruitment, subjects will be invited to attend the PneumoCardioVascular and Respiratory Muscle Performance Laboratory HUOL/EBSERH to perform an initial evaluation. The assessment will be performed by a previously trained evaluator blinded to the intervention allocation group and will include anthropometry, lung function, respiratory muscle strength, exercise capacity, lung volumes associated with the submaximal endurance test, peripheral muscle strength (upper and lower limbs), dyspnea, and impact of COPD on a person's life. After evaluation, a secure web-based randomization system (randomization.com) will be used to allocate subjects into three groups: the PRWIMT group will perform PR and IMT without any load; the PRIMTLL group will perform PR and IMT with a linear load, and the PRIMTIVH group will perform PR and IMT with isocapnic voluntary hyperpnea. The web-based randomization firstly generates a list of numbers from 1 to 60. These numbers are randomized into the study groups to which the subjects will be numerically allocated in order of arrival. After the intervention period, a blind evaluator to the intervention groups, as represented in Fig. 1 , the flow diagram of the intervention protocols, will reevaluate all cases, according to the schedule of the study in Fig. 2 . The SPIRIT checklist is provided as Additional file 1.Fig. 1 Flow diagram of intervention protocolsInterventionPulmonary rehabilitation program and respiratory muscle training The PR protocol will be performed three times a week for 10 consecutive weeks. All activities will be supervised by a previously trained respiratory therapist in a room with a controlled temperature set between 23 and 26 °C. All individuals will be instructed to perform the rehabilitation program 5 days a week -3 days with supervision and 2 without supervisionfor at least one hour a day, according to the recommendations of the guideline on PR in adults [13] . Subjects will receive orientation to fill in the unsupervised exercise diary regarding type of exercise, duration, and frequency as well as for symptoms referenced during the activity using the modified Borg scale (from 4 to 6) to limit the intensity of the exercise [14] . All three groups will submit to a conventional rehabilitation program consisting of aerobic exercise on a treadmill. For the first week, the subjects will perform 20 min of activity. A resting period lasting 2 min maximum will be allowed whenever requested by the subject. The training time will be increased after the 5th week to reach 30 min of daily activity [15] . Aerobic exercise will be performed on a treadmill, with a velocity corresponding to 70% of the maximum velocity achieved in the Incremental Shuttle Walking Test (ISWT) [16] . Ten percent of the starting time (2-3 min) of the training will be at a speed of 40% of the maximum speed reached in the ISWT for heating, 80% of the training time (17-25 min) will be at the target speed (70% ISWT), and the remaining 10% of the time will be cooling, with the same speed as for heating, reducing the speed to zero at the end of the training period [17, 18] . The physical activity training will be interrupted whenever the degree of dyspnea sensation reaches 4-6 (intense) on the Borg scale [14] or the heart rate (HR) exceeds 85% of the individual maximum HR value (220age). If the saturation drops (SpO 2 < 90%) [19] during the exercise, we will administer supplemental Fig. 2 Schedule of the study oxygen at minimal flow with a nasal cannula to maintain higher than 90% saturation. The patients will be monitored every 5 min. Participants will be instructed to maintain aerobic activities on days that they are not performing the supervised PR program. Strength training for lower and upper limb muscles will be performed through a program consisting of 3 sets of 12 repetitions, initially using 60% of 1 maximal repetition (1RM), and this load will be increased to 70% by the 5th week and 80% in the 8th week of training [20] . For the upper limbs the training will be directed to the biceps, triceps, pectoral, and deltoid muscles, and for the lower limbs, the training will be for quadriceps and triceps femoris [3] . Guidance in energy conservation techniques as well as educational speeches regarding self-management of the disease will be provided [13] . The PRWIMT group will perform PR and IMT without any load; the PRIMTLL group will perform PR and IMT with a linear load; the PRIMTIVH group will perform PR and IMT with isocapnic voluntary hyperpnea.PRWIMT protocol The PRWIMT protocol consists of conventional PR as previously described. Individuals will also perform a placebo IMT using a POWERbreathe® device (POWERbreathe International Ltd., Southam, UK) without any load for 3 cycles of 12 repetitions.PRIMTLL protocol The PRIMTLL protocol consists of conventional PR and the use of POWERbreathe®. POWERbreathe KH1 (POWERbreathe International Ltd.) will be used for IMT. This equipment is based on resistance training to inspiration and consists of a mouthpiece coupled to the equipment, which will electronically generate inspiratory resistance to the exercise. POWERbreathe KH1 performs an automatic estimate of the patient's load necessity at the beginning of each session [21] . Respiratory muscle training will be performed using 35% of maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP), increasing 5% every week until reaching 80% of MIP at the 10th week, which will be maintained until the end of the protocol. The MIP will be accessed weekly to adjust the training load percentage. Subjects will perform 3 cycles of 12 repetitions as proposed by Huang et al. [22] .PRIMTIVH protocol The PRIMTIVH protocol consists of conventional PR and IMT using an STMedical® device (SpiroTiger, Chamonix Mont Blanc, France). Respiratory muscle training in voluntary isocapnic hyperventilation mode will be performed with the STMedical® device Pulmonary Rehabilitation Maximal Voluntary Hyperpnea (PRMVH), consisting of a portable unit with a pouch and a base station. A two-way piston valve is connected to a rebreathing bag, which maintains a constant isocapnic fraction of carbon dioxide [23] . Individuals will receive training with duration up to 20 min, one minute of training and one minute of rest, where they will be encouraged with instructions such as ""breathe faster."" The training respiratory rate chosen will be calculated as 35-fold forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV 1 ), so that ventilation corresponds to 50-60% of maximal voluntary ventilation (MVV) [24] . They will start with a respiratory rate (RR) between 26 and 30 bpm lasting for 1 min, until completion of 20 min of training with the target RR. The volume of the rebreathing bag will be based on the forced vital capacity (FVC) of the patient, starting with a rebreathing bag size approximately equivalent to 50-60% of the FVC [25, 26] .Outcome measures Anthropometric assessment Patients will be assessed for their height and body weight through an anthropometric scale coupled with a Filizola stadiometer (Filizola PL200®, São Paulo, Brazil) and a maximum capacity of 200 kg in order to calculate body mass index (BMI). As proposed by Quetelet (1835), BMI has been used by the World Health Organization (WHO) since 1997 as a reference measure of obesity worldwide and is expressed as the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters (weight/height 2 ) [27] .Lung function test Lung function will be assessed using a KoKo DigiDoser spirometer (Nspire Health, Longmont, CO, USA). Technical procedures, acceptability, and reproducibility will follow the recommendations of the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) [28] . Subjects will perform between three to eight maneuvers, and the best three will be recorded with variability less than 5% or 200 ml. The test will be performed before and after the use of an inhalation bronchodilator. Absolute and predicted values of FEV 1 , FVC, and FEV 1 /FVC will be considered and analyzed using a previously published equation for the study population [29] . The dynamic muscular endurance test (MVV) will also be performed. The dynamic test will be performed by MVV during 15 s (MVV 15s ) using a KoKo DigiDoser spirometer (Nspire Health). The individual will be positioned in a seated position on a bench with a nose clip and will be instructed before the beginning of the test to ""breathe as fast and deep as possible."" During the test, active stimulation will be carried out with the cadence ""pull and drop, pull and drop"" to maintain a constant and regular rhythm with the same volume and frequency during the whole test. The maneuver will be assessed by three tests of 15 s. The highest value will be considered the best test. A difference less than 10% among the tests will be set [28, 29] . Maximal respiratory pressure, sniff nasal inspiratory pressure (SNIP), and sustained maximum inspiratory pressure (SPImax) Respiratory muscle strength will be measured using a MicroRPM digital manometer (NEPEB-LabCare/UFMG, produced in Belo Horizonte, Brazil). Technical procedures, acceptability, and reproducibility will follow the recommendations of the ATS/ERS (2002) [30] . To obtain MIP, the individual will be instructed to perform one maximal expiration (close to residual volume, RV) followed by a maximal inspiration (close to total lung capacity, TLC). To obtain maximal expiratory capacity (MEP), the individual will be instructed to perform a maximal inspiration (close to TLC) followed by a maximal expiration (close to RV) [31] . A maximum of five maneuvers will be performed for each evaluation, and the highest value will be considered so that the difference among the maneuvers does not exceed 10% among the best three tests. Obtained values will be compared to reference values for the Brazilian population [32] . The SNIP, or sniff, test will be performed with one nostril occluded by a nose clip connected to the manometer through a catheter measuring approximately 1 mm. The maneuver will be performed from functional residual capacity (FRC). The individual will be instructed to perform a slow sustained expiration followed by a maximal sniff (inspiration) through the contralateral nostril. All subjects will perform 10 maneuvers with a 30-s interval among them [33] . The highest maneuver will be compared to previously described equations to determine reference values for the studied population [34] . To measure SPImax, the same manometer will be used. The manometer will be connected to a diver through an acrylic piece with an air leak orifice of 2 mm and a 6-mm occlusion orifice. The manometer will communicate with software (Manovac 3.0-A), whereby the data will be accessed after being collected [35] [36] [37] . Individuals will be instructed to breathe quietly close to tidal volume through the nozzle connected to the manometer for three consecutive breaths. The evaluator will give the following verbal command: ""Push the air out, push the air into ... "". The next steps are as follows: (1) slow exhalation, close to the residual volume at the verbal command ""Push all the air out ... ""; (2) signaling the end of the total and slow exhalation by the patient, shown by raising the left arm; (3) obstruction of the occlusion hole by the evaluator, and (4) achieving a maximum inspiratory effort, near to total lung capacity, which will be sustained as long as possible, at the command: ""Take a deep breath! And hold it, hold it ... ... ... hold it"" [30, 37, 38] . The test will be considered complete when the subject performs at least three acceptable efforts, which means with no air leakage between the lips and the mouthpiece and/or nose clip, and of these, two reproducible efforts (with variation equal to or less than 10% of the test, with the variable area under the pressure-time curve value, since it was not the last test). Up to eight inspiratory efforts will be performed, with a one-minute interval between the tests [39] .Assessment of chest wall volumes Analysis of respiratory kinematics integrated to signals of lung volumes, flow, pressure, and respiratory muscle activity will be assessed during a spirogram (one minute of quiet breathing [QB] followed by a maximum respiratory cycle, 20 s of QB, a maximum voluntary ventilation for 15 s, and one minute of QB). All signals will be integrated using Optoelectronic Plethysmography (OEP) System; BTS, Milan, Italy). The evaluation of flow and pressure generated in the airways will be performed using a Series 0-800 lpm pneumotachograph (flow measurement head), interconnected to a Series RSS100HR amplifier (Research Pneumotach System, Hans Rudolph, Inc.; Shawnee, KS, USA). The chest wall volumes and its compartments (rib cage pulmonary, rib cage abdominal, and abdomen) will be assessed by OEP System. This system allows the computational kinematic analysis of the three dimensions of the chest wall complex through 89 optical sensors placed on the chest wall. The sensors, small hemispheres (5 mm in diameter) coated with a reflective substance, will be circumferentially placed on the three horizontal regions of the chest wall between the collarbone and the superior iliac spine. Sensors will be placed in five vertical columns on the anterior and posterior regions and in two additional columns on the axillary line [40] [41] [42] [43] . The limit between the pulmonary and abdominal rib cage will be assumed at the xiphoid process level, and the limit between the abdominal rib cage and abdomen will be assumed as the lower anterior costal margin and lower posterior costal margin. Coordinates of the sensors will be assessed by using a kinematic configuration system in eight photosensitive cameras (four on the front region and four on the back region) with an acquisition frequency of 60 Hz. Based on the captured images, the volumes of the chest wall will be computed by a triangulation surface. Respiratory pattern volume, flow, and time will be considered for the analysis. Additionally, operational volumes (end inspiratory volume and end expiratory volume) will be evaluated [44] .Peripheral muscle strength Upper limb muscle strength will be obtained by hand dynamometry on the dominant side using Jamar equipment (Sammons Preston, Bolingbrook, IL, USA). Three reproducible tests will be performed (≤ 5%), and the highest obtained value will be considered for analysis using a previously described reference equation [45] . Lower limb muscle strength will be assessed using the maximal repetition (MR) test of the dominant limb on an extension board (405 Embreex Physicus, Brazil) with a load capacity of 50 kg [46] .Six-Minute Walk Test (6MWT) and Incremental Shuttle Walking Test (ISWT) The 6MWT will be performed following the technical procedures described by the ATS [47] . Respiratory rate, heart rate, and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) by portable pulse oximeter (Nonim Medical, Inc., 2500A, Plymouth, MN, USA) and systemic arterial pressure (SAP) using an analogue tensiometer (Becton Dickinson -BD®, Brazil) and a stethoscope (Littmann® classic II, 3M, Saint Paul, MN, USA) will be assessed before, immediately after, and 2 min after the end of the test. The subjective symptoms of dyspnea and fatigue of lower limbs will be evaluated with the modified Borg scale, from 0 to 10 [14] . Heart rate and SpO 2 will be monitored every minute during the test. At the end of the test, the total distance walked will be calculated, and the equation of Iwama et al. [48] will be used to calculate the predicted walking distance during the test. To evaluate the maximum work (Wmax) performed during the 6MWT, the equation proposed by Hill et al. [49] , which is based on the subject's body weight, will be used. The predicted values of distance will be calculated according to Iwama et al. [48] . The ISWT will be performed according to Singh et al. [50] . The test will be interrupted by subject exhaustion or if the individual is not able to keep the proposed speed. Respiratory and cardiac frequency, SpO 2 , SAP, and subjective symptoms of dyspnea and lower limb fatigue will be measured before and after the test with the modified Borg scale [14, 51] . The equation of Probst et al. [52] will be used to calculate predictive walking distance in the study.Dyspnea and health status Perceived dyspnea will be evaluated by the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) scale, which has five different items in which the subject chooses the one that corresponds to the limitation caused by dyspnea in their activities of daily living (ADL) [53] . The Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Assessment Test (CAT) aims to determine the impact of COPD on health status [54] . This questionnaire is simple and easy to apply, consisting of 8 questions about general symptoms and limitation in ADL. The score varies from 0 to 5 points in each item, totaling a maximum of 40 points, and this score has been included in the new classification of patients with COPD, to direct medication treatment and define mortality risk. Lower scores correspond to a low impact of the disease on health status and scores above 10 are representative of patients with higher risk, with poorer health status due to COPD [1] . The Portuguese version will be used, validated for the Brazilian population [55] .Sample size The sample size was calculated using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures by analyzing walking distance and the standard deviation in meters on the 6MWT from previously published data [15] . A two-tailed alpha error of 0.01 was implemented with a power of 95%, considering clinical improvement for COPD patients after PR and a difference of 30 m between groups on the walking test. For the calculations, the following means and standard deviations of the time observed in the 6MWT in the rehabilitation and control groups were used: pre-PR 312.43 ± 51.26 and post-PR 342.85 ± 48.82 m (rehabilitation group); pre-PR 305.13 ± 54.60 and post-PR 298.20 ± 52.81 m (control group), and a sample size of 32 subjects was found (effect size = 1.04). As the study of Elci et al. [15] was composed of two groups (rehabilitation and controls) and ours will be composed of three groups, we will assume that the 32 subjects will be part of the rehabilitation program (the PRIMTLL and PRIMTIVH groups), and 16 more subjects will be added as a study control group for a total sample of 48 subjects. In addition, 12 more subjects will be added into the study, because we will also assume a 20% loss to follow-up as well as 5% missing data, for a total sample size of 60 subjects.Monitoring The research team is responsible for monitoring the study. At each supervised training session, participants will be asked if they have had any changes during the course of their activities, in addition to being monitored with parameters, as described previously, that may be implied in interruption of the activity or withdrawal of the subject from the PR program.Statistics analysis The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test will be performed to analyze sample normality, and two-way ANOVA followed by a Bonferroni post hoc test will be used to compare the differences among the groups. Data will be analyzed using the GraphPad Prism software version 5.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). The significance level was set at 95% (p ≤ 0.05).Dissemination The results found in this study will be presented in specific scientific conferences and will be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals.Discussion Literature data reporting the effects of respiratory muscle training regarding exercise tolerance are rare nowadays. We believe that the different protocols used in our study of high load and low load training will be able to guide respiratory therapists to the most effective respiratory muscle training type. Moreover, the study will elucidate the effects of IMT on exercise tolerance, identifying if there is any repercussion on both respiratory muscle static pressure and respiratory muscle strength when the patient is subjected to different efforts. Finally, the best IMT modality may be included in conventional PR programs, thus optimizing the therapeutic management of COPD patients. We also hope that these findings endorse adjustments to the modalities used for respiratory muscle strengthening, as we believe that a well-implemented therapeutic program may reduce the morbidity/mortality rates for these individuals as well as improve their quality of life. The protocol performance may show some limitations as individuals' adherence and subjects' access to the hospital will vary. Such limitations will be controlled by free specialized medical service and by the provision of a free bus pass allowing subjects to attend the interventions at the PR service. As clinical limitations we may highlight COPD exacerbation and/or other general clinical issues that may lead to a subject's absence of 3 or more consecutive days or subjects being withdrawn from the study.Trial status The trial is currently in recruitment phase at the Ambulatory Pulmonology department of University Hospital Onofre Lopes (HUOL)/Empresa Brasileira de Serviços Hospitalares (EBSERH). Recruitment will begin in July 2019, and the protocol is expected to finish in June 2020.Additional fileAdditional file 1 : 1 SPIRIT 2013 checklist: recommended items to address in a clinical trial protocol and related documents*.

University of Curtin Perth Australia,"Objective: The objective of this study was to identify the outcomes of short term inspiratory muscle training (IMT) combined with chest physiotherapy (CP) on lung function, inspiratory muscle strength, exercise tolerance and quality of life of COPD patients. Materials and Methods: This randomized-controlled trial was conducted at the Terendak Armed Forces Hospital, Melaka. Eighteen hospitalized COPD patients (FEV1 50% to = 80% predicted) were randomized into intervention (IG) and control group (CG). The IG received IMT and CP treatments whilst the CG received only CP for a period of 4 weeks. Assessments of lung function (FEV1/FVC), inspiratory muscle strength (PImax), exercise tolerance (6MWT) and quality of life (SGRQ score) were taken at baseline and after 4 weeks. Results: Analysis showed IG group increased in FEV1/FVC by 19.4%, PImax by 54.7%, 6MWT by 33.2% and quality of life by 52.6% (All, p<0.05). The control group increased in FEV1/FVC by 8.7% (p>0.05), PImax by 15% (p<0.05), 6MWT by 18.9% (p<0.05) and quality of life by 15.6% (p<0.05). Conclusion: The present study has established that by combining inspiratory muscle training (IMT) and chest physiotherapy, provides superior effects on lung function, inspiratory muscle strength, exercise tolerance and quality of life among COPD patients.","Introduction Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of chronic morbidity, world's 4th leading cause of mortality that will further increase in its prevalence in the succeeding decades (The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease. 1 The Regional Working Group for COPD 2 reported that more than 6.3% population aged 30 and above suffered from COPD ranged between stage II and III, in the Asia-Pacific countries. In addition, more than 4.7% Malaysian population were diagnosed with COPD every year. Smoking was known as one of the main factors contributing to COPD besides lungs infections and environmental pollution. 1 COPD is a progressive and irreversible lung disease characterized by airflow limitation, which is worse on expiration and may lead to compression of small airways, resulting in air trapping in the lungs and subsequent hyperinflation. 3 Prolonged inspiratory muscle dysfunction may further reduce inspiratory muscle strength and endurance that contribute to dyspnea, reduction in exercise tolerance and poor quality of life (QOL). 1, 4 Reduced lung ventilation or breathing capacity may act with coordination and interaction between neck, thorax, and abdominal muscles to alter the breathing pattern. Similiarly factors, such as postural alteration, restrictive pulmonary disorder, inspiratory muscle weakness and improper activation of accessory muscles during breathing can further augment COPD symptoms. 1 Pulmonary rehabilitation program that consist of physical exercise, health education, and psychosocial approach is normally practiced in treating COPD patients by physiotherapists and other health care providers.1 Improved lung function, exercise tolerance and reduction of COPD symptoms were noted after pulmonary rehabilitation program. 4 A systematic review has proposed that the use of IMT to be combined in the pulmonary rehabilitation in order to enhance lung function among patients with respiratory conditions. 3 Maximal inspiratory pressure (PImax) is commonly used to measure functional strength of the inspiratory muscles. 6 Hill et al 7 stated that when stimulus or load is placed on the respiratory muscles, it augments inspiratory muscle strength, increases exercise capacity and decreases dyspnea. Effectiveness of the techniques are observed both in pressure threshold or targeted resistive devices of IMT and it was proven safe, feasible, and effective to be used as the training mode. 8 In contrast, although previous systematic reviews show positive outcomes following IMT, 3, 9 but it is still inconclusive with regards to IMT guideline and protocol. 10 Different methodological approach especially in modes, intensity, duration, treatment-base and inconsistent findings were noted from the previous studies. 9 IMT efficacy is also influenced by the training intensity. A RCT study by Covey et al 11 demonstrated significant changes by 17% ± 17 cm H2O (p <.05) from baseline in inspiratory muscle strength, respiratory endurance by 43% ±13 cm H2O (p < .05) and dyspnea score of CRQ by 23.7% ± 5.2 (p < .05). This study implemented 30 minutes of 30% to 60% PImax for 16 weeks. In another RCT, they used 60% to 80% PImax for 8 weeks and produced significant changes in the outcomes. 3 Thus, there is a debate on the study methodological issues to which is the most effective guideline and protocol to be used in treating patients with respiratory conditions. On the other hand, early pulmonary rehabilitation programs which include aerobic and strength training, early ambulation, and with or without IMT has been shown to demonstrate positive outcomes in COPD patients. 12 Clini et al 13 found that early pulmonary rehabilitation just after, or even during an acute episode in the hospital is feasible and effective. In addition, many out-patient and home-based IMT programs were reported in the previous studies compared to hospitalized IMT program. 14 Thus, it is essential to identify the IMT outcomes as early as during patients' hospital admission to determine the needs for including the exercise training into the pulmonary rehabilitation protocol. Besides early program, duration of IMT may also influence the outcomes. 15 Most of the previous studies were between 6 weeks to 12 months duration of program.1,8 Effects of early program on hospitalized patients using IMT between 4 weeks to 3 months were not clearly defined in the previous studies. 16 The previous study reported research duration ranging from 6 to 24 months. 11, 15, 17, 18 However, none of the studies were short term and less than 6 weeks duration. Insufficient local data are available regarding the efficacy of short term IMT program. Thus, this requires urgency for future study to be carried out. As such, the objective of this study was to determine the outcomes of short term IMT. We hypothesized that combination IMT and chest physiotherapy treatments for a period of 4 weeks would have significant effects on lung function, inspiratory muscle strength, exercise tolerance and quality of life of hospitalized COPD patients.Materials and MethodsStudy design A prospective, single-blind randomized control trial (RCT) was carried out at Terendak Armed Forces Hospital, Melaka Malaysia. Subjects were among the hospitalized COPD patients who were diagnosed with mild to moderate COPD and referred by a respiratory physician for study enrolment. Lung function with FEV1 between 50% to = 80% predicted and FEV1/FVC < 0.70 without significant co morbidity were used as the study inclusion criteria. 1, 16, 19, 20 Eighteen COPD patients were enrolled as the subjects based on sample size calculation suggested by Snedecor and Cochran. 21 The subjects were blinded and randomly assigned into intervention (IG) and control (CG) groups via systematic randomization. Nine subjects were allocated to each group. The study was ethically approved by the hospital authority and medical research committee of Malaysia National University. Subjects were given the consent form to complete prior to the study.Intervention The intervention group (IG) received chest physiotherapy, which consisted of active cycle breathing The Outcomes of Short Term Inspiratory Muscle Training (IMT) Combined with Chest Physiotherapy technique (ACBT) and postural drainage (PD) for 15 minutes, once a day, 5 days a week for 4 weeks prior to the IMT. Then, they received inspiratory muscle training (IMT) for 15 minutes, once a day, 5 days a week for 4 weeks. IMT protocol was performed using a ""patient module of pressure threshold Respifit-S unit"" for 30 repetitions in 15 minutes with intensity of 30% of baseline maximum inspiratory pressure (PImax). IMT was progressed until 60% of subjects PImax with 10% resistance increment weekly. One day training was given to therapists and patients prior to the study. The control group (CG) received chest physiotherapy treatment only.Measures The study was done for 4 weeks, in which screening, pre and post test data were collected from both groups. Lungs function parameter such as FEV1, FEV1/FVC was measured using spirometry analyser Spirolab II; Medical International Research (MIR); Roma, Italy and Inspiratory muscle strength (PImax) was determined using Respifit-S model: E. Biegler Medizinelectronik, Mauerbach Austria. The distance achieved in 6 minute walking test (6MWT) was used to determine the exercise tolerance level as suggested by McGavin et al. 22 Quality of life (QOL) was measured using the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) which consisted of 3 domains and 1 total Score with score 0 represents the maximum quality of life (QOL) achieved and score 100 means worst QOL as proposed by Jones et al. 23Data Analysis Percentage of changes and mean (±SD) of FEV1/FVC, PImax, 6MWT distance achieved and SGRQ total score from baseline to 4 weeks of treatment were the outcomes of the study. Paired sample t tests were used to determine significant differences in the measured variables between baseline and posttest values. An alpha level of less than .05 was used for all statistical tests.Results All subjects completed the study without any dropouts reported. Demographic and health characteristics of the subjects are presented in Table 1 . There were no significant differences found between the groups at baseline in relation to age, body weight, body mass index and physical activity level. There was no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups at baseline with FEV1/FVC ranged from 0.20 to 0.44, 20.0 cmH2O to 50.0 cmH2O for PImax, 150 meter to 290 meter for 6MWT, and 41.68 % to 75.89 % for SGRQ. Paired sample t test was conducted to evaluate the significant changes of the 4-weeks study on FEV1/FVC, PImax, 6MWT and SGRQ. Findings for FEV1/FVC showed a significant increase for IG from baseline (M = 0.67, SD = 0.03) to post-test (M = 0.80, SD = 0.03, t8 =-3.93, P = 0.04). The control group showed no significant difference from baseline (M =0.69, SD = 0.04) to posttest (M =0.75, SD = 0.03, t8 = -1.94, P = 0.08). On an average, percentage of changes from baseline to post-test for the IMTG was 19.4%, whereas only 8.7% noted in the CG. Inspiratory muscle strength (PImax) of IG showed a significant increase between baseline (M = 26.2, SD Ahmad H, Justine M, Othman Z, Mohan V, Mirza FT = 9.20) and post-test (M = 38.4, SD = 20.5, t8 =-3.17, P = 0.013). The CG also showed significant improvement from baseline (M =21.3, SD = 1.80) to post-test (M =24.5, SD = 2.50, t8 = -4.72, P = 0.02). Percentage of changes from baseline to post-test for the IG was 46.6%, whereas only 15.0% in the CG. Exercise tolerance (6MWT) of IG showed a significant increase between baseline (M = 225.56, SD = 56.37) and post-test (M =300.56, SD = 61.56, t8= -8.58, P = 0.001), similarly for the CG from baseline (M =185.56, SD = 40.65) to post-test (M =220.56, SD = 40.41, t8 = -5.42, P = 0.01). Percentage of changes from baseline to post-test for the IMTG was 33.3%, whereas only 18.9% in the CPG. As for the quality of life (SGRQ), the IG showed a significant increase between baseline (M =60.34, SD = 10.64) and post-test (M =28.61, SD = 5.16, t8= 9.32, P = 0.001). The CG also showed significant improvement from baseline (M =60.67, SD = 8.47) to post-test (M =51.18, SD = 8.14, t8 =6.33, P = 0.01). Percentage of changes from baseline to posttest for the IMTG was 52.6%, whereas only 15.6% in the CPG. Table 2Discussion This study evaluated the effect of combination of short term IMT with chest physiotherapy treatments on clinical outcomes among hospitalized COPD patients. IMT appears to improve lung function, respiratory muscle strength, walking distance and health related quality of life in individuals with mild to moderate hospitalized COPD, but to date there is no clear best practice guideline on IMT training protocol published.10,24 The significant changes on the outcomes in this study could be influenced either by the IMT alone which comprised of frequency, intensity, type and duration in the protocol or combined IMT with other interventions. The findings of this study indicated that combined IMT with chest physiotherapy treatments which consists of ACBT and PD have shown significant improvement in the study outcomes. This outcome seems to be consistent with published systematic reviews that reported combined IMT with either one of these interventions. The intervention utilized includes upper and lower extremity aerobic exercise, strength training, pulmonary rehabilitation program, education; breathing techniques in which subjects had significant improvement in lung function, dyspnea, inspiratory muscle strength, exercise tolerance and quality of life. 3, 9 Besides issue on treatment combination, significant changes in this study outcome also could be attributed by the IMT training prescription. The systemic review by O'Brien et al3 found only 1 out of 5 RCT was conducted for the 4-week duration, whereas, another 4 RCT conducted between 8 to 16-weeks duration which showed significant changes on the study outcomes. However, they employed different type and intensity of IMT using either pressure threshold or targeted resistive IMT with intensity of The Outcomes of Short Term Inspiratory Muscle Training (IMT) Combined with Chest Physiotherapy 30% to 70% of PImax. Furthermore, Geddes et al 25 also in supportive of this finding, in which 16 studies depicted significant improvement following either IMT with targeted resistive or pressure threshold in their systemic reviews. This shows that IMT does give significant changes in study outcomes whether given for short or long term duration with intensity ranging from 30% -70% of PImax.Lung Function In the lung functions summary, the finding in this study shows positive changes. The significant changes 19.4% from baseline after 4-week intervention was also reported by Barakat et al 26 and Cortopassi et al 27 with changes of 16.2% and 2.6%, respectively in FEV1/FVC. The changes in the current study most likely can be due to the absence of co-morbidity among the subjects also may be influenced by the medical treatments.Inspiratory muscle strength As for the inspiratory muscle strength, current finding shows significant improvements 4 weeks after IMT. The recorded inspiratory muscle strength was lower than the previous study which was between 26.2 cmH2O and 38.4 cmH2O (+12.2 cmH2O; 46.6% changes). However, greater changes in percentage from baseline was noted compared to 86 cmH2O to 104.25 cmH2O (+18.25 cmH2O; 21% changes), 64.7 cmH2O to 75.5 cmH2O (p=0.001) (+10.8 cmH2O; 16.6% changes), respectively in the previous study. 18, 27 The significant changes in IG could be influenced by highly motivated subjects, normal body mass index and previous history of physical activity level. 28Exercise tolerance In exercise tolerance summary, this study shows significant improvement in 6MWT distance achieved from 225.6 (±56.4m) to 300.6 (±61.6m) with increase 75 m from baseline distance achieved (33.2% changes). The percentage changes from baseline were higher than 313 (± 72 m) to 392 (± 82 m) with +56 m (21.8% changes); and 256 (± 41 m) to 312 (± 54 m) with +79 m (25.2% changes), respectively, in the previous studies. 16, 29 Although the six minute walking distance in healthy adults has been reported to range from 400 m to 700 m, but an improvement of 54 m has been shown to be clinically important difference. 30 This supports the current findings that an increment of 75 m following IMT was noted although the distance achieved was less than 400 m.Quality of life There was a significant improvement in the total score of Saint George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) that was used as a tool to measure the quality of life (QOL) with reduction from 60 (± 10.6) to 28 (± 5.6) (p = 0.001), and 52.6% changes from baseline. Previous studies also found significant improvement with 18.1 (± 5.1) to 22.4 (± 5.2), (p < .05), 78.7 to 86.6 (p = 0.001), respectively, although they used Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire (CRQ) as a tool to measure QOL. 11, 27 Whereas studies by Garcia et al31 and Fernández et al 29 that have used SGRQ also reported significant improvement with reduction of total score from 58 (±2.2) to 50 (±2.1) (p < 0.05); and 55.3 (± 15.0) to 40.5 (± 13.8) (p = .0001), respectively. In QOL summary, the current and previous study shows significant improvement on QOL although most of the previous study used different study methodology.Conclusions and Limitations This study suggests that combination of IMT with chest physiotherapy treatments for at least 4-week duration can produce benefits for lung function, inspiratory muscle strength, exercise tolerance and quality of life among hospitalized mild to moderate COPD patient. Therefore, the study also would like to recommend either pressure threshold or targeted resistive IMT mode to be used as a part of physiotherapy treatments for treating patients with respiratory conditions especially for COPD. A few limitations of the study were noted. The study was conducted in the military environment in which the study subjects were among the military and exmilitary personnel who has mean age younger than actual non-military COPD patients, history of good physical activity level and body mass index less than 30 . The result may be argued if it is to be generalized outside from the military environment. In addition, medications that prescribed by the physician during hospitalization period could also be the confounding factor in the outcomes. Future study may be conducted to compare IMT intervention alone in order to reveal its benefits thus establish the IMT protocol.presents the outcomes of the intervention after 4 weeks.

To investigate clinical variables such as gestational age, sex, weight, the therapeutic regimens used and mechanical ventilation that might affect morphine requirements and plasma concentrations of morphine and its metabolites. Methods. In a double-blind study, neonates and infants strati®ed for age [group I 0±4 weeks (neonates), group II b4±26 weeks, group III b26±52 weeks, group IV b1±3 yr] admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit after abdominal or thoracic surgery received morphine 100 mg kg ±1 after surgery, and were randomly assigned to either continuous morphine 10 mg kg ±1 h ±1 or intermittent morphine boluses 30 mg kg ±1 every 3 h. Pain was measured using the COMFORT behavioural scale and a visual analogue scale. Additional morphine was administered on guidance of the pain scores. Morphine, morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) and morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) plasma concentrations were measured before, directly after, and at 6, 12 and 24 h after surgery. Results. Multiple regression analysis of different variables revealed that age was the most important factor affecting morphine requirements and plasma morphine concentrations. Signi®cantly fewer neonates required additional morphine doses compared with all other age groups (P<0.001). Method of morphine administration (intermittent vs continuous) had no signi®cant in¯uence on morphine requirements. Neonates had signi®cantly higher plasma concentrations of morphine, M3G and M6G (all P<0.001), and signi®cantly lower M6G/morphine ratio (P<0.03) than the older children. The M6G/M3G ratio was similar in all age groups. Conclusions. Neonates have a narrower therapeutic window for postoperative morphine analgesia than older age groups, with no difference in the safety or effectiveness of intermittent doses compared with continuous infusions in any of these age groups. In infants >1 month of age, analgesia is achieved after morphine infusions ranging from 10.9 to 12.3 mg kg ±1 h ±1 at plasma concentrations of <15 ng ml ±1 .","Morphine is the most frequently used agent for postoperative analgesia in neonates, infants and children. 1±5 Therapeutic plasma concentrations of morphine depend on factors such as route of administration, total body clearance and volume of distribution. These are affected by the age, hepatic function, renal function and clinical condition. 6±9 As a result of these factors, studies of morphine pharmacokinetics report a noticeable variability between patients. 10 While preterm neonates are regarded as a separate group with regard to serum half-life and morphine clearance, the distinction between term newborns and older infants is less clearly de®ned. 10 In addition, the pharmacodynamics of morphine may change rapidly during infancy, being in¯uenced by sex, 11 the maturation of opioid receptors, 12±14 earlier experiences of pain, 15 as well as social and cultural factors. 16 Despite the reported variability, most previous studies have investigated the effects of morphine only in 4±20 patients within the different age groups, 10 thus precluding their ability to examine the effects of underlying clinical and demographic factors. We designed a prospective study including larger numbers of patients in each age group, enabling us to elucidate the impact of various clinical and demographic variables on both morphine requirements and morphine pharmacokinetics. We have recently reported the effects of morphine administration on hormonal and metabolic stress responses following major surgery in the same patient population. 17Methods After approval from the Medical Ethics Committee for the Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, written consent was obtained from all parents. We included 204 children aged 0±3 yr admitted to the paediatric surgical intensive care unit following non-cardiac thoracic and abdominal surgery. Patients were excluded if they had received morphine <6 h before surgery, or suffered from hepatic, renal or neurological disorders. Patients were strati®ed into four age groups: group I 0±4 weeks, group II 4±26 weeks, group III 26±52 weeks, group IV 1±3 yr. They were randomly assigned to receive either i.v. continuous morphine (CM) or intermittent morphine (IM). The pharmacist prepared all study drugs and strata-speci®c schedules for randomization. For each age group, the boxes containing the study drugs were numbered consecutively and used in sequence. Each patient received a study number consisting of a number of the age group (I±IV) and a sequence number (1±68). Anaesthetic management was standardized in all patients. Anaesthesia was induced with i.v. thiopental 3±5 mg kg ±1 or, when i.v. induction was impossible, by inhalation of halothane in oxygen (<5% of patients). After the insertion of an i.v. line, the anaesthetic procedure was similar for all patients. Fentanyl 5 mg kg ±1 was given before orotracheal intubation, which was facilitated with atracurium 0.5±1 mg kg ±1 or succinylcholine 2 mg kg ±1 . Ventilation was controlled and anaesthesia was maintained with iso¯urane 0.5 minimum alveolar concentration in nitrous oxide 60% in oxygen or air in oxygen. Perioperative ¯uids were standardized to maintain a glucose infusion rate of 4±6 mg kg ±1 min ±1 . Body temperature was kept within normal ranges. A peripheral artery was cannulated and the measured mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) data served as preoperative baseline data. Patients received a second dose of fentanyl 5 mg kg ±1 before surgical incision and additional doses of fentanyl 2 mg kg ±1 when HR and/or MAP were 15% above the baseline values. At the end of surgery, the neuromuscular block was antagonized and the tracheal tube removed. Mechanical ventilation was continued in patients who required ventilatory assistance after surgery. The anaesthetist and the surgeon then jointly computed the surgical stress score (SSS). 18 This measure takes into account seven items: amount of blood loss, site of surgery, amount of super®cial trauma, extent of visceral trauma, duration of surgery, associated stress factors (hypothermia, localized or generalized infection, and prematurity) and cardiac surgery. The total scores in this study (excluding cardiac surgery and prematurity <35 weeks) could range from 3 to 24. Directly after surgery, all patients received an i.v. loading dose of morphine hydrochloride 100 mg kg ±1 in 2 min. For children in the CM group this was followed by a morphine infusion 10 mg kg ±1 h ±1 , combined with 3-hourly i.v. placebo (saline) boluses. Children in the IM group received 3-hourly i.v. morphine 30 mg kg ±1 , combined with a continuous placebo infusion (saline). The amount of glucose and the volume of ¯uid was the same in both treatment groups. The clinical staff were blinded to the study group allocation until data collection was complete. The continuous infusion was started within 30 min after the loading dose; the ®rst intermittent bolus (morphine or placebo) was given 3 h after surgery. Pain was assessed by nurses trained in the use of the behavioural part of the COMFORT scale (CS), 19 20 the total score of which can range from 6 to 30, and a 0±10 visual analogue scale (VAS). The modi®ed CS counts six behavioural items: alertness, calmness, respiratory response (for mechanically ventilated children) or crying (for nonventilated children), movement, muscle tone and facial tension. 20 VAS scores were taken after the 2-min observation periods needed for the CS. Additional analgesia was given when there were signs of pain, indicated by VAS score b4. During the ®rst hour after surgery, one-third of the loading dose of morphine could be repeated every 15 min, and thereafter morphine 5 mg kg ±1 every 10 min if required. Nursing interventions included pain assessment, blood sampling and administration of intermittent bolus (placebo or morphine) medication, and then nursing as needed. No other analgesic or sedative drugs were used. Arterial blood samples were taken after induction of anaesthesia (baseline), at the end of surgery, and at 6, 12, and 24 h after surgery for measurement of blood gas values and plasma concentrations of morphine, morphine-3glucuronide (M3G) and morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G). Respiratory depression was de®ned by the presence of apnoea or arterial Pa CO 2 b7.3 kPa in spontaneously breathing patients. 21 Blood samples were taken at time points corresponding with trough plasma morphine concentrations in the IM group.Morphine and metabolite assay The blood samples (1.4 ml) were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min and the serum was stored at ±20°C until analysis. Serum aliquots (0.6 ml) were extracted with the Baker-10 extraction system (Baker Chemicals, Deventer, the Netherlands) ®tted with 1-ml disposable cyclohexyl cartridges (Baker, Chemicals, Deventer, the Netherlands). The extraction column was conditioned with two column volumes methanol, two column volumes water and diammonium sulphate 1 ml 500 mM, pH 9.3. The serum (0.6 ml) was diluted with diammonium sulphate 0.6 ml 500 mM, pH 9.3 before being introduced into the extraction column. It was washed with diammonium sulphate 2 ml 50 mM, pH 9.3, after which it was allowed to dry for 15 s. The elution was carried out with KH 2 PO 4 buffer 0.5 ml 0.01 M, pH 2.1 containing acetonitrile 11%. From this elute 50 ml was injected onto the analytical column. The HPLC system comprised a Spectro¯ow 400 solvent delivery system (Kratos, Rotterdam, the Netherlands) equipped with a degasser (Separations, HI-Ambacht, the Netherlands), a Marathon auto sampler (Separations, HI-Ambacht, the Netherlands), a Spectro¯ow 773 UV detector at l=210 nm (Separations, HI-Ambacht, the Netherlands), in sequence with an ESA electrochemical detector (ESA, Kratos, Rotterdam, the Netherlands) equipped with an analytical cell (Model 5010). All compounds leave the UV detector chemically intact and so the electrochemically active components can be oxidized in the electrochemical cell. This type of electrochemical cell contains two separate analytical cells, which makes it possible to create a small window of applied potential. The detector 2 potential was set at 0.4 V, while the detector 1 potential was 0.3 V. This minimizes interfering peaks because only compounds with an oxidation potential of 0.3±0.4 V are recorded. Chromatographic separations were achieved using a Cp-Sper C8 column (250Q4.6 mm) (Chrompack, Bergen op Zoom, the Netherlands). The mobile phase was KH 2 PO 4 buffer 0.01 M, pH 2.1 containing acetonitrile 11% and heptane sulphonic acid 0.4 g litre ±1 . For the measurement of M3G, M6G and morphine, calibration samples contained all three compounds. In serum, all three calibration graphs (six data points) were linear in the concentration ranges 25±580 ng ml ±1 (r=0.9992) for M3G, 5±100 ng ml ±1 (r=0.9982) for M6G and 5±90 ng ml ±1 (r=0.9963) for morphine. The quanti®cation limit was 5 ng ml ±1 for morphine and M6G and 25 ng ml ±1 for M3G. However, in individual samples, the chromatogram allowed for a lower threshold. As we used median values in this study, these are not affected by the values under the detection limit. In this concentration range, the intra-and inter-day precision was less than 10% for all compounds and the accuracy was about 5% (Table 1 ). 22 23 Standardized automated laboratory analysers were used to measure plasma concentrations of bilirubin and creatinine. Table 1 Intra-day (n=5) and inter-day (n=8) coef®cients of variation (% CV) of spiked morphine and its metabolites in human serum in vitro. Accuracy is the ability to measure the quantity of the compound being determined. Precision: a method is precise if it yields the same results for a series of replicate determinationsCompoundStatistical analysis Relations between age and plasma concentrations of morphine, M3G and M6G were investigated using ANOVA. We applied multiple regression analysis to determine the effects of the gestational age, sex, birth weight, study weight, preoperative and postoperative mechanical ventilation, preoperative plasma concentrations of creatinine and total bilirubin, SSS, location of surgery, morphine treatment and a history of previous surgery, in addition to age on morphine requirements and plasma concentrations of morphine and its metabolites. In all analyses, the morphine and metabolite plasma concentrations were transformed logarithmically in order to approximate normal distribution. Relations between the various factors and the need (yes/no) for extra morphine were assessed by logistic regression analysis. All 204 patients were included in an intention-to-treat analysis. Seven had to be excluded from morphine data analysis (4 in CM, 3 in IM): ®ve had detectable morphine plasma concentrations at baseline as a result of previous morphine administration (congenital diaphragmatic hernia, n=4; meconium peritonitis, n=1), one patient died within 3 h after surgery (vessel loop and therapy-resistant pulmonary hypertension), and another patient required neuromuscular blockade after surgery (hemi-hepatectomy). Logistic and laboratory problems resulted in missing data for several of the 197 included patients. Spearman's rho was used for correlation coef®cients and the other statistical tests used are given in the text. To control the a-error for the multiple statistical tests performed, the level of signi®cance was set at P=0.01, instead of the conventional P=0.05. The power analysis for the comparative randomized trial was given in the original article. 17 In the present paper the effects of age and various other factors are investigated with respect to morphine requirements and plasma concentrations. With a study group of 200 infants, correlations as small as r=0.25 are detectable (a=0.01) with a power greater than 80%.Results Table 2 gives the clinical and surgical characteristics of the 197 enrolled patients, strati®ed by age group and randomized treatment group (97 in the CM group and 100 in the IM group). Patient characteristics and clinical variables within the four age groups were similar in the two randomized groups. Although the surgical procedures varied, the age and treatment groups had similar SSS.Morphine therapy in postoperative infants Overall, there were signi®cant differences in the use of extra morphine between the age groups (P<0.001), but not between the treatment groups. Table 3 shows the need for extra morphine and the total requirement for morphine (excluding the loading dose) in the four age groups. Only 38% of neonates (group I) required additional morphine, a signi®cantly lower percentage than in all older age groups. Signi®cantly more infants aged 4±26 weeks required additional morphine than the children aged 1±3 yr. Multiple logistic regression analysis of all variables showed that age group, plasma concentrations of total bilirubin and the SSS were the most important factors affecting the need for additional morphine. The percentage of patients needing extra morphine was signi®cantly higher in group II than in group I (91% vs 38%, P<0.001). In all age groups, increases in plasma bilirubin concentrations reduced the need for extra morphine (P=0.01) whereas a higher SSS increased the need for extra morphine (P=0.007). During the ®rst hour after the loading dose, the need for additional morphine was only related to age. A signi®cantly higher percentage of patients in group II than in group I (P=0.01) needed extra morphine in this period. There was no consistency in the need for extra morphine during the ®rst hour after surgery and/or between the other time periods (1±6, b6±12, b12±18 and b18±24 h after surgery). Figure 1 shows the percentage of patients needing additional morphine during each of these periods. The age of the child and type of morphine administration signi®cantly affected the morphine dosage (kg ±1 day ±1 ) required. However, inherent to the protocol design, the dosage in the CM group was always 30 mg kg ±1 higher than in the IM group. Disregarding this in the CM group, there was no difference between the groups. Group I needed signi®cantly less morphine than the other age groups (ANOVA, P<0.001) (Table 3 ). Analysis of morphine plasma concentrations 6 h after surgery revealed a signi®cant difference between age groups depending on the type of morphine administration. Therefore, the effect of age groups was evaluated within the treatment groups separately. Plasma concentrations at 12 and 24 h after surgery were no longer dependent on type of treatment. Table 4 gives the plasma concentrations of morphine and its metabolites M3G and M6G, and the differences between age and treatment groups at 6, 12 and 24 h after surgery. Plasma concentrations were signi®cantly higher in group I than in the other groups, and in group II vs group IV (Table 4 ). ANOVA showed that morphine plasma concentrations were signi®cantly affected by the total morphine dose administered (P<0.001). Plasma morphine concentrations in the CM neonatal group (at 12 and 24 h after surgery) were signi®cantly correlated with plasma creatinine concentrations (r=0.5, P=0.01; r=0.4, P=0.04, respectively), and with plasma bilirubin concentrations (both r=0.6, P=0.001). Dif®culties in detection of M3G plasma concentrations in the neonatal group (interfering spikes) resulted in many missing values for M3G in this group (n=32). ANOVA of M3G and M6G plasma concentrations revealed that the age group and the administered dosage of morphine signi®cantly affected these plasma concentrations (both P<0.001). Although plasma concentrations of M3G and M6G were higher after CM than after IM, this difference was only signi®cant for M3G at 6 h after surgery. M3G and M6G plasma concentrations were signi®cantly higher in group I than in the other groups, and in group II vs group IV at 12 and 24 h after surgery (all P<0.001) (Table 4 ). M6G plasma concentrations correlated signi®cantly with plasma creatinine only in the neonates, and only in CM at 12 and 24 h after surgery (r=0.5, P=0.01 and r=0.5, P=0.002, respectively). No such correlation was found for M3G. Figure 2 shows the median plasma concentrations of morphine, M3G and M6G in the four age groups for CM and IM at 6, 12 and 24 h after surgery. Table 5 gives the ratios of morphine and its metabolites at 24 h after surgery, and the signi®cant differences between age groups. The M6G/M ratio showed signi®cant differences between age groups but not between the different treatments. The M6G/M ratio was lower in group I than in all other groups. Neither age nor treatment at any time point had any signi®cant effect on the M6G/M3G ratio (Table 5 ). Eleven spontaneous breathing patients (8 in the IM group, 3 in the CM group) developed postoperative respiratory insuf®ciency; seven of them required intubation (5 in the IM group, 2 in the CM group). Details of age, treatment, surgical procedure, requirement of morphine and complications are given in Table 6 . Table 7 gives an overview of studies reporting requirements and plasma concentrations of morphine after noncardiac surgery, including the present data. 24±26Discussion In this clinical study we investigated (i) the effects of various variables on the morphine dose required in infants, and (ii) the age-related changes in morphine and metabolite concentration. Age was the most important factor differentiating dose requirements between neonates and infants older than 4 weeks. In a recent meta-analysis, a continuous infusion rate of 7 mg kg ±1 h ±1 was calculated for term neonates, assuming a desired steady-state plasma concentration of 15 ng ml ±1 for all ages. 27 Neonates in our current study received higher infusion rates and the concentrations are proportionally similar. Because more than 60% of the neonates had adequate analgesia with the minimal dose of 10 mg kg ±1 h ±1 (median concentration 22 ng ml ±1 ), it is likely that a lower dose of morphine would have suf®ced for the neonates. Signi®cantly more morphine was used in the older children, with requirements ranging from (median) 10.9 to 12.3 mg kg ±1 h ±1 . Even with the additional morphine, the required dose was lower than the recommended dosage of 20 mg kg ±1 h ±1 . 27±31 Remarkably, of the age groups older than 4 weeks, children aged 1±3 yr needed the lowest dosage of morphine (NS). They also had the lowest plasma concentrations of morphine, which suggests that their clearance was the highest. Because concentration is directly proportional to dose, we need to determine clearance in order to predict dose. The wide range of neonatal plasma concentrations reported in the literature was as expected, given the variability in interindividual clearance (Table 7 ). In our study, plasma concentrations of morphine in neonates (n=63) provided adequate analgesia between 15.4 (trough) and 22 ng ml ±1 , and, in infants older than 4 weeks (n=134), between 1.0 and 7.5 ng ml ±1 . These low plasma concentrations of morphine apparently produced effective analgesia, as evidenced by the low postoperative CS and VAS scores. It seems that plasma concentrations as high as 15 ng ml ±1 are not necessary for adequate postoperative analgesia in infants >4 weeks of age. Although at the time of surgery all patients had been without morphine therapy for more than 6 h, plasma morphine was still detectable in ®ve neonates. This indicates that clearance in this age group is low (approxi-Table 4 Plasma concentrations (ng ml ±1 ) of morphine, morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) and morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) at 6, 12 and 24 h after surgery, according to age (group I 0±4 weeks, group II b4±26 weeks, group III b26±52 weeks, group IV b1±3 yr) and treatment group. Data are median (interquartile range). * Age group I higher than all other age groups (CM and IM) (P<0.001); ² Group II higher than IV (CM and IM) (P<0.001); ** CM higher than IM in all age groups (P<0.007); ³ Group I higher than groups III and IV (CM and IM) (P<0.003) (ANOVA) mately 9 ml kg ±1 min ±1 ). 9 Plasma morphine concentrations were signi®cantly dependent on age, bearing in mind that patients with renal impairment were not included. Differences between treatment groups were only found at 6 h after surgery. Extra morphine dosages, given by nurses on the basis of observational pain scores, resulted in similar plasma concentrations in CM and IM from 12 h after surgery. In the CM group, median concentrations decreased from 7.4 to 6.4 to 4.8 ng ml ±1 with increasing age in groups II, III and IV. These data are consistent with an increase in plasma clearance over the age range investigated. Plasma concentrations of morphine that should produce effective analgesia in neonates and older children have been reported to range from 3.8 (SD 2.5) to 125 (9) ng ml ±1 . 26 32±34 This wide range results from the various pain stimuli or sedation end-points, differences in pain perception and pain assessment, and variations in the children's clinical state (severe illness, mechanical ventilation, needing sedation or analgesia, tolerance, etc.). As reported earlier, the relation between morphine requirement and plasma concentrations is also dependent on the type of surgery, which leads to different results after cardiac or non-cardiac surgery. 6 34 Morphine is mainly metabolized in the liver into M3G and M6G by uridine diphosphate glucuronyltransferase (UDG2B7). The kidneys excrete these metabolites, as well as a portion of the unchanged morphine. Developmental maturation, associated with increasing renal clearance and decreasing drug half-life, starts in the early neonatal period and goes on for 2 yr. Using the three-quarters power model, adult levels of clearance were reached at an earlier age (2±6 months). 35 High morphine plasma concentrations and low M3G/M and M6G/M ratios, as were found in the neonates, might indicate a low glucuronidation capability. However, from 12 h after surgery, the highest plasma concentrations of M3G and M6G were found in the neonates, showing that they were able to glucuronidate morphine. Nevertheless, hepatic induction of these enzyme systems cannot be ruled out. The high plasma concentrations of morphine metabolites in the neonates were the result of low renal clearance, which was con®rmed by the signi®cant correlation between serum creatinine and M6G in this age group. The decreased clearance of morphine explains its increased analgesic effect in neonates, contributed to by the active metabolite M6G. While the M3G/M and M6G/M ratios increased with age, indicating improved morphine metabolism, the M3G and M6G plasma concentrations decreased with age, indicating improved renal excretion, as reported in other studies as well. 7 34 36 37 In the present study, plasma concentrations of morphine and morphine metabolites were not only signi®cantly different between neonates (group I) and the older children (groups II, III and IV), but also between infants aged 4±26 weeks (group II, median age 3 months) and 1±3 yr (group IV, median age 20 months). The major changes in morphine metabolism and elimination apparently take place in the ®rst 3 months after birth, and only minor differences in morphine clearance are found after that age. The development of the glucuronidation capability and the renal function might have resulted in lower plasma concentrations of morphine in the older children. Clinical effects, however, may be more dependent on the concentrations in brain tissue, receptor characteristics 14 and other factors. Reported correlations between metabolite/morphine ratios and gestational age or birth weight are controversial. M3G/M and M6G/M ratios increased with increasing birth weight 37 38 and gestational age 38 (glucuronidation capability increases), which was not found by Barrett and colleagues. 39 The disparity in plasma morphine glucuronide ratios between the different studies could be a result of the varying number of patients in the individual studies, differences in gestational age and study age, in detection limits of metabolites, and in the duration of morphine infusions and the time of sampling. Because M3G and M6G have long half-lives in neonates 39 (impaired renal function), it is suggestive that in neonates the M6G/M and M3G/M ratios are increasing with increased periods of morphine infusion. In a review examining the effects of age, renal impairment and route of administration on morphine metabolism, Faura and colleagues 7 reported a consistently high correlation between M6G and M3G, with a ratio of about 15% in neonates and children, as in adults. Across all studies, the range of the ratios of metabolites to morphine was wide. However, there was almost complete overlap between children (>1 month) and adults, but neonates (<1 month) had discernibly lower ratios for both metabolites. Although In the present study, neonates differed signi®cantly from the older children in median M6G/M ratio (P=0.003) but there were no signi®cant differences between the three older age groups. The M6G/M3G ratio at 24 h after i.v. morphine was not signi®cantly different between the four age groups (0±3 yr). Although the data are dif®cult to compare (median vs mean weighted values 7 ), both studies result in similar conclusions: (i) neonates differ signi®cantly from older patients (children and adults, respectively), having an immature morphine metabolism; (ii) children older than 4 weeks metabolize morphine like older children, as presented in our study, and like adults; 7 and (iii) the M6G/M3G ratio remains constant at all ages. Hartley and colleagues 37 reported decreasing M6G/M3G plasma ratios, although not signi®cantly, with increasing birth weight. This might suggest a differential development of enzymes (UGT2B7) for the formation of M3G and M6G. Recently, it was shown that UGT2B7 is responsible for the glucuronidation of morphine and is capable of catalysing the glucuronidation of both the 3-and 6-hydroxyl moieties on these molecules. 40 41 However, polymorphism in the coding sequence, as well as in the 5¢-¯anking region, may affect the rate of morphine glucuronidation and can result in individual differences. 42 The SSS was developed as a measure of the severity of surgical stress. 18 Although in the present study the scores did not differ signi®cantly between age or treatment groups, multiple regression analysis showed that they signi®cantly in¯uenced the dosage of morphine required. In the absence of other methods that can directly measure postoperative pain across different age groups, the SSS may help to assess the need for postoperative morphine. Eight of the 11 children who showed respiratory insuf-®ciency were in the IM treatment group. In most of these patients respiratory depression could not be attributed to the morphine therapy but had to be considered as a complication of their surgical operation. In conclusion, age is the most important factor in morphine requirement and morphine metabolism. In our previous study investigating the effect of CM and IM on surgical stress responses in the same patient population, infants aged 1±3 yr in the IM group showed greater stress than those in the CM group. 17 Combining the results of both studies, we conclude that morphine given intermittently does not provide any clinical advantages and that a continuous morphine infusion is probably safer in neonates and more effective in older infants. By stratifying for age and carefully monitoring the children's behaviour, we were able to give more precise dosages for postoperative morphine after major non-cardiac surgery. We agree with the recommended dosage for continuous morphine infusions of 7 mg kg ±1 h ±1 in full-term neonates. 27 However, we would advise starting with an infusion rate of 10 mg kg ±1 h ±1 in infants >4 weeks of age. Differences in developmental maturation between neonates and infants indicate the need for individual drug dosages. Increase of the infusion rates should only be based on pain scoring by trained nurses, in order to prevent overdosing.Fig 2 ( 2 Fig 2 (A) Morphine, (B) morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) and (C) morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) plasma concentrations (median) in the four age groups (I 0±4 weeks, II b4±26 weeks, III b26±52 weeks, IV b1±3 yr) at 6, 12 and 24 h after surgery.

Morphine sulfate is generally considered the drug of choice. Expected toxicities include a 30-70% incidence of nausea and/or vomiting [3, 4] , a 10-80% incidence of itching [3] [4] [5] , and rarer cases of urinary retention [2, 4] . Respiratory depression is serious although unusual [2] . While the spectrum of anticipated toxicities is similar, anecdotal reports indicate a lower incidence of side effects with hydromorphone when compared with morphine [6] . We performed a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial comparing the toxicity of morphine with that of equianalgesic doses of hydromorphone used for PCA in children. A sample of 96 healthy children (aged 8-21 years) hospitalized after surgery was randomized to receive either morphine or hydromorphone PCA. A morphine : hydromorphone potency ratio of 1:5 was assumed, and the opioids were administered as an 0.015 mg/kg morphine equivalents demand dose (0.015 mg of morphine or 0.003 mg of hydromorphone), with an 8-minute lock out interval and a 0.375 mg/kg morphine equivalents 4-hour maximum dose. Opioid use, pain, respiratory depression (hypopnea and/or hypercapnea sufficient to warrant intervention), nausea, emesis, itching, and urinary retention were recorded every 8 hours and treated as needed. PCA use continued until pain declined sufficiently to allow transition to oral analgesics, or toxicity of sufficient severity to discontinue the study was encountered. Pain assessments were performed every 4 hours while the patient was awake. Patient demographic characteristics, hours of PCA exposure, total opioid dose, and highest pain scores were summarized with descriptive statistics and compared with independent samples t-tests or chi-square tests. Toxicities of the two treatments were compared by computing the frequency of each toxicity within each treatment group. Ninety-six patients were evaluated; 11 of those (three morphine, eight hydromorphone) were withdrawn before completion of the study for unacceptable opioid side effects, leaving 85 patients for complete analysis. There was no difference between treatment groups in demographic characteristics, the presence of a urinary catheter, opioid use, pain scores, treated side effects, or the presence of an oxygen requirement (Table 1 ). No patient developed clinically significant bradycardia or hypotension during the treatment period. Overall, 74% reported nausea, 43% emesis (maximum in first 24 hours), 50% itching (maximum at 48 hours), and 8% urinary retention.

No author or family member has had any financial relationship with a cumulative value of $10,000 or more per year in the last 3 years, with any company or entity whose products may be related to the topic of this manuscript. All authors were at this address at the time of the study. Most patients unable to complete the study (73%) had received hydromorphone (P = 0.17). All five patients withdrawn for respiratory depression had received potentially sedative drugs either during the recent anesthetic [4] or diphenhydramine administered to treat pruritus [1] . When two patients were withdrawn from the study at a time of day when pharmacy staff were not available to provide information as to treatment group, patients were ""changed"" to hydromorphone even though they had been assigned to the hydromorphone group. Although many [6, 7] believe that hydromorphone has a more favorable side-effect profile, delivery of equianalgesic doses of morphine or hydromorphone by PCA results in the same side effects in children and adolescents with postoperative pain. In our practice, the opinion that morphine is more likely to cause side effects is shown by the fact that in the absence of information as to the drug's identity, uncomfortable patients were ""changed"" to hydromorphone PCA even though they were already receiving it. The children in our study used amounts of opioid similar to those in other studies, achieved comparable pain control [2, 3, 8] , and had nausea [3] and itching [3] well within reported ranges. The time course of side effects, with nausea and vomiting developing early and itching more slowly, can be useful in assessment of the reasons for the variation in incidence of these side effects between studies. Hydromorphone provides an acceptable alternative to morphine PCA but does not have a more favorable overall side-effect profile in children with postoperative pain. While there are no population-based differences between the drugs, interindividual differences do exist. The choice for any single patient depends primarily on their history; perhaps, genetic testing will be able to decrease the trial and error associated with this method of selection. Coadministration of potentially sedative drugs should intensify monitoring for respiratory depression.

Research indicates that when provided to girls in resource poor settings, cash transfers can increase education and postpone marriage and pregnancy. However, a few studies indicate that they can also have negative effects which can affect their acceptability, such as generating intra-community tensions. Objective: Conceptually informed by Rogers' diffusion of innovation theory, this paper explores factors affecting the acceptability of economic support in a randomized controlled trial in rural Monze and Pemba Districts of Southern Province in Zambia. Methods: Qualitative data were collected through five focus group discussions and six indepth, semi-structured interviews and analysed using thematic analysis. This study was done in the combined arm of a trial where girls received both economic support and participated in youth clubs offering sexuality and life-skills education. Results: In the study communities, acceptability was encouraging by the belief that economic support provided benefits beyond beneficiaries and that it improved access to education, and reduced teen pregnancies, marriages and school drop-out. However, provision of economic support only to selected girls and their parents and fear among some that the support was linked to satanic practices negatively affected acceptability. These fears were mitigated through community sensitisations. Conclusion: The study demonstrated that relative advantage, observability, simplicity and compatibility were key factors in influencing acceptability of the economic support. However, to enhance acceptability of cash transfer schemes aimed at addressing early marriage and pregnancy, it is important to explore socio-cultural factors that create suspicions and negative perceptions and to provide schemes that are perceived as relatively better than available similar schemes, understood, compatible and viable beyond the immediate beneficiary.","Background Despite effects on health and the risk of perpetuating poverty among adolescents, teenage pregnancy continues to be common in many low and middleincome countries (LMICs). This is a public health challenge because girls under the age of 18 may not be mature or emotionally developed enough to have a healthy pregnancy or to give birth [1] . Each year in LMICs, 2.5 million females aged under 16 and 16 million females aged between 15 and 19 give birth and 3.9 million have abortions [1] . In Zambia, 28.5% of girls aged 15-19 years have been pregnant [2] . The rates are higher in rural areas, where 37% report ever being pregnant compared with 20% in urban areas. Those out of school and in the lowest wealth quintiles are more likely to become pregnant than those in school and in the highest quintiles [3] . This suggests that being poor and living in rural areas exposes adolescents to factors and processes that predispose them to early pregnancies. Previous research indicates that adolescent pregnancy in Zambia is often intertwined with and driven by various social, economic and sexual-relations patterns that are further influenced by other underlying issues such as gender dynamics where women and girls are regarded as the weaker sex [4] . Girls often have little choice regarding whether and when to get pregnant and married which undermines their human rights and compromises their opportunity to fully realize their socioeconomic development potential. Social cash transfer (CT) programmes have shown positive results on adolescent educational attainment and a range of other dimensions, including health, child protection and safe transitions to adulthood in many LMICs [5, 6] . They have been used as social safety schemes that provide vulnerable individuals with regular cash payment to lessen deprivation and improve their general well-being as well as improve other aspects of their lives. Social cash transfers are even more vital in LMICs' fragile settings where shocks occur more frequently and vulnerable households are hit hardest, forcing them to face shortfalls that restrict their capacities to cater for their family needs. Regular transfers tend to alleviate these constraints. CTs in LMICs, like Sub-Sahara Africa (SSA), are specifically configured to respond both to the general needs, such as improving human capital, improving reproductive health outcomes, including STI prevention and forced or early marriage, and the specific needs facing the region, such as food security and survival [7] . In Malawi, Baird and colleagues found that payment of school fees combined with a small cash transfer to adolescent girls and their families resulted in reduced pregnancy rates among girls enrolled in school and led to lower prevalence of HIV and Herpes simplex virus type 2 [5] . The diverse cultural settings in LMICs also play a key role in shaping their delivery and impact that CTs achieve. A study by Dako-Gyeke et al. [8] in Ghana found that although CTs were initially meant for targeted vulnerable children, the transfers were being spent on all the children in the household. This was due to Ghanaian culture whereby all children eat from the same pot and thus those selected as direct beneficiaries shared with other children in the household. CTs have been applied in developed and developing countries and in 2013 nearly 1 billion people were covered by this type of protection [9] . In Zambia, the government has piloted different social cash transfer schemes aimed at cushioning deprivation among selected vulnerable groups since the first Child Grant Program in 2010 [10] . One such scheme is the Keeping Girls in School (KGS) which aims to increase girls' access to secondary education through payment of school fees and rentals for weekly boarding for eligible girls [11] . The initiative, implemented by the Ministry of General Education, targets 14,000 Secondary School girls (Grades 8-12) from households that have been selected for the government's social cash transfer schemes for vulnerable families across the country. Studies on factors that shape the acceptability of social cash transfer schemes aimed at addressing early pregnancy and marriage are very scarce. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the only related studies were done by Skovdal et al. [12] and Pavanello et al. [13] . Skovdal et al. examined the acceptability and perceived impact of a communityled cash transfer programme in Zimbabwe. They found that community participation, combined with the perceived impact of the cash transfer programme on children's health and education, led community members to speak enthusiastically about the programme [12] . Pavanello et al. reviewed SCT programmes in Africa and Middle East and found that although cash transfers have positive effects on community bonding, they can also have negative effects, particularly in fuelling intracommunity tensions and generating feelings of unfairness, which might lead communities to shun social cash transfer schemes [13] . The current study was done within the Research Initiative to Support the Empowerment of girls (RISE), a cluster randomised controlled trial in Zambia examining the effectiveness of economic support for adolescent girls and their families, alone or in combination with community dialogue meetings, and youth clubs providing sexuality and life-skills education [14] . Prior to the trial, a pilot study was conducted to test the feasibility and acceptability of the different intervention components. It indicated that some communities had reservations over being given free economic support by people they considered strangers, indicating issues related to the acceptability of the intervention [15] . Due to these experiences, the current study aimed to explore more deeply factors influencing acceptability of the economic support in RISE trial in order to contribute to formulation of locally acceptable cash transfer schemes aimed at addressing early pregnancy and marriage in Zambia and elsewhere.Theoretical framework Various theories explain the process of adoption of interventions. The Diffusion of Innovations Theory, developed by [16] is one of the common frameworks for examining the adoption and development of new ideas and new technology and one of the most widely used theories in understanding adoption of innovations [17] . It was therefore chosen as the theoretical framework to examine the acceptability of the economic support in RISE. In its basic form, diffusion is defined as the process through which an innovation is adopted and gains acceptance from individuals or members of a community [18] . Rogers' Diffusion theory was initially developed to study how new technology and other interventions are diffusedhow, why and at what rate they spread. In this case, however, there is no diffusion, but we apply the concepts to study process of acceptability and adoption. Drawing from the theory of diffusion, an innovation is more likely to be accepted by the adopting system and thus, would be scalable if it has attributes of 1) Relative advantage, which is the degree to which an innovation is perceived as being better than the idea that it supersedes or existing similar programmes; 2) Compatibility or the degree to which an innovation is perceived as consistent with existing values, past experiences and needs of potential adopters; 3) Complexity, which is the degree to which an innovation is perceived to be difficult to understand and implement or access; 4) Trialability pertains to how easy an innovation can be tried on an experimental basis, and finally, 5) Observability is about the degree to which the results of the innovation are visible or viable to others. These elements can help identify factors that could determine whether a target audience may accept economic support to adolescent girls or not.Methods The RISE trial was conducted in 12 districts of Zambia and measured the effects of economic support and community dialogue on adolescent childbearing, early marriage and education [14, 19] . RISE has three study arms and recruited approximately 4900 girls enrolled in grade 7 in 157 schools in 2016. We recruited girls in grade 7 as they were about to reach the transition between primary and secondary school when the risk of not continuing in school is high (because of school fees, distances, academic requirements at secondary level) and the risk of getting married and pregnant is high. In the first intervention arm, participating girls were given monthly cash transfers (ZMW30 or about USD 3), while their parents were offered an annual grant (ZMW350 or about 35 USD). A teacher was appointed at each intervention school to manage the distribution of the transfers. In addition, girls' school fees were covered for girls who enrolled in grades 8 and 9 (junior secondary school) in 2017 and 2018. In the second intervention arm, the same economic support was combined with community meetings and youth clubs for girls and boys to provide education on sexual and reproductive health and lifeskills. The third arm was the control arm where none of the above was offered. These interventions were provided from September 2016 up to the end of November 2018, and the girls will be followed up until the end of 2020.Study design This exploratory qualitative study used semistructured focus group discussions and interviews that allowed us to explore factors influencing acceptability of the economic support in RISE. It was important to allow participants to use their own words to describe their experiences, therefore, we chose to use group discussions and individual interviews. This also gave us the flexibility to explore a subject deeper with the participants. In the focus group, the respondents could also state their agreement or disagreement with the responses and statements of other participants. This elicited the dynamic of interaction of participants debating with one another about different sides of an issue.Study location, study participants and sampling Data were collected from five rural schools and surrounding communities in Monze and Pemba Districts of Southern Province in Zambia. These schools were in the arm receiving both the economic support and community meetings and youth club interventions. Purposive sampling, defined by Cohen et al. (2000) as sampling for a specific purpose and picking a group who fit a profile, was used to select the study participants. To gather a broad range of perspectives, community members with varying degrees of involvement were invited to participate in the study. Pupils were chosen from class registers and community members were chosen with the help of the RISE project team. This paper reports on the perspectives of 24 adults and 16 youths aged around 15. In total, six persons participated in individual interviews and 40 in focus group discussions involving five focus groups: one for non-beneficiary boys in the same class with beneficiary girls, one mixed group of beneficiary girls and non-beneficiary boys in same class, one for beneficiary parents, one for parents of non-beneficiary boys from same class as beneficiary girls and one for beneficiary girls. Individual interviews participants included community gate keeperstwo village headmen, two teachers, one PTA Chair and one community member. In total, there were 46 participants, out of which 33 were beneficiaries of economic support and the remaining 13 were non-beneficiaries.Data collection and analysis Interviews were conducted in November 2017, about 14 months into the trial. Excepting one that was carried out in English, all interviews were conducted in the local language, Tonga, by the first author. The interview guides were pre-tested to verify their usefulness. The interview guide explored the perspectives of the respondents on the following topics: how the programme was perceived to impact on local cultures and norms, benefits of CT on the target audience and communities and local barriers to programme success. The individual interviews lasted an average of 40 min, while group interviews took about 60 min. The interviews were translated and transcribed into English and coded using NVivo (Table 1 ). Data coding involved reading field notes taken during and after each interview, coding, sorting and synthesising transcripts into themes aligned to Rogers' five perceived attributes (see Table 1 ). We used priori coding and thematic network analysis. The priori coding approach was selected because we started with a pre-existing theory derived from Roger's perceived attributes theory as framework for understanding factors affecting the acceptability of the RISE economic support.Ethics Ethical approval was granted by the University of Zambia Biomedical Research Ethics Committee (UNZABREC; REF. NO. 066-06-17). Informed and written consent was obtained from all participants. We used pseudonyms throughout the report. The audio recordings were stored on a password-secured computer. Recording and transcription was done by the first author and only he had access to the recordings.Results We identified several factors that influenced the acceptability of the economic support in the RISE Trial. The findings have been grouped around four of Roger's five attributes: Relative advantage, Compatibility, Observability and Complexity. Interview results indicated that trialability was not a factor in accepting or rejecting the RISE economic support, so this was excluded from the findings.Relative advantageWide benefits through freedom in how to use the money The economic support was generally accepted by most respondents because of its perceived wide benefits beyond the primary girl to include other members of the family. In contrast with other social cash transfer programmes, like the World Vision bicycle scheme, it could be used for school requirements of other family members without disturbing the needs of the beneficiary girl. This sentiment was echoed by both beneficiary and non-beneficiary respondents. ""Apart from looking at school requirements for a RISE beneficiary, we allocated the money among the children that we have. So, the little that we got benefitted everyone in the family"" (FGD 003, Beneficiary Female Parent, respondent 5). The bulk payment of school fees for beneficiary girls was believed to benefit the whole community by providing the school with enough funds to improve school infrastructure, like desks. Schools would usually have less money available for infrastructure because many parents struggled to pay the full school fees. ""The school benefits because once they pay school fees, the school is able to buy things needed to run the school like desks and school books"" (FG004, respondent 1non-beneficiary boy). The beneficiary girls liked the cash transfer because they could use it as pocket money to buy food at school, shoes, soap and lotion while others also invested in rearing chickens and goats for income sources.CompatibilityNeeds and key financial challenges addressed Most respondents perceived the economic support to have been directly focused on needs and key financial challenges that they faced concerning accessing education and failure to pay school fees and provide other materials. It was perceived to be in-tune with their poverty realities and this influenced its acceptability. ""Absenteeism is brought about because of our poverty. Some children are not able to pay school fees and are not in school. When that package came it enabled parents buy uniforms and other school requirements and send their children to school"" (Senior Teacher: ID001).Comparability with key community values and interest Economic support was generally believed to be consistent with the target population's values and, in some cases, was believed to mould good values in girls. They believed that it also promoted good behaviour, such as abstaining from sexual relations, among girls because it empowered them to focus on their studies instead of looking for money from men. As most respondents were Christians, this was an important aspect that influenced the acceptability of the RISE support. It was perceived as an 'upright' project that came in peace. ""RISE came in peace, it never stopped anyone going to church or encourage to do bad things, it is just here to protect girls to keep themselves so that they can learn and be able to have good futures like being a nurse which you can't if you don't get an education (Boy non-beneficiary participant 4, FGD004). On the negative side, some respondents felt that because the economic support only catered for a small number of girls in grade 7 and their families, it was not compatible with the larger community's needs and expectations. ""Those with boys complain that their children are also poor, so why were they left out?"" (Female Parent Beneficiary Participant 5, FGD001). Some beneficiary youths felt the project was making their non-beneficiary friends look for money from men so that they also could buy personal items like them. According to them, CTs may have contributed to other girls feeling jealous and taking more risks to get cash. ""They look for men to give them money in exchange for sex so that they also have money like us. This is the bad side I have seen"" (Beneficiary girl, respondent 1, FGD005). Some respondents feared that the girls would start engaging in transactional sex after closure of the project because they were used to receiving money. There were also some salient community contextual factors that affected acceptability. One such factor was the fear of Satanism, which was described by some respondents as being associated with the apocalyptic prophesies being taught in some churches. A story was spread that anyone who accepted the free cash would join Satanism. This caused stress and stigma for those receiving the support during those initial phases. Because of this, it was reported that in some communities, a few recipients had returned the money after receiving it. However, the majority of girls and parents were reassured through the community meetings that were held prior to the start of the intervention period. ""When it started there were some difficulties, there was backbiting and pointing fingers at each other from some community members about joining Satanism, especially from our friends who were not on RISE"" (Beneficiary Female parent 6, FGD002).ObservabilityIncreased school attendance Many girls receiving the support were reportedly attending school more regularly compared to the previous years. This increase was attributed to the economic support and to some extent the encouragement received from youth clubs and community meetings. With good uniforms, books and monthly CTs, girls were motivated to focus on school. Respondents believed that school drop-out due to poverty was reduced and this influenced the acceptability of the economic support. ""Here the poverty that we have makes it possible for children to drop out of school. Now because of RISE money, all children in this class are in school, no one has dropped because there is help, so we are happy about that"" (male beneficiary parent, respondent ID002).Reduced teen pregnancies and marriages incidences Most respondents believed that the economic support was accepted because of its perceived influence on reducing teen pregnancies and early marriages. It was believed that before RISE, the number of pregnancies and marriages for the same grades were higher. Most respondents believed that girls were now spending more time on school and homework, thereby reducing exposure to the risks of unintended pregnancies. ""So, from my own observation, I have noticed that, at least these girls who are in grade 8 (beneficiaries), teen pregnancies are reducing. It's not like what we see in other schools where there is no RISE"" (Senior citizen male beneficiary respondent IDOO2). They also believed that the economic support had reduced child marriages and elopements. Elopements, which refers to young people running off secretly to be married, were believed to happen when a girl and a boy decided to get married due to lack of financial support to go to school. It was reported that when elopement happened before RISE, parents would let the girl get married and stop school due to poverty. They felt that even if they retrieved her, she would still not complete school. In some instances, this would be an opportunity for some parents to raise money through bride prices. Marriage negotiations could also be initiated to save the honour of the girl and her family. ""If a child receiving support from RISE has been eloped, the parents will follow her and bring her back to school. No one has been followed before RISE support"" (Beneficiary parent, female respondent 1, FGD003). ""Because once there is no money, parents would just think of marrying off the girl so that they get bride price. But now with RISE CT we cannot think of that because the money is there for school"" (village headman ID003).Complexity The interviews indicated that one of the factors influencing the acceptability of economic support in RISE was that its purpose was understood and easy to access. Intensive community education, which was being done through youth clubs and community meetings, was credited as one of the avenues for creating awareness about the purpose of the economic support among the target communities. The cash was accessed every month by the beneficiaries and no hitch was reported to that effect. ""There is no problem … A teacher goes to get the money from town each month to give the girls, which is very good. The information that you have given us about the purpose of RISE CT for me is enough because you have touched in all angles (Village headman, ID004). The school fees were paid directly to the school and community meetings were conducted at the school and open to everyone. Limited effort was required to access these components and they were also easily understood.Discussion Informed by the conceptual framework provided by Rogers' theory about the diffusion of innovations, this study explored factors affecting the acceptability of the economic support in RISE. It investigated whether attributes of the economic support and other contextual factors influenced target audiences' acceptance or rejection of the economic support. Results suggest that although there were reservations in some target communities during the initial phase of the trial, there was generally a wide acceptance of the economic support. We found that only four of Rogers' five attributes influenced the acceptability of the economic support: relative advantage, observability, compatibility and complexity. Relative advantage of the economic support was conceptualised in terms of wide benefits beyond primary beneficiaries, compared to other cash transfer schemes in the target communities. This is consistent with previous studies suggesting that if potential users see no advantage in using the innovation, they will not adopt it [20] . In other words, for new cash transfer schemes to be adopted they must have a clear advantage over existing interventions or no intervention at all. Our findings indicate that this was what most respondents, both beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries, felt about the economic support in RISE. The economic support was regarded as enough for its intended purposes as almost all respondents spoke enthusiastically about how helpful the support was. Considering that these were poor peasant households with frequent budget deficits, small as it may appear, the support made a substantial contribution to their needs and this influenced the acceptability. Observability was another element that influenced acceptability. When the interviews were conducted, the effectiveness of the interventions on childbearing had not yet been measured, but the respondents believed that the economic support had reduced teen pregnancies, marriages and increased school attendance for the girls. They suggested that the economic support had empowered girls by reducing their economic dependence on men, thereby reducing their sexual activities which could expose them to pregnancies and marriages. This probably reflects that the rate of adoption is greater when there is high visibility of successful use of an innovation [21] . Compatibility, measuring the degree of congruence between an innovation, the target and the setting in which the innovation will be used, was another factor that influenced the acceptability of the economic support. Findings suggest that the support was integrated or at least coexisted well with values, experiences and needs of the target audiences. According to [22] , compatibility includes the extent to which the innovation is consistent with what people do or what they have been doing or how they live their lives. The respondents expressed that the economic support was consistent with target audiences' way of life. For instance, the economic support did not require them to change their values, norms, cultures or day-to-day behaviours. This finding is in line with studies which state that compatibility is an important recurrent feature in innovation acceptance studies [22] . Traditions and social norms that indicated the 'right and appropriate behaviour' according to the target audience threatened this compatibility [23] . According to Scott et al., anything that is new and perceived not to support traditional patterns can be regarded as threatening [23] . During the pilot and initial phase of the RISE trial, some community members connected the economic support to Satanism which created a sense of fear and affected their acceptability of the trial (Joseph M Mumba et al., 2018). To reduce the fears, a series of community sensitisation activities were used and appeared to be effective in combatting the rumours. The element of simplicity of the economic support also contributed to levels of acceptance. Most respondents were informed about the purpose of the economic support during community sensitisations and youth club meetings and the information they received helped them seek clarification that facilitated acceptance of the economic support. This was not surprising considering that SCTs are generally considered easy to implement and simple to understand [24] . Initial community sensitizations were credited as making the community aware of the purpose of the economic support and helping facilitate the adoption process. This is in line with findings from [25] who found that community education is central to the communities' acceptability of SCT schemes and can have secondary impacts on measurable outcomes. This also corresponds to Rogers' (1995) 'knowledge stage' of the adoption process. He defines it as 'the mental process through which an individual pass from first hearing about an innovation to final adoption' [26] . All the respondents who took part in the focus group discussions and interviews were from schools where the economic support was combined with youth clubs and community meetings. We did not conduct any interviews or discussions in schools which only received the economic support. Thus, our findings may have been somewhat influenced by the interactions between potential users and the communities where they exchanged information about the RISE economic support. However, judging from the proportion of participants who collected the cash transfers and from the feedback shared by the RISE cash teachers, the acceptability was also high in schools that did not have youth club meetings and regular community meetings. It is possible that the initial community sensitization meetings were sufficient to achieve acceptance of the economic support as they brought potential adopters together with chiefs, teachers and headmen who are known to play an important role in convincing others to adopt an innovation [27] especially in a rural settings of Zambia where they yield substantial influence. While the research and practice paradigm known as the diffusion theory offers a set of concepts that can be used to explain acceptability of innovations by individuals, not all these concepts are relevant in the acceptability of SCT support. The findings indicated that trialability did not play much of a role in influencing users to accept or reject the economic support. The only issue which came out is that, after using the money and realising that no one was being initiated or converted into satanism as they thought, most community members ended up perceiving the economic support positively. However, this may not be true in all settings as the diverse cultural contexts in LMICs also play a key role in shaping their delivery and impact that CTs achieve. One main limitation of the study was the perception from the community that the researcher was part of the implementation team. This may have made the respondents appear to be more positive about the support than they actually were. To mitigate this perception, the researcher continuously reminded the study participants that he was an independent postgraduate student researcher. As part of establishing rapport, the study participants were also shown the letter from the ethics committee at the beginning of each interview which confirmed that the researcher was conducting this study as part of his postgraduate study.Conclusion The findings of this study indicated that the innovation adoption process is multifaceted and dynamic. Contextual factors and attributes of the innovation played an important role in its acceptability. More specifically the study suggests that for future social cash transfer innovations addressing early marriage and pregnancy to be accepted, they need to demonstrate that they are relatively advantageous, simple to understand and access, compatible and viable beyond the immediate beneficiary. Additionally, results indicated that the innovation adoption process depends on communication, and community sensitization may facilitate that process. These findings may be useful for cash transfer planners in modelling acceptability of other social cash transfer schemes.

However, some of these concepts are not relevant in some SCT support acceptance settings. By identifying the parameters of Rogers' perceived attributes in SCT support acceptability processes, finding from this study can help understand factors that lead to the failure of SCT schemes and why these factors occur. The study can also help in successful dissemination and implementation of community-based implementation systems.Table 1 . 1 Global theme: factors affecting acceptability of RISE economic support.

This study uses mixed methods to explore access to disability-targeted and non-targeted social protection programmes in Nepal, particularly the District of Tanahun. In total, 31% of people with disabilities had Disability Identification Cards, which entitles them to a range of different social protection benefits depending on the card level, including disability-targeted social assistance (received by 13% of people with disabilities). Overall, 37% of people with disabilities received social assistance, which was higher than for people without disabilities (21%). The most commonly accessed form of social assistance was the Old Age Allowance, which had universally high coverage amongst both people with and without disabilities. Uptake of disability-targeted social protection entitlements other than social assistance (e.g. scholarships, discounted transportation and health services) was generally low. Factors impacting upon access included the geographic and financial accessibility of the application process, procedures for determining eligibility and compliance of service providers.","Introduction Social protection systems are an integral component to most governments' strategies for poverty reduction, as well as broader social and economic development (World Bank 2012) . Although conceptualisations vary, social protection may be defined as ""public actions taken in response to levels of vulnerability, risk, and deprivation which are deemed socially unacceptable within a given polity or society"" (Conway et al. 2000) . Aims of social protection similarly differ, with some focussing narrowly on protecting minimum living standards, while more ""transformational"" approaches view social protection as a tool to develop stronger livelihoods, tackle chronic poverty and address social inequalities (Merrien 2013) . Almost all countries, including low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), have put in place some social protection initiatives, with many continuing to focus on expanding their content and coverage, as well as improving their impact (International Labour Organization 2017). There are variety of instruments that may fall under the banner of social protection (Gentilini and Omamo 2011) . Core components of social protection are social assistance and social insurance (Barrientos 2018) . Social assistance refers to non-contributory transfers of cash or kind to groups deemed vulnerable to or currently in poverty (e.g. conditional/unconditional cash transfers, food assistance). Social insurance programmes in turn are typically contributory, and are designed to mitigate risks that may be encountered throughout the life-course (e.g. illness and injury, unemployment, loss of income in old age, natural disasters). Under broader definitions of social protection, labour market regulations (e.g. minimum wage, non-discrimination legislation) or interventions to promote equitable access to services and enjoyment of basic rights may be considered as social protection (Gentilini and Omamo 2011; Devereux and Sabates-Wheeler 2004) . In LMICs, however, social assistance has been the main pillar of social protection (Barrientos 2011) . Developing and strengthening social protection systems is a core aim of the International Labour Organization's Social Protection Floors Recommendation (2012) and the 2015-2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (United Nations 2017); For example, SDG Target 1.2 highlights social protection as a key input to ""end poverty in all its forms"", while other SDGs and their targets specify social protection as central for achieving a range of goals, such as universal health coverage, gender equality, reducing inequality and decent work for all (International Labour Organization 2017). While acknowledging that all citizens should be provided with certain nationally appropriate guarantees-such as income security and access to essential services-it is acknowledged that social protection is particularly important for groups and individuals at a higher risk of poverty and facing other forms of marginalisation (Gentilini and Omamo 2011; Devereux and Sabates-Wheeler 2004) . People with disabilities-who account for upwards of 15% of the global population-are often considered as key beneficiaries in national and international social protection strategies (Yeo 2001; Elwan 1999; World Health Organization & World Bank 2011) . Disability is defined in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD) as including people ""who have long-term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairments which in interaction with various barriers may hinder their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others"" (United Nations Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights 2006). People with disabilities may be targeted for inclusion in social protection due to high levels of economic and multidimensional poverty, as well as frequent social exclusion and marginalisation (United Nations 2015; Gentilini and Omamo 2011; Holzmann and Jørgensen 2001) . For example, in a recent systematic review of 150 studies in LMICs, 81% found that people with disabilities were economically poorer compared with people without disabilities (Banks et al. 2017) . Similarly, other studies have found that people with disabilities experience high levels of multidimensional poverty, such as malnutrition and lower levels of health, barriers to accessing education and healthcare, and exclusion from decent work and social participation (Mitra et al. 2013; Hume-Nixon and Kuper 2018; Mizunoya and Mitra 2013; Mizunoya et al. 2018) . Poverty may even be underestimated amongst people with disabilities, due for example to high out-of-pocket spending on disability-related items (e.g. personal assistance, rehabilitation and assistive devices), intra-household discrimination in the allocation of resources and opportunities, as well as structural inequalities that prevent equal participation in society (Mitra et al. 2017; World Health Organization & World Bank 2011; United Nations 2015) . The combination of spending on extra disability-related costs, social exclusion and opportunity costs from caregiving provided by other household members can lead to increased vulnerability to poverty amongst people with disabilities and their households (Schneider et al. 2011b; Kidd 2017) . In addition to this needs-based argument, the right of people with disabilities to inclusion in social protection is established in international treaties such as Article 28 of the UNCRPD and Articles 22 and 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (United Nations 2016; United Nations General Assembly 1948) . As mandated in the UNCRPD's Article 28, people with disabilities have the right to equitable access to mainstream social protection programmes-such as health insurance, pensions and other benefits where eligibility is not dependent on disability status (Devandas Aguilar 2017; United Nations 2015). Further, disability-targeted programmes may be required to address disability-specific concerns such as the need for rehabilitation and assistive devices, workplace support or specialist education. People with disabilities also frequently face additional costs, such as for extra transportation or medical expenses, which can deepen inequalities in standards of living compared with people without disabilities (Devandas Aguilar 2017; International Labour Organization 2017; Mitra et al. 2017) . Subsidising these additional costs and promoting access to services and support required for full and equal participation are typically the main objectives of disability-targeted programmes. Overall, a central aim of disability-inclusive social protection across both mainstream and targeted schemes is addressing social exclusion (United Nations 2015). For people with disabilities to partake in any of the intended benefits of social protection, they must first be able to access programmes. A recent systematic review found little evidence across LMICs on whether people with disabilities were actually participating in social protection programmes, despite the emphasis placed on targeting people with disabilities as key recipient groups (Banks et al. 2016) . Available evidence, however, suggests that coverage is well below need and many eligible individuals are not accessing programmes (Palmer and Nguyen 2012; Mitra 2005; Saloojee et al. 2007) . Low coverage may be linked to broader social exclusion of people with disabilities; For example, policymakers may not adequately take into account the needs of people with disabilities when designing and delivering social protection-such as in aligning programmes to address disability-specific vulnerabilities to poverty or ensuring application procedures are accessible-due to discrimination, lack of understanding or insufficient political will (Kidd 2017) . For disability-targeted programmes, disability assessment procedures are a frequent cause of exclusion if eligibility criteria are poorly defined or administrative capacity is insufficient to properly implement them (Kidd 2017; Schneider et al. 2011b) . High levels of exclusion are reflected in recent efforts by the International Labour Organization to estimate coverage of people with disabilities in disability-targeted programmes, using regional prevalence estimates of disability from the 2002-2004 World Health Surveys combined with country-level programme enrolment figures. Under this approach, it was estimated that 27.8% of people with ""severe"" disabilities are recipients of a disability-targeted cash benefit, with access differing substantially across regions, with coverage lowest in Asia and the Pacific at 9.4% and highest in Eastern Europe (97%) (International Labour Organization 2017). However, these figures are based on modelled estimates, rather than direct survey, and the definition of ""severe"" disability is unclear. Further, little evidence is available on how enrolment differs amongst people with disabilities, enrolment in non-targeted schemes, or factors affecting access to both mainstream and targeted programmes (Banks et al. 2016) . Consequently, this study explores participation of people with disabilities in social protection programmes, with Tanahun District of Nepal as the study setting. This research uses mixed methods to assess coverage (through direct survey), how coverage varies amongst people with disabilities (e.g. by gender, impairment type), as well as challenges and facilitators to enrolling in or using relevant social protection programmes. This research benefits from a population-based study design and from the use of the Washington Group question sets for measurement of disability, which are internationally validated and recommended for robust and comparable disability statistics, including in the tracking of progress towards the SDGs (Washington Group on Disability Statistics 2009).Overview of Social Protection Entitlements in Nepal Social protection entitlements in Nepal are gradually expanding, particularly social assistance (World Bank 2017). Most social protection entitlements are targeted to various groups deemed to be at greatest risk of poverty and marginalisation, including people with disabilities (Government of Nepal 2015b). There are also a few schemes open to the broader population-namely for social insurance and healthcare provisions-although these are more limited in scope and coverage. While specific aims of social protection in Nepal have not been formally outlined, they are meant to ""maintain a degree of equity among citizens"" and ensure all citizens are able to ""live a decent life"" (Khadka 2017) . Social protection entitlements focus both on alleviating deprivation in income (i.e. social assistance), as well as fostering broader social inclusion (e.g. through educational scholarships, healthcare discounts, employment support) (Khanal 2013) . The range of entitlements offered in Nepal recognise both economic and social challenges facing people with disabilities and other groups experiencing poverty or other forms of deprivation (Barrientos et al. 2016) .Disability-Targeted Social Protection Entitlements Key disability-targeted entitlements are listed in Table 1 (Government of Nepal 2015a , 1982) . In order to be eligible for these entitlements, people with disabilities must first undergo an assessment of disability and receive a disability card. To apply for a disability card, an individual must first submit an application to the Women and Children's District Office (WCDO). The application consists of the following: a letter from the applicant's Village Development Committee (one of the lowest administrative units in Nepal) verifying their identity and place of residence, birth certificate or citizenship card, photographs, and completed application form. The application form includes questions on self-reported type and severity of the disability, any difficulties the person faces because of their disability (e.g. in doing daily chores, working), and the need for assistive devices. Medical documentation and references from Disabled Peoples' Organizations (DPOs) can also be included to support the application, although they are not an explicit requirement. Once the application is processed by the WCDO, the applicant is called for an in-person evaluation, which is typically conducted by the Disability Identification Committee. The Disability Identification Committee comprises representatives from local government offices (e.g. District Health Office, WCDO, District Development Committee) and, if available, from a registered DPO operating in the district. Assessments of disability are informed by an in-person evaluation on the applicant's level of difficulty in performing daily activities and participating in social life, gauged through observation and responses in the application form. Based on the results of the assessment, an individual is classified into one of four disability card categories (from most to least severe: red, blue, yellow, white). The disability card category is based on an assessment of the level of support needed: • Red-""complete disability""-difficulty in performing daily activities, even with the help of others • Blue-""severe disability""-difficulty in performing daily activities without the help of others • Yellow-""moderate disability""-able to perform daily activities and participate in social life if environment is barrier free, and appropriate training and education are provided • White-""mild disability""-ability to perform daily activities and participate in social life if environment is barrier free The disability card classification determines which social protection benefits a person is eligible to receive. While the Disability Allowance is reserved for people with the two most severe card categories (red, blue), the remainder of the benefits are open to disability cardholders of any colour classification. Nationally, 198,788 people were registered as receiving disability cards in the fiscal year 2014/2015 (Government of Nepal 2016a). Slightly under half (93,858) have yellow or white cards, which means they are not eligible for the Disability Allowance. For red and blue cardholders to receive the Disability Allowance, they must submit an additional application to their local Village Development Committee (VDC). Separate applications are also needed for educational scholarships, while other benefits (e.g. health and transport discounts) can be accessed through presentation of the disability card at the point of use.Non-Disability-Targeted Social Protection Entitlements People with disabilities may also be eligible for programmes aimed at other targeted groups, if they meet their eligibility criteria; For example, children may receive educational scholarships for reasons other than disability, such as if they are a girl living in poverty, are from the Karnali Zone or belong to the Dalit caste. The amounts provided through these scholarships vary, but are typically less than is provided for children with disabilities. Similarly, unconditional social assistance is available to older adults (aged 70+ or 60+ for the Karnali Zone/members of Dalit caste), single women over 60, widows, indigenous groups considered to be endangered and for children under 5 from the Dalit caste or who live in the Karnali Zone. Amounts range from NR 200-1000 per month (US $2-9). It is important to note that an individual cannot receive more than one type of social assistance at any one time. People receiving a pension, or on a government salary, are ineligible to receive social assistance (Johnson and Subedi 2017) . Regarding pension schemes, Nepal has been expanding available schemes, although presently all are restricted to formal-sector employees. Pensions are mandatory for public-sector employees, and can be accessed after 20 years of services (16 for military, 13 for people with disabilities) (Khadka 2017) . Voluntary contributory pension schemes are available for formal-sector employees, in which contributions are exempt from income tax. In addition to pensions, public-sector employees and employees of formal-sector businesses with at least ten employees have legal protections covering maternity and sickness leave, as well as provisions for injury, disablement and death due to work-related accidents. Lastly, all Nepali citizens are entitled to some basic healthcare provisions. This includes coverage of some services at lower-level health posts and 60 prescription drugs free of charge. Older adults aged 70 and above can access additional health services without charge, up to an annual limit of NR 4000 (US $38).Methods A mixed methods approach was used to assess access to existing social protection programmes. In-depth qualitative and quantitative research was undertaken in one district in Nepal to measure coverage and uptake of social protection benefits, as well as barriers and enablers to enrolment among people with disabilities. Qualitative interviews were also conducted with national-level stakeholders to contextualise findings within national policies and programmes. For all components, disabilitytargeted entitlements were the main focus, although non-disability-targeted programmes were also explored where possible. Ethical approval for this research was granted by the Ethics Committee at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and the Nepal Health Research Council. Informed written consent was obtained from all study participants prior to beginning any interviews. For children below 16 years (age of consent) and people with impairments that severely limited their ability to understand/communicate, a carer answered on their behalf as a proxy. Data collection was undertaken between August and September 2016.Setting A rapid policy analysis was conducted in 2015 of social protection systems in Asia and the Pacific and the extent to which they were inclusive of people with disabilities (International Centre for Evidence in Disability 2015). From this analysis, Nepal was selected as a study site as it was identified as having a relatively strong social protection system, which had made concerted efforts to be inclusive of people with disabilities, particularly through multiple disability-targeted programmes. Consequently, studying Nepal's system offered an opportunity to identify and describe examples of good practice in disability-inclusive programme design and implementation. Within Nepal, data collection was undertaken in Tanahun. Tanahun is a predominantly rural district in Province No. 4, which is part of the Hills Region. Tanahun was selected as the study setting after consultation with in-country stakeholders who recommended this district due to its strong network of DPOs, adequate availability of disability support services and relatively well-functioning social protection administration. To complement district-level research, qualitative interviews with national-level stakeholders were used to provide an overview of the national context.Quantitative Research in Tanahun Quantitative data collection included a population-based survey of disability across Tanahun, with a nested case-control to compare awareness of and enrolment in social protection programmes between people with and without disabilities. The 2011 national census was used as the sampling frame for the populationbased survey. A two-stage sampling strategy was employed based on methodology used in other surveys (Kuper et al. 2006 ). In the first stage, probability-proportionate-to-size sampling was undertaken to select 30 clusters (wards of VDCs) in Tanahun. In the second stage, 200 people aged 5 years and older were enumerated and recruited in each cluster through compact segment sampling. The sample size of the population-based survey was set at 6000 to ensure the identification of adequate numbers of people with disabilities for the case-control study. For the case-control, a sample of 240 cases with disabilities and 240 controls without disabilities was powered to detect an odds ratio of 1.9, assuming 80% power and a prevalence of exposure (e.g. poverty, the main measure of the broader study) of 25% among controls. Disability Both the adult and child question sets focus on similar activities. For most questions, participants can select one of four response options describing their level of difficulty in performing each activity: none, some, a lot or cannot do at all. Anxiety and depression in the adult set were assessed through a two-part question on intensity and frequency of symptoms. For the purpose of this study, disability was defined as: • Adults (16+): • Reported ""a lot of difficulty"" or ""cannot do"" in at least one of the following domains: seeing, hearing, walking/climbing, communicating (understanding/being understood), remembering/concentrating, self-care, upper-body strength, fine dexterity. • Reported experiencing symptoms of anxiety or depression ""daily"", at a level described as ""a lot"". • Children (5-15): • Caregiver reported that, compared with other children of the same age, the child experienced ""a lot of difficulty"" or ""cannot do"" in at least one of the following domains: seeing, hearing, walking, self-care, understanding, being understood, learning, remembering. Child was worried/sad ""a lot more"" often than other children. Interviewers were instructed to ask each household member about his/her functioning directly, if the person was over the age of consent (16+ years) and present at the time of the household visit. Household heads/caregivers reported on children's and absent members' functioning. The cut-offs used in this study to define disability are in line with the Washington Group guidelines (Washington Group on Disability Statistics 2010), and are comparable to eligibility criteria for disability-targeted social protection in Nepal. Further, a disability severity score was created by summing the level of difficulty across all activities (no difficulty = 0, some difficulty = 1, a lot of difficulty = 2, cannot do = 3; anxiety/depression = 3) and dividing it over the maximum possible score for the two question sets (27 for adults, 21 for children) to obtain a score from 0 to 100%. This method for constructing disability severity has been used in other research (Mitra 2017) . All individuals identified during the household survey as having a disability were recruited into the case-control study. The case-control questionnaire explored in greater depth need for, awareness of and participation in disability-targeted and non-targeted social protection programmes. Each person with a disability (case) was then matched to a person without a disability (control), who was of similar age (± 5 years), the same sex and resided in the same cluster. Controls could not be from households with members with disabilities. Additionally, 92 people with disabilities were recruited from registers of the Disability Allowance. To select participants from registers, 2-3 people were randomly selected from non-selected segments of included clusters. These participants received the same questionnaires as cases recruited in the population-based survey, but they were not matched to controls. All register-recruited and population-based cases who received the Disability Allowance received a third questionnaire, which included questions about the application experience. Trained data collectors administered questionnaires, which had been translated into Nepali and created using Open Data Kit (ODK), using computer tablets. Multivariate regression using STATA 15 was undertaken to compare participation in various schemes between respondents with and without disabilities, controlling for age, sex and location.Qualitative Research In-depth, semi-structured interviews were carried out with people with disabilities who were and were not recipients of social protection (namely disability-targeted programmes), as well as stakeholders in disability and/or social protection in the district. People with disabilities were interviewed about their awareness of disabilitytargeted programmes. Social protection recipients were asked about their experience applying for and participating in different schemes. For stakeholders, interviews focussed on social protection policies and programmes, strengths and challenges of existing programmes, including factors affecting access for people with disabilities. A purposive sample of participants with disabilities was recruited using data collected through the population-based survey. Participants were selected to reflect variation in terms of sex, age (children, working-age and older adults), impairment type and geographic distribution (rural versus urban). Adults with disabilities were interviewed directly; however, in some instances, proxies were used if the individual's impairment severely affected his/her ability to understand or communicate (e.g. people with profound hearing impairments but who had never learnt sign language, severe cognitive/intellectual impairments), even with available supports (e.g. sign language, visual aids). For children, interviews were predominately with caregivers, as young children were unlikely to be directly involved in decisions to apply or manage the application process. In addition, national-, district-and community-level stakeholders were selected through recommendations from in-country advisors (e.g. National Federation of Disabled, Nepal) and snowball sampling. Stakeholders included representatives from relevant government agencies, United Nations agencies, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), DPOs, disability service providers and administrators responsible for social protection implementation. Interviews with all participants were transcribed in Nepali, and a thematic approach was used to analyse findings.Description of the Study Samples For the population-based survey, 6000 household members were included and 5692 screened for disability (response rate 94.9%). Overall, 214 individuals were identified as having a disability [prevalence 3.8%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.3-4.3%]. Prevalence of disability was slightly higher in men compared with women [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.4, 1.0-1.7], and increased substantially with age (from 1.5% in children aged 5-18 to 19.6% in adults aged 76+ , p < 0.001). Overall, 418 people from the population-based survey (209 cases and 209 controls) took part in the case-control study (response rate 97.9%). Cases and controls were well matched by age, gender and location, as there were no significant differences between groups in these characteristics. An additional 92 people with disabilities were recruited from Disability Allowance registers, who were not matched to controls, but received similar questionnaires. For the qualitative research, 35 people with disabilities were recruited (response rate 100%). Of the 35 people, 9 were caregivers of children and 14 involved direct interviews with adults with disabilities. The remaining 12 adults involved people with severe intellectual/cognitive and/or communication impairments. In these instances, proxies either assisted in providing additional information (n = 9) or answered fully on behalf of the participant (n = 3). Within this group, 28 participants had a disability card. By impairment type, the following breakdown was observed: physical/mobility (n = 17), communication (n = 10), vision (n = 5), hearing (n = 5), psychosocial (n = 5), intellectual/cognitive (n = 5); 14 respondents had multiple impairments. Respondents ranged in age from 5 to 86 years (10-17 years: n = 9; 18-64 years: n = 22; 65+ years: n = 4), and there was a near-equal mix by gender (female, n = 19). For key informants, 13 district-and community-level and 15 national-level stakeholders were interviewed.FindingsEnrolment in Social Protection Overall, 65 (31.1%) people with disabilities identified during the population-based survey had a disability card (Table 2 ). This included 34 (52%) people who were eligible for the Disability Allowance (red card, n = 13; blue card, n = 21). The remainder (47%) had lower-level disability cards (yellow card, n = 18; white card, n = 13). Over one-third of all people with disabilities identified in the survey received some form of social assistance, which was significantly higher in comparison with people without disabilities (aOR = 3.0, 95% CI 1.6-5.3). The Old Age Allowance was the predominant form of social assistance received, among both people with and without disabilities. The Old Age Allowance had universally high coverage, as over three-quarters of eligible older adults were enrolled. Coverage of the Disability Allowance was lower at 13.4%. No one who did not meet the study's definition of disability was receiving the Disability Allowance, indicating low inclusion errors. However, six people (7.7%) who had received a disability card of an eligible classification were not receiving the Allowance. Disability cardholders are entitled to a range of benefits other than the Disability Allowance. However, uptake of most of these benefits was low (Table 3 ). Transportation discounts and educational scholarships had the highest uptake (25.5% and 13.0%, respectively). Uptake of these benefits varied by disability card level, with people with the lowest assessed severity more likely to use benefits such as transportation discounts and scholarships. Table 4 compares characteristics of people with disabilities who were and were not disability cardholders. Overall, coverage was highest for children and adults under 50. Coverage was lowest for people with sensory limitations as well as anxiety and depression. People with multiple functional limitations and limitations in selfcare were particularly likely to have a disability card. While older adults with disabilities were less likely to have a disability card, this age group had the highest coverage of social assistance overall, in large part due to the high coverage of the Old Age Allowance (Table 5 ). There was no clear association between functional limitations and receipt of social assistance, although recipients had slightly higher severity scores. Similarly, no differences in the likelihood of receiving social assistance were observed by gender or location.Factors Influencing Enrolment in and Uptake of Social Protection Among People with Disabilities Across study methods, several factors emerged which impacted enrolment in and uptake of social protection among people with disabilities. These factors concerned: (1) geographic accessibility, (2) financial accessibility, (3) determining eligibility, (4) understanding the application process, (5) awareness and perceived utility of programmes and (6) compliance among service providers. These are described in detail below. While the focus was predominantly on disability-targeted schemes, other programmes are also discussed where relevant.Geographic Accessibility In Nepal, applications for disability cards, a precondition to receiving the Disability Allowance and other disability-targeted social protection entitlements, are processed in district headquarters. In contrast, applications for non-disability-targeted social protection benefits are conducted at the more local VDCs, which are geographically nearer. As VDCs cover a relatively small catchment area, few people reported problems travelling to these offices. Getting to district headquarters, however, was cumbersome for many people, particularly for people with mobility limitations or who lived in remote areas. Tanahun covers an area of over 1500 km 2 , much of which is rural with limited roads and transportation links. The lack of accessible transportation in many parts of Tanahun Table 5 Characteristics of recipients of social assistance (disability-targeted and non-targeted) compared with non-recipients with disabilities (population-based survey and register-recruited participants) Note: includes people with disabilities from population-based survey (n = 209) and registers (n = 92) a Adjusted by age, sex and location b Not mutually exclusive (i.e. sum > 100%). Domains derived from Washington Group questions as follows: physical (difficulties walking, with upper-body function or fine dexterity), sensory (hearing/seeing), communication, cognitive (remembering, learning and understanding) c Total across Washington Group domains (0 = no difficulty, 1 = some, 2 = a lot, 3 = cannot do for each domain; 3 = anxiety/depression), divided by maximum score (21 for children, 27 for adults). Scores range from 0 to 100% Score 0.32 (0.17) 0.21 (0.12) 0.12 (0.08-0.15)* and the rest of the country was noted by key informants, people with disabilities and their caregivers alike as compounding difficulties getting to application points. Mirroring these responses, in the quantitative survey of Disability Allowance recipients, over 60% of people who had successfully completed the application process for the disability card reported difficulties getting to the application point. Furthermore, upon reaching the application office, many people were asked to provide medical documentation before their application for the disability card could be processed. Gathering the necessary documentation may involve travel to cities in other districts; For example, there are no ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialists in Tanahun, so people with hearing impairments were required to travel to Pokhara, in the neighbouring district (50 km from the district headquarters of Tanahun) for assessment. In fact, many respondents reported travelling to Pokhara and other cities to get medical documents for a range of different impairments for their applications. These difficulties were also reinforced in the survey of Disability Allowance recipients, as 85% reported needing a medical evaluation, which for 11% required travel outside the district. In recognition of these and other barriers, outreach camps are organised by the WCDO, the District Health Office and community-based organisations. These camps are held in various locations throughout the district so that people can submit applications and undergo an assessment of disability without travel to the district headquarters. Outreach camps were started in Tanahun but have since been rolled out throughout Nepal, and are now mandated in the Disability Identification Card Distribution Guidelines 2008. Still, key informants involved in the process note that, while initially effective, they are looking to ""cut off"" outreach camps as they believe most people have been reached and anyone remaining ""should come on their own as it's too expensive to organise outreach programmes for a few people"".Financial Accessibility Officially, there are no direct costs (i.e. application fees) for submitting applications for any social protection programmes. However, 20% of surveyed Disability Allowance recipients reported paying nominal fees at application points for their application to be processed (mean NPR 266 [US $2.50]). Additionally, indirect costs such as for travel to application points are often incurred. For applications conducted at the VDC, these costs are typically minimal. However, to obtain a disability card, applicants must travel to the district headquarters, which can involve substantially higher transport costs. In the survey, 49% of Disability Allowance recipients noted transportation costs as a challenge. Accommodation costs are also common, as several applicants in the qualitative research reported waiting for several days in the district headquarters to meet with the required officials, for the Disability Identification Committee to assemble or to gather additional documentation. Furthermore, disability card applicants and anyone accompanying them often must forgo time spent on productive activities such as work or schooling; For example, the mother of a young woman with an intellectual impairment highlighted the financial challenges associated with applying for her daughter's disability card. Her costs included travel to the district headquarters and fees at a government hospital for medical documentation. She was fortunate to have family members to stay with while the application process was being completed, otherwise she would have had to pay for room and board. When the application was delayed, she had to leave her daughter with relatives to complete the process, as she had to return to home: ""I requested [to the programme official], 'Don't do such a thing [delay assessment], sir. I am alone, no one at home. I have left cattle at home, sir. In this planting season of Jestha (May/June), don't do this, please make it [the disability card]."" While fortunate to have relatives near the headquarters who could assist with the application when she had to return, others do not have this support.Determining Eligibility In comparison with disability-targeted schemes, determining eligibility for nondisability-targeted programmes is relatively straightforward. All social assistance programmes require a citizenship card for people over 16 or a birth certificate for children. This documentation is sufficient to prove eligibility for the Old Age Allowance, Child's Grant and allowances for endangered indigenous groups. For the Single Women (age 60+)/Widows Allowance, a death or divorce certificate is also needed if the woman was ever married. While several participants reported difficulties gathering these documents, once obtained, assessments of eligibility are mostly clear-cut. Age, caste, ethnicity and marital status are all relatively objective criteria that can be determined directly from these documents. In contrast, determining if a person meets disability eligibility criteria is more complex. Disability assessments for disability cards are based on an applicant's level of difficulty in performing daily activities. The language used in policies and guidelines for defining and categorising disability is broadly in-line with the UNCRPD and the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (World Health Organization 2001); For example, categorisations focus on difficulties performing daily activities, rather than the presence of medical impairments. Further, assessors are instructed to consider the role of individual and environmental characteristics (e.g. availability of support) when assessing functional status. However, guidance documents on how to classify individuals into the four categories-namely the Disability Identification Card Distribution Guideline 2008were perceived as vague. Training of assessors was also reported by key informants to be limited. Consequently, in practice, there is a large degree of subjectivity to the assessment. Key informants familiar with the process reported that, for observable disabilities such as physical impairments, blindness or severe intellectual impairments, assessments were straightforward. However, for mental health conditions or mild to moderate communication and developmental impairments, classifications were more challenging; For example, mental health providers reported that few of their patients had upper-level disability cards even if they had a severe mental health condition. Additionally, functional decline due to ageing is often not considered to be a disability. These attitudes on disability may lead to placement in lower card levels or the denial of a card altogether. The lack of clarity on assessment guidelines combined with a low understanding on the impact of certain impairments among assessors may lead to an overreliance on medical documentation in determining eligibility. When the committee cannot decide on a classification, they will request that the applicant seek a medical assessment by a specialist before making a decision on their application. In the quantitative survey, 85% of disability card holders had been asked to provide medical documentation, which was primarily obtained from the district hospital. This additional requirement can be cumbersome for applicants and leads to a more medical-modelbased assessment rather than one in line with the UNCRPD. In Tanahun, mental health providers and DPOs reported collaborating with the Disability Identification Committee to improve their understanding on the disabling impact of certain impairments and conditions. Across Nepal, registered DPOs are often part of the Disability Identification Committee and can provide input into the disability assessment. In Tanahun, the involvement of DPOs was seen as beneficial by other key informants, and significant weight was given to their recommendations. However, not all districts in Nepal have a registered DPO, and the capacity of some DPOs is limited. A final improvement to determining eligibility was the removal of quotas on the number of blue disability cardholders who could receive the Disability Allowance. Previously, these quotas led to arbitrary rationing decisions, excluding many eligible people with disabilities from the cash transfer. After the removal of the quota, the number of Disability Allowance recipients nearly doubled between 2014/15 and 2015/16 (from 33,578 to 62,320).Understanding the Application Process Across social assistance programmes, a common challenge was the yearly application cycle. Applications not submitted before the one annual deadline must wait an additional year before receiving any allotments. Amongst Disability Allowance recipients in the quantitative survey, almost half (47%) reported waiting over a year between submitting their application to the VDC and receiving their first payment. Similarly, for recipients of the Old Age Allowance, many are not aware that they need to apply the year before they meet the minimum starting age. Applications for disability cards presented further challenges. Many people with disabilities and/or their caregivers assisting with the application process reported being unclear on which documents were needed. Even if they had all required documents, many were asked to provide extra medical documentation to complete the assessment, as described above. Furthermore, since the Disability Identification Committee meets infrequently, applicants may face long waiting periods if they are not aware of the schedule. In the quantitative survey, people who had successfully gotten a disability card reported an average of three visits to application points to complete the process. Lack of clarity on application procedures led to delays or frustration; For example, a father faced many difficulties getting a disability card for his daughter, who is blind and has a hearing impairment. He explained that he needed to go to Pokhara three times and Damauli (district headquarters) four times, as he was told ""this thing or that thing was missing or would not do."" In certain cases, the process appeared so daunting that it deterred starting or continuing an application altogether. Finally, people with disabilities, including disability cardholders, and their caregivers were often not clear on how assessments, including card categorisations, were decided. Most people equate the disability card with the Disability Allowance, so frequently expected to get a cash transfer if they are applying for a card. Lack of awareness about the assessment criteria and the benefits attached to each category can lead to resentment and distrust of the process; For example, several respondents felt assessment decisions came down to political connections, such as the father of a man, aged 49, who has mobility and communication impairments. He did not apply for a card as he believes that lack of afno manchhe (one's acquaintance in power or position) would be a barrier. This perspective was also mirrored by some of the key informants; For example, some felt that those who are ""clever"" and literate go to the district and get the type of card they wish, but those who have greater needs often do not get it. Several provisions were reported to have improved the ease of the application process, particularly for disability-targeted programmes; For example, for all social assistance programmes, policies are being changed to increase the number of annual deadlines. Additionally, in Tanahun and other districts, the involvement of Disability Identification Committees in disability card assessments is limited to complex cases. Since the Disability Identification Committee meets infrequently and irregularly, key informants noted that having the WCDO, the office where applications are first submitted, complete most assessments streamlines the process: wait times are decreased and more predictable, which also improves financial accessibility given that many people travel and reside in the district headquarters while their application is processed. Finally, in Tanahun, key informants reported strong involvement of local DPOs, including in guiding applicants through the application process.Awareness and Perceived Utility of Benefits While awareness of the Disability Allowance and other social assistance programmes was generally high, many people with disabilities and their caregivers did not know about benefits such as transportation and healthcare discounts that are available for lower-level cardholders. Additionally, even if people with disabilities or their caregivers were aware of these programmes, many did not perceive them to be useful. This perception was linked to concerns about the quality and availability of services; For example, public transportation is not available in many parts of Nepal, and vocational training programmes may not offer relevant skills. Similarly, schools might not have adequate resources to support the learning of children with disabilities. Of note, while scholarships are available to any level cardholder, national-level key informants stated that scholarships were not intended for children with the most severe disabilities (red cardholders) as ""they will not be going to school"".Compliance Among Linked Service Providers Particularly for healthcare and transportation discounts, several respondents in the qualitative research reported difficulties accessing benefits at point of use; For example, a 49-year-old woman related that bus drivers scold her when she presents her card for a discount. Similarly, the mother of a man with an intellectual impairment went to the district hospital after hearing about healthcare discounts associated with the disability card. She reported that ""not a drop [of medicine] was given for free"" and was instead told by a staff member that a ""disability card won't do anything in the hospital"". Key informants attributed poor compliance amongst service providers to lack of awareness of disability card benefits, as well as motivation to maximise profits. To improve awareness, the WCDO runs information sessions with transportation owners' organisations and other service providers. However, monitoring and enforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance are admitted to be weak.Discussion This research measured coverage and uptake of disability-targeted and non-targeted social protection programmes among people with disabilities in Nepal, and explored factors that encourage or impede participation. Evidence in this area has thus far been relatively limited (Devereux and Sabates-Wheeler 2004) , so this research can help inform planning and delivery of social protection systems to ensure equitable access for people with disabilities. Few studies have measured social protection enrolment among people with disabilities, in either disability-targeted or non-targeted schemes. Concerning disability-targeted schemes, slightly less than one-third of people with disabilities had a disability card, and only 13.4% were receiving the Disability Allowance. A small portion (7.7%) of eligible cardholders were not receiving the Disability Allowance, which is significantly lower than the 58% exclusion reported in other areas of Nepal in a survey conducted before the removal of quotas for blue card holders (Holmes et al. 2018) . Overall, coverage of the Disability Allowance is slightly higher than the modelled regional estimate for disability-targeted cash benefits, which is estimated at 9.4% for Asia and the Pacific (International Labour Organization 2017). Over one-third of people with disabilities were receiving some type of social assistance, which was much higher compared with people without disabilities. The Old Age Allowance was the main cash transfer accessed amongst both people with and without disabilities, and had universally high coverage. High coverage of the Old Age Allowance amongst older adults as a group has been reported in other research from other areas of Nepal (Johnson and Subedi 2017; HelpAge International 2009) . This research indicates that older adults with disabilities are accessing this cash transfer in equal proportion to older adults without disabilities, indicating equity in access. Among older adults eligible for both the Disability Allowance and the Old Age Allowance, there was a clear preference for the Old Age Allowance. The Old Age Allowance currently provides the same amount as the Disability Allowance for red cardholders, although disability cards also provide access to other benefits (e.g. transportation discounts). However, the application process is much more straightforward for the Old Age Allowance: eligibility is relatively easy to assess, applications are conducted in the local VDC and application procedures are straightforward. In general, disability-targeted schemes in Nepal appear much more challenging for eligible individuals to enrol in than non-targeted schemes. No other schemes require travel to the district headquarters as part of the application process, a requirement that may be particularly onerous for people with disabilities. As people with disabilities are more likely to be living in poverty, meeting the financial costs associated with travel will be more difficult (Banks et al. 2017) . Similarly, the lack of accessible transportation is particularly disadvantageous to people with mobility limitations or in remote areas. Other research, including in other areas of Nepal (Johnson and Subedi 2017; Drucza 2016) , has highlighted that geographic and financial factors can be a barrier to accessing social protection among people with disabilities (Schneider et al. 2011a; Gooding and Marriot 2009; Devandas Aguilar 2017; Kidd 2017) . As many areas of Nepal have even more inaccessible topography compared with Tanahun, such as across the Mountain Region, geographic and financial challenges associated with travelling to district headquarters for disability cards will likely be even greater in these regions. Further, challenges in establishing and applying disability assessment criteria mirror research in other contexts, indicating a widespread challenge in the design and implementation of disability-targeted programmes (Graham et al. 2013; Devandas Aguilar 2017; Schneider et al. 2011a, b) . At the policy level, Nepal's disability assessment guidelines focus on functioning, which is in line with international conceptualisations of disability (United Nations Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights 2006; World Health Organization 2001). Functioning-based assessments can also be more practical to implement than medical-based protocols due to a lower reliance on specialised resources and expertise (Schneider et al. 2011b; Mitra 2005; Gooding and Marriot 2009; Devandas Aguilar 2017; Schneider et al. 2011a; Mont et al. 2016) . However, evidence from Tanahun and other areas of Nepal suggests implementation does not always follow official guidelines (Johnson and Subedi 2017) . The majority of applicants reported requiring medical documentation to complete their application, which was both cumbersome to obtain and moves away from the recommended functioning-based approach to disability assessment. While functioning-based tools for assessing mental health conditions and some other impairments are a global challenge (Mactaggart et al. 2016) , many other disability types can be effectively captured without medical assessment. Additionally, universally low coverage of social insurance (e.g. pensions) and social protection benefits other than cash transfers has been reported in other research from LMICs (Barrientos 2011) . Social insurance is often limited to the formal sector, which covers a minority of people in most LMICs. For Nepal, 90% of the labour force works in the informal sector and are thus ineligible for social insurance (Khadka 2017) . There is some evidence from other countries that people with disabilities are even more likely to work in the informal sector compared with people without disabilities (Mizunoya and Mitra 2013) . Further, women with disabilities are particularly likely to be excluded from social insurance, due to gender as a source of exclusion from employment and greater engagement in unpaid and domestic work (Devandas Aguilar 2017; United Nations 2015). Moreover, the restriction to only receiving one type of social assistance does not account for intersecting dimensions of exclusion (Drucza 2016) ; For example, disability and poverty are both more common in older age (Barrientos et al. 2003; World Health Organization & World Bank 2011) . Older adults with disabilities will thus have to contend with both disability-related costs as well as the loss of income from retirement from the same the allotment. Older adults with disabilities will thus have to cover both disability-related extra costs as well as the loss of income from retirement from one cash transfer, without adjustments in value to account for increased need (Barrientos et al. 2003) . Similarly, single women or widows with disabilities may not be able to cover both daily living costs (if they are not engaged in paid work) on top of disability-related costs from the same allowance. Removing restrictions on the receipt of multiple benefits or varying benefit levels would therefore be more equitable, to account for the multiple sources of vulnerability. Finally, although this study did not measure the impact of receiving social protection, it is unlikely that in its current state social protection will be sufficient in meeting its intended goals among recipients with disabilities in Nepal, particularly in promoting stronger livelihoods and social inclusion. Integrated poverty reduction programmes, which combine income transfers, investments in human capital and improved access to services, are more likely to address chronic poverty and social exclusion compared with pure income transfers (Barrientos 2018; United Nations 2015) . The design of disability-targeted social protection in Nepal has taken this multidimensional approach, by combining the Disability Allowance with linked benefits to strengthen recipients' capabilities (e.g. vocational training, education scholarships) with interventions to increase access to services (e.g. transportation and healthcare discounts). However, low uptake of these linked benefits, due in part to concerns over their quality, availability and lack of compliance among services providers, hampers the effectiveness of these tools. Further, complementary interventions may be needed to address discrimination and marginalisation of disability, as well as of overlapping vulnerabilities (e.g. gender, caste, religion). Still, despite challenges, it is important to note that several changes to policy and practice appear to have improved access to social protection among people with disabilities in Nepal; For example, funding for all social protection has increased, and quotas on the number of Disability Allowance recipients have been removed (Khadka 2017) . Additionally, the involvement of DPOs has increased awareness of disability-targeted programmes, including how to apply. DPOs have been reported to improve understanding of disability among assessors, which may help lead to more equitable classifications. Similarly, outreach camps target financial and geographic barriers to access, as well as improve the ease of the application process. Plans to increase the number of annual deadlines for all social assistance programmes are likely to reduce wait times to receiving payments. Additional research is needed to explore access to social protection among people with disabilities in other areas in Nepal, as well as other countries globally. In particular, assessing the effectiveness of different tools and procedures for functioning-based disability assessment would be useful for social protection planning and implementation. Additionally, more information is needed on the impact of social protection schemes, particularly against intended aims of poverty reduction, strengthening livelihoods, decreasing inequalities and improving social inclusion (International Labour Organization 2012a, b) . Research in other areas of Nepal indicates a high need for social protection among people with disabilities, as they are more likely to be living in poverty and face inequalities in areas such as access to education and work (Eide et al. 2016; Plan International 2014) , which follows international trends (Banks et al. 2017; World Health Organization & World Bank 2011) . Research on the impact of social assistance for people living in poverty more broadly indicates a range of potential positive outcomes, including greater investment in human capital and productive assets, protecting minimum standards of living and shifts in the balance of power in household decision-making regarding resource allocation (Barrientos 2012; Attanasio and Lechene 2002; Case and Menendez 2007; Gertler et al. 2012 ). Whether people with disabilities receiving social assistance and other social protection entitlements share similar benefits is less clear.Strengths and Limitations In interpreting the results of this research, several limitations should be taken into account. Notably, Tanahun was selected to highlight best practices in Nepal's social protection system, and thus may not be reflective of the situation throughout the country. Additionally, the Washington Group questions used to measure disability in the quantitative research may underestimate the prevalence of disability, as they may not capture all forms of functional limitations; For example, certain mental health conditions may not be captured (e.g. bipolar disorder, schizophrenia). However, the experience of people with these types of disabilities was explored through qualitative research. A major strength of this study is the use of mixed methods. Combining qualitative and quantitative research presents an opportunity to measure coverage and uptake, while also exploring the underlying factors affecting those figures. Further, use of mixed methods allowed for triangulation of findings across different respondents and methodologies, which strengthens the validity of key results. Another key strength of this study is that participants were recruited from the general population, which improves the generalisability of results.Conclusions Social assistance remains the dominant form of social protection accessed by people with and without disabilities alike in Tanahun District, with the Old Age Allowance demonstrating universally high coverage. Overall, 37% of people with disabilities were accessing social assistance, which was significantly higher compared with people without disabilities. Few people with or without disabilities were accessing social insurance tied to employment in the formal sector. Many people with disabilities remain excluded from programmes for which they are eligible. Points of exclusion occurred at different stages of design and delivery of social protection, with some strategies proving effective at promoting greater access.Aligning Programme Benefits to the Needs of People with Disabilities In their conception, Nepal's disability-targeted programmes take an integrated approach to poverty reduction as they combine a cash transfer (for certain recipients) with other benefits that could help to strengthen livelihoods and well-being (Barrientos 2018) . However, the quality and availability of linked services, as well as compliance in honouring them among service providers, led to perceptions that they were not worth applying for or using. Further, although the Disability Allowance and other cash transfers are set to double in value in the 2016/2017 fiscal year, it is unlikely that they will cover the range of expenses that people with disabilities and their households often incur, such as disabilityrelated costs and loss of income from household members involved in caregiving or from exclusion of people with disabilities from work (Mitra et al. 2017; Schneider et al. 2011b) . Improving the quality and availability of linked services, as well as the value of the cash transfer, will likely improve the impact of these programmes, as well as encourage greater enrolment. Other programmes take less consideration of the needs of people with disabilities in their design. All social assistance programmes offer a set rate for all recipients, and an individual can only participate in one programme. Removing this restriction to a single scheme or adapting benefit levels could better address poverty stemming from multiple vulnerabilities (Drucza 2016; Kidd 2017) . Similarly, social insurance programmes should be broadened to include the informal sector, in which the majority of Nepali citizens with and without disabilities work.Awareness of Programmes Overall, awareness of the Disability Allowance and other cash transfers was high amongst people with disabilities and their caregivers in Tanahun. However, awareness of some of the non-cash benefits was low, as was a clear understanding of application procedures and eligibility requirements. Clear communication strategies on programme availability and eligibility has been highlighted as an important strategy for minimising exclusion, which will require adaptations to reach people with certain impairments or who are illiterate (Kidd 2017; Gooding and Marriot 2009) . The active involvement of DPOs in Tanahun and other areas of Nepal has been a good strategy for spreading knowledge of disability-targeted programmes, including application procedures. However, adaptations to communication strategies for non-targeted programmes may be needed to ensure people with disabilities receive adequate information.Determining Eligibility Disability-targeted programmes have the most complex assessments of eligibility compared with other social assistance programmes in Nepal. While disability eligibility criteria are in-line with the UNCRPD, administrative capacity is lacking to carry out assessments effectively, which has been reported as a common challenge in other contexts (Kidd 2017; Goldblatt 2009; Devandas Aguilar 2017; Mont et al. 2016) . The involvement of DPOs in assessment committees has been useful in improving understanding of disability, although more rigorous training of assessors is still needed, particularly in areas without a strong DPO presence. Finally, the removal of quotas on Disability Allowances for blue cardholderswhich led to a doubling in the number of Disability Allowance recipients-illustrates the high level of exclusion resulting from arbitrarily rationing access.Application Procedures Disability-targeted programmes had the most cumbersome application procedures compared with other forms of social assistance. A key challenge to enroling in disability-targeted programmes was the requirement to travel to application offices in district capitals, as well as to gather medical documentation. Further, the infrequency and irregularity of assessment board meetings led to further delays, additional costs and frustration amongst applicants. Mobile outreach camps are an important innovation in reducing these challenges, which have also been used successfully in other contexts (SASSA and UNICEF 2013). Additionally, across social assistance programmes, the once annual deadline to register leads to long delays-and potential worsening of poverty and exclusion in the interim (Kidd 2017) . The proposal to increase the number of annual registration deadlines across programmes is a positive change, which will likely improve access as well as impact.was measured using two age-specific question sets created by the Washington Group on Disability Statistics, a group established under the United Nations Statistical Commission (Washington Group on Disability Statistics 2018). This comprised an accepted modification of the Washington Group Extended Question Set on Functioning and the UNICEF/Washington Group Questions on Child Functioning (Washington Group on Disability Statistics 2011; Washington Group on Disability Statistics and UNICEF 2016). The modification of the Extended Set is approved in Washington Group guidelines, and has been used in other research (Washington Group 2017; International Centre for Evidence in Disability 2017). These question sets are in line with the World Health Organization's International Classification of Health, Disability and Functioning-a framework commonly used for conceptualising disability (World Health Organization 2001; World Health Organization & World Bank 2011)-as they focus on an individual's ability to perform routine activities of daily living. These tools have been validated in a variety of settings and are recommended by a wide range of global stakeholders for providing robust and internationally comparable estimates of disability (Washington Group on Disability Statistics 2009).Table 2 2 Social protection coverage among people with and without disabilities (population-based survey participants only) *Statistically significant a Among adults aged 70,+ or 60+ if Dalit caste, as per eligibility requirements b Among widows, and single women aged 60+, as per eligibility requirements c Individual did not necessarily accrue the pension him/herself.

Young Dr. S 90095 Los Angeles CA USA,"Background: Poor early-life nutrition is a major barrier to good health and cognitive development, and is a global health priority. Alive & Thrive (A&T) was a multi-pronged initiative to improve infant and young child feeding behaviors. It aimed to achieve at-scale child health and nutrition improvements via a comprehensive approach that included nutrition counseling by health workers, policy change, social mobilization and mass media activities. This study evaluated the sustainability of activities introduced during A&T implementation (2009)(2010)(2011)(2012)(2013)(2014) in Bangladesh and Vietnam. Methods: This was a mixed methods study that used a quasi-experimental design. Quantitative data (surveys with 668 health workers, and 269 service observations) were collected in 2017; and analysis compared outcomes (primarily dose and fidelity of activities, and capacity) in former A&T intervention areas versus areas that did not receive the full A&T intervention. Additionally, we conducted interviews and focus groups with 218 stakeholders to explore their impressions about the determinants of sustainability, based on a multi-level conceptual framework. Results: After program conclusion, stakeholders perceive declines in mass media campaigns, policy and advocacy activities, and social mobilization activitiesbut counseling activities were institutionalized and continued in both countries. Quantitative data show a persisting modest intervention effect: health workers in intervention areas had significantly higher child feeding knowledge, and in Bangladesh greater self-efficacy and job satisfaction, compared to their counterparts who did not receive the full package of A&T activities. While elements of the program were integrated into routine services, stakeholders noted dilution of the program focus due to competing priorities. Qualitative data suggest that some elements, such as training, monitoring, and evaluation, which were seen as essential to A&T's success, have declined in frequency, quality, coverage, or were eliminated altogether.","Background The first thousand days of life are critical for child nutrition, growth and health outcomes [1] [2] [3] [4] ]yet breastfeeding and complementary feeding practices remain suboptimal in many low-and middle-income countries [4, 5] , and numerous infant and young child feeding (IYCF) interventions have struggled to achieve impact at-scale [6, 7] . A noteworthy exception is the Alive & Thrive initiative (A&T), which was implemented in Bangladesh, Ethiopia and Vietnam between 2009 and 2014 with financing from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation [8] . Evidence indicates that A&T improved IYCF behaviors and outcomes [9] [10] [11] --but little is known about whether the program's activities and effectiveness persisted beyond the end of the project period, nor what factors contributed to sustained activities or outcomes. Sustainability is a critical issue: after a period of rapid growth, global health development assistance has slowed and is showing signs of stagnation if not decline [12] . Scholars, policymakers and practitioners are interested in what factors enable the continuation of externally-funded programs after the initial project period ends [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . International organizations and donors are increasingly attentive to ""graduation"" (i.e., how to transition responsibilities) as funding is phased out [22] [23] [24] . Despite active dialogue, there is little rigorous empirical evidence on the drivers of health program sustainability particularly from low-resource settings [25, 26] . Additionally, the concept of sustainability has evolved for several decades yet there remains little consensus about how to define or measure it [21, [27] [28] [29] . This study aims to add to this literature by using a theory-driven empirical approach to evaluate the sustainability of activities implemented during the A&T project period (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) (2013) (2014) in Bangladesh and Vietnam, by asking: (1) To what extent were activities undertaken during A&T ongoing in Bangladesh and Vietnam, 2 years after the end of external program funding? (2) What were stakeholders' impressions about determinants of the sustainability of the A&T model and activities?MethodsOverview of A&T in Bangladesh and Vietnam The overall objective of A&T in Bangladesh and Vietnam was to demonstrate a large-scale model for achieving IYCF improvements in the participating countries. The exact A&T interventions in each country differed based on extensive formative research and dialogue with partners, but were informed by a common implementation framework and included four main components (and specific activities within each): advocacy, interpersonal communication and community mobilization, mass communication, and strategic use of data [30, 31] . Table 1 provides an overview of these components and activities therein; substantially more detail can be found in previous publications [8, [32] [33] [34] [35] . The program was implemented with subnational variation: only certain geographic areas in each country received the A&T interpersonal counseling (delivered via household visits from health workers in Bangladesh, and via facility-based social franchises in Vietnam called Mặt Trời Bé Thơ, MTBT) and community mobilization activities, while mass media and policy/advocacy activities were implemented nation-wide. Health workers in the intervention areas were trained on IYCF counseling, and given resources (including supportive supervision and ongoing monitoring) to enable high-quality IYCF counseling activities. Sustainability strategies were a key aspect of A&T program design [33, 35] . These detailed which program elements would be most amenable to continuation after the official project period ended, and what resources would be needed in order to sustain their implementation by local partners. Examples included strengthening the policy environment through advocacy, identifying sources for financial support, encouraging adoption of key A&T activities by other implementing partners, disseminating A&T-developed tools to help build capacity, and stimulating demand for services through increased community awareness; for more details and examples from countries see Appendix 1.Framework A recent review identified five different types of definitions of sustainability: those that focus on continuation of activities, on continuation of benefits, on capacity building, on adaptations, and on cost recovery [28] . Some definitions combine these components; e.g., Moore et al. posit that sustainability is a program, intervention or behavior change that continues, with or without adaptations, and produces benefits over time [29] . Other definitions specify a distinct concept of ""sustainment"" as the continuation of structures or processes [25] while others view ""sustainment"" as being about health outcome indicators, versus ""sustainability"" which is about capacity to continue a program or activities [36] . Still others view the process itself as what defines sustainability [19] , or conceptualize sustainability as a complex, non-linear and dynamic system [16, 21, 37] . We take a broad view of sustainability as including activities, structures/processes, stakeholders, and capacity. Table 2 shows how we define, operationalize and measure sustainability in the context of this study. Determinants of sustainability are factors that influence the continuation of program services beyond the initial  period. We posit that these determinantssometimes also called ""capacity for sustainability"" [38] are multilevel influences [19, 21, 39, 40] We conceptualize sustainability determinants and outcomes as distinct, but related and equally critical, constructs [41] : there may be a deterioration of activities, which can influence health worker capacity if the system has not found ways to foster sustainability (through determinants). This deterioration may ultimately affect worker and caregiver behaviors and health outcomes, although these are beyond the scope of this analysis.Study setting and design We collected data in Bangladesh and Vietnam, from areas that had received the full set of program activities (intervention areas), and areas that had not received interpersonal communication nor community mobilization activities (comparison areas). This allows a comparison of outcomes between intervention and comparison areas, in a quasi-experimental design in order to isolate the specific effect that may be attributable to A&T. The evaluation was led by an international team that was not involved with implementing or evaluating the original A&T project. Although Ethiopia participated in A&T during this time, it was not included in this evaluation because it received additional donor support to continue activities, beginning in 2014. A mixed methods study design allowed us to more thoroughly understand both the outcomes and the determinants of sustainability, as well as how these factors are interconnected in each country.Data instruments There were two quantitative data instruments: health worker surveys and service observation checklists; these were informed by previous instruments [42] including from A&T evaluations [8, 31, 34, 43] and from previous surveys aimed at assessing health worker satisfaction and self-efficacy [44] . The main quantitative outcomes were: health worker IYCF knowledge, job satisfaction and selfefficacy (assessed by survey); and number of recommended messages/activities delivered during an IYCF counseling session (assessed by direct observation). There were two qualitative data collection instruments, a semi-structured key informant interview guide and a focus group guide; which were developed based on a previous sustainability study [17] . The interview guides included questions about stakeholders' perspectives of program successes, implementation facilitators and challenges, adaptations, replication, leadership capacity, existing partnerships, service quality, funding sources, monitoring and evaluation processes, and best practices. The focus group guide collected health worker supervisors' views on the continuation of activities postimplementation, adaptations, sources of funding, integration with other programs, replication, implementation challenges and facilitators, human resources training and retention, and quality of services. All instruments were developed first in English and revised with input from each country's research team. The finalized version was translated into the local primary language of each country and verified using a backtranslation process.Site and participant selection Quantitative In Vietnam, 3 of 15 provinces that participated in A&T were selected for quantitative data collection. These were purposively selected to overlap with the provinces that participated in the endline evaluation, and to represent variation in geographic region and in A&T program implementation quality (following discussions with the A&T program). Within these provinces, districts were stratified by whether they had MTBT franchises, and 12 were randomly selected (6 intervention and 6 comparison); within these, up to 3 communes per district were randomly selected (20 communes total). Random sampling of administrative units was conducted using a random number generator. Health workers in sampled areas were recruited from hospitals and commune clinics. All eligible workersdefined as those actively involved in client counseling, and, in intervention areas, who had worked at the health facility during A&T and were exposed to program trainingwere approached and invited to participate in the study. In Bangladesh, the 5 divisions and 10 districts that participated in the A&T endline evaluation were all included here, including the same 20 sub-districts (upazilas) (10 intervention and 10 comparison) as participated in that evaluation. Health workers were identified by first randomly selecting 12 higher-level health workers (Shasthya Kormi/Pushti Kormi) from the roster in selected study areas, and then randomly selecting up to 9 health worker volunteers (Shasthya Shebika/Pushti Shebika) who they supervise. Random selection of health workers from these rosters was conducted using a random number generator. Members of the research team approached selected health workers and invited them to participate in the study. Eligible health worker volunteers had a planned household visit within two days of initial contact by the study team. In both countries, IYCF counseling sessions by the sampled health workers (to pregnant women or caregivers of a child < 24 months) on the day of data collection were observed, if caregivers consented. The full sample selection procedure is illustrated in Appendix 3.Qualitative Key informant interviews (KII) were conducted with a purposive sample of national and sub-national stakeholders in both countries, including policymakers, IYCF experts, and representatives from non-governmental organizations, donors, development partners, and health professionals. Potential participants were identified via discussion with the A&T program and government partners, on the basis of their knowledge about A&T and IYCF activities subsequent to its conclusion. Recruitment stopped once the research team reported reaching data saturation for key questions. Focus group discussions (FGD) were conducted with supervisors and managers of health workers who deliver IYCF services, in intervention areas. Focus group participants were identified based on the sampling frame for quantitative data collection in both countries.Data collection Quantitative Data were collected between January-May 2017, by experienced data collectors who received specific training about this evaluation. After providing informed consent, health workers participated in the survey in a private location (average duration: 48 min, standard deviation 34); data were collected on Samsung tablets using Sur-veyCTO, and the encrypted data were uploaded to a server where they underwent routine quality checks. Experienced research staff (not involved in data collection) conducted quality assurance audits in the field during pilot data collection periods, and provided individual and overall feedback.Qualitative Trained research staff conducted the interviews and focus groups in the local language (Bengali and Vietnamese) in semi-private or private settings (e.g., office, conference room, etc.) where the individual/s worked, to promote comfort and privacy. All interviews and groups were audio recorded with permission from participants. There were four participants in Bangladesh who did not consent to audio record their interviews, so interviewers took detailed notes with quotes. In total, 24 interviews were conducted in Bangladesh (range: 30-90 min) and 121 interviews in Vietnam (range: 45-90 min). Seven groups were conducted in Bangladesh (6-7 participants each) which each lasted from 100 to 160 min in duration and six in Vietnam (4-5 participants each) which each lasted about 60 min in duration. Teams held daily debriefing discussions to discuss challenges and preliminary observations.Data analysis Quantitative All analyses were conducted in Stata v14.2. Knowledge, self-efficacy and job satisfaction scores were standardized to a 100-point scale; as were the service observation scores (which summed the number of tasks performed by the health worker during an IYCF counseling session). Analysis examined differences in these variables between intervention and comparison areas (α = 0.05), including with t-tests, chi-squared tests, and multivariable models. Models for health worker outcomes included geographic fixed effects (province in Vietnam, division in Bangladesh) and robust standard errors, as well as covariates of worker age, years of experience and years of education.Qualitative Audio recordings were transcribed verbatim, and the transcripts were imported to NVivo. A preliminary codebook was based on the study's theoretical framework (with primary and sub-category codes reflective of constructs in Table 2 ). Each country team completed pilot coding on a subset of interviews, and the entire research team discussed these results to address discrepancies and revise code definitions for clarity. Country-specific emergent codes were also identified, discussed, and added to the codebook. For example, there is an electronic reporting system used for IYCF data in one country therefore a specific code was added to ensure content about this reporting system was captured. During these steps of codebook development and refinement, investigators from all teams (Bangladesh, Vietnam, USA) met regularly both in-person and by telephone, to discuss the process and agree on the final version of the codebook. Two researchers from each country team coded the transcripts. Coders met regularly to iteratively review discrepancies, discuss results, and develop thematic summaries. Analyses included examining themes and areas of variation within each country's qualitative data on determinants of sustainability, as well as identification of linkages between sustainability determinants and dimensions. Analytical summaries and exemplary quotes were translated into English by bilingual research staff. Since all qualitative data were collected in the local language, this data analysis process was conducted independently in each study country.Ethical review ThisResultsDescriptive information on study participants can be found in Appendix 4. To what extent were activities undertaken during A&T ongoing in Bangladesh and Vietnam, 2 years after the end of external program funding? In both study countries, some A&T activities were continued via institutionalization after the end of A&T. In Bangladesh, the government incorporated IYCF counseling into its health programs via the Institute of Public Health Nutrition; activities including household visits, growth monitoring, and community-based support groups, are implemented by staff from the Directorate General of Health Services and Directorate General of Family Planning of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. In Vietnam, several provincial governments scaled up the MTBT franchises, and the government added IYCF counseling to the standard package of postnatal services. Policy and advocacy activities have continued in both countries, with coordination and support from the National IYCF Alliance in Bangladesh (established during the A&T project period) and the National Institute of Nutrition in Vietnam. Although both countries have lessened their mass media campaigns, some television advertisements have continued in certain geographies and/or on select occasions. Other activities were substantially curtailed since the end A&T, including the elimination of entire program components and associated activities in Vietnam (social mobilization activities and community groups); and certain core activities, such as monitoring and evaluation, were also reduced in both countries. ""Since the project ended, we stopped reporting because no one asked us to report. I asked Ms. X from commune Y, and she said there was no need to report so I stopped and no one has reprimanded me."" (Vietnam, female, sub-national KII) Interviewees noted cutbacks in counseling frequency due to budget reductions, and particularly mentioned limited or a lack of incentives for health workers to conduct IYCF counseling; competing priorities, especially activities that are income-generating; and waning interest from caregivers in Vietnam. "" [Workers] have started saying that they will sell micronutrient powder rather than demonstrate IYCF … When I ask the reason, they mentioned that they got 200 taka incentives for [IYCF] activities before, but now they get nothing"" (Bangladesh, male, FGD) ""It is practical to be demotivated if you are not receiving any money for work. The [workers] get incentives from various other programs including tuberculosis DOTS [directly observed treatment, short-course], ANC and PNC services, etc."" (Bangladesh, male, sub-national, KII) ""In the past, mothers came easily. The program was new and attractive, and they got a gift after the session. Now there is no gift, and it is no longer a new program, so it is somewhat difficult"" (Vietnam, male, sub-national KII) Strong IYCF training was widely identified as a major achievement of A&Tbut training efforts have substantially decreased, in terms of frequency, type (especially refresher trainings) and mechanisms for ongoing education and support. ""We conduct only an annual training about how to weigh and measure babies and children … Some of the [A&T-] trained staff have retired and their replacements have not been trained due to budget limitations. The district has no budget for training and the province does not conduct it."" (Vietnam, female, sub-national KII) ""Now refresher trainings include all issues, including essential health care, nutrition, tuberculosis … whereas during [A&T], we conducted a full-day refresher training, from 9 am until 4 pm, every quarter during the year, only about IYCF counseling, demonstration, problems they faced during IYCF counseling and their solutions"" (Bangladesh, male, sub-national KII) We also investigated the persistence of health worker capacity to implement the activities post-A&T: knowledge, self-efficacy, and job satisfaction. Despite reductions in training, in both countries IYCF knowledge scores remained significantly higher among health workers in intervention areas versus workers in comparison areas (on average 11 and 14 percentage points in adjusted models, in Vietnam and Bangladesh respectively) (Table 3 ). However, these high knowledge scores did not translate into better counseling: when counseling sessions were observed, workers in intervention areas of both countries performed on average only 36-46% of all recommended activities (Appendix 5). Stakeholders likewise discussed the deteriorating quality of counseling activities post-A&T, during interviews and focus groups in both countries. Time constraints were commonly cited as a barrier. ""It is a time-consuming process. Now, instead of half an hour, they only spend 10 minutes. So the practice is not done properly. Sometimes they use mobile phones for counseling on IYCF, rather than directly demonstrating."" (Bangladesh, male, FGD) ""We do not follow the 8 topics as in the protocol, since it will take too long and women cannot stay so long. They ask for what they need, and we answer. We can also add a little information about nutrition. If we followed the protocol, it would be very difficult to conduct counseling"" (Vietnam, female, FGD) Changes to monitoring, such as cuts in supportive supervision and quality improvement feedback mechanisms, were also noted as a factor affecting counseling. Stakeholders were very enthusiastic about monitoring during A&T, but cited subsequent deterioration in the degree of specificity (i.e., broadening the focus from IYCF to general nutrition indicators) and in feedback mechanisms. ""During [A&T], the monitoring system was effective: one monitor worked for two upazilas [sub-districts], and monitored field activities by rotation, collecting monthly progress reports, and randomly observing workers' IYCF counseling activities. Later we discussed their findings and feedback during the refresher trainings. But post-[A&T], these activities are being supervised by a general monitoring team focused on overall health and nutrition activities, not specific to IYCF"" (Bangladesh, male, sub-national KII) ""No one supervises the counseling session anymore or reviews the monitoring book of client counseling"" (Vietnam, female, sub-national KII) Health workers in intervention areas of Bangladesh nonetheless reported significantly higher job satisfaction (86%) and self-efficacy (93%) scores than workers in comparison areas (scores of 83 and 85% respectively) (Table 4 ). These relationships remained significant in multivariable models, with health workers in intervention areas scoring 7.7 points higher self-efficacy scores and 3.5 points higher job satisfaction scores. No such significant differences were seen among health workers in intervention versus comparison areas of Vietnam.What were stakeholders' impressions about determinants of the sustainability of the A&T model and activities? Qualitative data provided insights into specific determinants of sustainability highlighted in the study's conceptual framework. Respondents from both countries felt that the government should take a leadership role for sustaining IYCF activities; and stakeholders in Vietnam spoke about the importance of involving all levels of the government, noting the important role of the national government in promoting these efforts. ""Government should be the first changer in mainstreaming or implementing the IYCF activities nationwide"" (Bangladesh, female, national KII) ""In order to integrate the program into the existing system in a sustainable manner, it should be start with the national level. If not, it is difficult for the provincial level to implement and integrate without guidance from the national level"" (Vietnam, female, sub-national KII) ""Alive & Thrive was a comprehensive approach with the engagement of government stakeholders, which made the initiative acceptable by all levels of stakeholders."" (Bangladesh, male, national KII) There were, however, concerns about the requisite financial resources for sustaining program activities. ""The modality was good, but who has so much money?... If anyone wants to replicate this in another country without funding from Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, nobody will able to do it in the same way"" (Bangladesh, female, national KII) ""During the [A&T] dissemination workshop, they presented the scaling-up plan and the proposed budget … But we waited and waited, and no funding came."" (Vietnam, male, sub-national KII) Stakeholders in Vietnam were concerned about the sustainability implications of unreliable public sector fund allocation for IYCF, increasing privatization of the health sector, and of omitting IYCF counseling from the national health insurance program. ""I am concerned about how we can continue to provide counseling. In my opinion, if the Ministry of Health advised the government that nutrition and nutrition counseling should be paid by the health insurance, sustainability will be feasible."" (Vietnam, male, sub-national KII) ""In the last two years, the National Nutrition Program budget has been cut significantly. In some provinces, the budget is only 10% of what was planned."" (Vietnam, female, national KII) Partnership, including with civil society, and wide stakeholder buy-in were seen as important for sustainabilitybut stakeholders in both countries worried such efforts struggled without A&T as a coalescing force. ""[The National Institute of Nutrition] is lonely now in the fight … A&T was independent so could link multi-disciplinary partners well."" (Vietnam, female, national KII) Turnover of human resources, at both leadership and implementation levels, was mentioned as a major sustainability challenge in both countries. ""Staff were changed and retired, but the program did not monitor this closely to train new staff"" (Vietnam, female, sub-national KII) ""If one [worker] dropped out, we had to distribute her registers among 8-10 others to manage the regular household visit. This increasing workload causes more dropouts."" (Bangladesh, female, national KII) Table 4 Self-efficacy and job satisfaction of health workers Some respondents also mentioned low IYCF knowledge among new leadership as a challengeand there were concerns about the continuity and long-term commitment of champions and loss of institutional knowledge due to high turnover. ""Sometimes the government appoints a senior person in such designation which requires long experience in the field of nutrition, whereas the person might not have any exposure of nutrition related works"" (Bangladesh, male, national KII) ""The head of [facility A], an active and very good manager of the A&T model, retiredand her replacement does not know much about the activities. In [facility B], the head and the nurse who were trained by A&T have been moved to another facility, and the newcomers do not know about A&T"" (Vietnam, female, sub-national KII) The multi-pronged design of A&T was seen as key to its success, but stakeholders were concerned about sustaining thisparticularly because the varied activities require expertise, support and leadership from different implementing agencies. For example, stakeholders felt as though different groups would best implement interpersonal communication versus mass media efforts, and were concerned that this fragmentation may add coordination challenges and undermine sustainability. Stakeholders also discussed the importance of adaptationsincluding to training and interpersonal communication IYCF counseling materialswhich have occurred during and subsequent to the program period. This flexibility was seen as a key strength of the model and important for integration and sustainability. A more problematic adaptation has been a broadening of scope since the end of A&T: improvements on specific IYCF indicators was seen as evidence of success in both countries, but stakeholders felt as though these have been diluted, and that stakeholders are less familiar with the specific goals. In both countries, this shift was attributed to competing priorities and the introduction of new programs and initiatives. A summary of qualitative findings in each country, mapped to the theoretical constructs of sustainability, is presented in Table 5 .Discussion This sustainability evaluation examined ongoing implementation of Alive & Thrive program activities in Bangladesh and Vietnam more than two years after external funding ceased. We found that many activities specifically aimed at promoting IYCF counseling with caregivers had continued in each country, thus expanding the reach of IYCF counseling services beyond the original program beneficiaries. In Bangladesh, the government successfully incorporated IYCF counseling and household visits into routine health programs. In Vietnam, although the national government was less heavily involved in the program, several provincial governments expanded the IYCF social franchises into new areas, and IYCF counseling is now included in the standard postnatal package for mothers. The results also demonstrate the significant enduring capacity of health workers based on increases in intervention sites compared to comparison sites for health worker IYCF knowledge, self-efficacy, and job satisfaction. These knowledge scores were very similar to the results found in the A&T endline evaluations (see Appendix 6) [9] suggesting little ""voltage drop"" in this outcome over the extended time period [37] . However, in both countries, IYCF counseling activities in the intervention areas appeared to have worsened in quality since the end of the program. For example, during direct observation, many specific recommended IYCF counseling activities were no longer provided. Similarly, a systematic review about program sustainability found that fewer than half of providers, when observed, continued to implement the intervention over time at high levels of fidelity [20] . We also sought to understand why persisting higher knowledge did not necessarily translate into persisting higher-quality counseling as observed in the quantitative results, i.e. observed ""know-do gaps"" --which are welldocumented in the broader public health literature [45] [46] [47] [48] but have not been previously applied in the context of sustainability. A major factor that emerged from the qualitative data was the introduction of new competing incentives (e.g., profits from selling commodities or services) and, in Bangladesh, the suspension of A&Tassociated incentives. Earlier studies of A&T implementation similarly identified performance-based incentives and training/monitoring as instrumental for promoting IYCF counseling fidelity among frontline workers [35, 49] . Other studies have also suggested that incentive payments affect motivation and performance [50] [51] [52] . Although there may be an unavoidable tension between fidelity and adaptation when considering sustainability [20] , researchers should assess the potential impact of different types of incentives (such as titles or training credits) to ensure sustained outcomes over time. Mixed methods studies like this one offer unique opportunities for exploring such mechanisms. Institutionalization is generally viewed as an enabler or a necessary component of sustainability, or even as synonymous with ""sustainability"" itself although there is increasing push-back against this conceptualization [39, 53] but these findings suggest it may have contributed to the decline of some program activities and monitoring. Stakeholders spoke about the importance of an IYCF-focused monitoring system with rapid feedback mechanisms during A&T, and described the detrimental effects of shifting to routine monitoring through existing systems. Previous studies have pointed to the importance of monitoring and feedback for program implementation [54] , but fewer have examined it as a driver of sustainability [20] . Although ""program drift"" may be advisable as programs adapt to real-world long-term implementation [37, 39] , partners may wish to consider counteracting the possible negative consequences of institutionalization, including attempting to maintain program integrity through earmarked budgets, dedicated program staffing, on-going training (particularly to replace rotating staff), topic-/activity-specific mentorship and supportive supervision activities, and detailed indicators in the monitoring system. A broader and more dynamic view that sees sustainability as independent of organizational structures --and not necessarily dependent on or equivalent to institutionalization --may be a more instructive approach for policymakers and planners [19, 39] . The multi-pronged design of A&T has been widely praised as being key to its success, however, it proved to be challenging to sustain, an important lesson for other at-scale complex programs. For example, this study found that many community-based and regional health education and advocacy activities ceased after the end of the project period (including broad mass media messaging and social mobilization efforts) despite stakeholders' perception that these were impactful during the initial project period. Consistent with other sustainability frameworks that point to the importance of a ""champion"" with a strong commitment to the program [18, 26, 55] , we found that champions were important during adoption and implementationbut these champions did not extend beyond the program period, particularly in the context of institutionalization. It may be important to identify and cultivate champions who can be supported beyond the life of a project, to either continue in this role or mentor new ""sustainability champions"" with skills in advocacy and problem solving. This study also identified declines in IYCF-specific budgets in both countries post-A&T. Both public and private sources of financing were perceived to have limitations: allocations of public sector funds can be unreliable, while private sector support may come with new restrictions or different priorities. These funding challenges have caused the sunsetting of entire program categories, alteration (and in some cases narrowing) of target geographies and/or populations, and cuts to activities including health worker IYCF counseling training, and monitoring and evaluation. An examination of changes in funding allocation and sources (private and public) is important for understanding program sustainability [20] as different funding sources present unique benefits and challenges [56] . This model provided IYCF services free of charge; other strategies might seek financing options to establish a more sustainable long-term source of revenue [35] . This study adds to a growing global literature about sustainability [17, 25, 26, [57] [58] [59] [60] with a unique mixed methods study design. We incorporated a strong theoretical foundation, and leveraged a quasi-experimental design to compare measurable and observable outcomes in intervention versus comparison areas over a long post-implementation perioda rare opportunity in implementation research [25, 39] particularly in lowresource settings [41] . Measuring the evolving and complex concept of sustainability remains a challenge. By using qualitative methods to deepen our understanding of how multiple determinants may have affected the quantitatively identified outcomes, we made progress in operationalizing and disentangling the mechanisms of sustainability, yet could not fully capture the dynamic complexity inherent in a sustainable program [37] . Some additional limitations should also be noted. First, these methods were not designed to assess causality. The study was also not designed or powered to compare findings across the two study countries. Additionally, the health worker sample in each country is very differentboth in terms of background/cadre as well as sample size (due to sample selection strategies which differed by country to reflect A&T program structure). On the latter point, it should likewise be noted that the relatively small number of health workers surveyed in Vietnam may have limited our ability to find statistically significant differences between intervention and comparison area groups. Second, response bias may have affected some of these results: health workers may over-or under-state job satisfaction or self-efficacy, and there may have been social desirability bias for qualitative respondents. We tried to minimize these biases by using data collection teams unaffiliated with A&T program implementation, but it impossible to eliminate all such reporting bias. Similarly, the service observation scores may be biased upward due to a Hawthorne effect, or downward if the research assistants faced challenges in accurately documenting all aspects of an IYCF counseling session. Finally, all interviews and focus groups were conducted in each country's local language, and full translations were beyond the scope of this project so separate research teams conducted the qualitative analyses. We implemented multiple quality assurance mechanisms to minimize potential bias by extensively discussing the codebooks and preliminary results, as well as assessing inter-rater reliability on a subset of translated transcripts.Conclusions This research examined the sustainability of a comprehensive set of interventions that were designed and implemented with an explicit sustainability plan. The results suggest that while some program activities have been institutionalized and continue to be implemented after the end of the project, there have been substantial attenuations in implementation of certain activities (while other activities have ceased altogether). Despite this, some program benefits persist including strengthened capacity of health workers in intervention areas. The findings of this study also show that, while many earlier lessons from the field of sustainability research are still valid, there are some nuances that require additional consideration. For example, earlier literature emphasizes the importance of integration of activities into existing institutions. This study found that integration, if not accompanied by mechanisms to maintain program or activity fidelity, may lead to deterioration. The potential benefits of integration should therefore be considered within this context, and the trade-offs between institutionalization and the dimensions of sustainability may vary across activities and contexts. Furthermore, neither robust results nor thorough integration guarantees a continuation of funding, and the search for future funding introduces new challenges for sustainability. It was also found that champions were important during implementation, but strategies should be developed for identifying, cultivating and maintaining champions despite high turnover to ensure a program's sustainability. Future sustainability studies should explore whether programs are diluted, subsumed or transformed due to adaptations such as discontinuation of activities over time [20] . It is likely that further research into the sustainability of innovative projects will produce new and important recommendations for effective sustainability strategies.Table 1 1 Overview of A&T activities Intervention Bangladesh Vietnam component Interpersonal IYCF counseling provided at household level by BRAC health Group and individual IYCF counseling at franchise locations counseling workers (community-based volunteers: Shasthya Shebikas [SS] and within government health system, called Mặt Tr i Bé Thơ Pushti Shebikas [PS]; and health workers: Shasthya Kormis [SK] and (MTBT, ""Little Sun""); IYCF community support groups (in remote Pushti Kormis [PK]) locations) Mass media IYCF television ads, radio programs, community dialogue, quiz IYCF television ads, signs, loudspeaker announcements, website shows and mobile phone app Community BRAC managers led meetings with local stakeholders; village Village health workers made household visits to invite families mobilization theater shows on IYCF to counseling sessions Policy National IYCF Alliance established; workshops with technical National Nutrition Strategy and IYCF Action Plan established; advocacy stakeholders to disseminate IYCF data; engagement with technical support to strengthen national laws/codes journalists Partnerships & alliances Strategic use of data IYCF: Infant and young child feeding MTBT: Mặt Tr i Bé Thơ (""Little Sun"") SS: Shasthya Shebika PS: Pushti Shebika SK: Shasthya Kormi PK: Pushti KormiTable 2 2 Conceptual framework for sustainability evaluation and operationalization of key variables Domain Constructs Operationalization Data source Determinants of Program/project-specific • Clear goals • Interviews and focus groups sustainability factors • Perceived effectiveness ○ Bangladesh: 24 interviews, 43 focus group • Financing participants (7 groups) • Training ○ Vietnam: 121 interviews, 30 focus group • Evaluation/assessment participants (6 groups) • Leadership Organizational factors • Local-level modifiability • Donor/Initiative-client/-community interactions • Project champion • Integration with institutions • Institutional strength/capacities Contextual factors • Concurrent projects/activities • Community characteristics • Political, economic and cultural characteristics Outcomes of Continuation of program • Dose and reach of program • Interviews and focus groups sustainability activities • Adherence to program standards/ ○ Bangladesh: 24 interviews, 43 focus group guidelines participants (7 groups) ○ Vietnam: 121 interviews, 30 focus group participants (6 groups) • Service observation ○ Bangladesh: 242 observations ○ Vietnam: 58 observations Capacity • Knowledge • Health worker surveys • Self-efficacy, job satisfaction ○ Bangladesh: 600 surveys ○ Vietnam: 68 surveysstudy was reviewed and approved by Institutional Review Boards at the Harvard T.H.

Using mixed-methods we examined whether and how the Ethiopian government's public works programme (that includes food or cash transfers for seasonal labour) alongside complementary activities that engage women and men affected IPV. We analysed midline data collected in July-October 2019 from a randomised controlled trial (RCT) designed to measure the added impacts of the complementary programming in the Amhara and Oromia regions. Eligible households for this analysis had at least one child aged 0-35 months and a primary female caregiver who was married, and under 50 years-old (n = 2604). A nested qualitative study was conducted with a sub-sample of RCT participants from February-March 2020; data included seven focus group discussions and 58 in-depth interviews. Male partners of women who reported experiencing IPV were purposively sampled. Ordinary Least Squares regression analyses were used to estimate the average treatment effect of the complementary programming, and sub-analyses were conducted on the poorest ten households from each village who received additional livelihood transfers. Qualitative data were analysed using thematic content analysis. We found no impacts of the complementary programming on IPV in the full sample, but some impacts among the poorest sample. Evidence on pathways found that both the public works and complementary programming decreased poverty-related stress and arguments within relationships and increased emotional wellbeing. There were some impacts on women's empowerment from the complementary programming. However, men's reactions to women's empowerment were mixed. There was strong evidence that engaging men in nutrition behaviour change communication contributed to improving gender relations. Our findings indicate that social protection and complementary programmes have the potential to be gender transformative and prevent the drivers of IPV.","IntroductionCash transfers and Intimate Partner Violence Global estimates indicate that 30% of women experience physical and/or sexual violence by an intimate partner in their lifetime (World Health Organisation, 2021) , with similar estimates in rural Ethiopia (Yitbarek et al., 2019) . Intimate partner violence (IPV) is associated with adverse physical and mental health outcomes, such as injuries, sexually transmitted infections, depression and suicide, among others (Bacchus et al., 2018; Devries et al., 2013) . In addition there are harmful social and economic impacts, such as lost income to women and families, and decreased productivity of survivors, their families and communities (Rogathi et al., 2017; Graves et al., 1995) . Significant resources have been invested to understand what works to prevent IPV, with a particular focus on cost-effective and scalable interventions. Cash transfers and other social safety net programmes have reached approximately 2.5 billion people in low-and middle-income countries, helping women and the most vulnerable members of society (The World Bank, 2018) . These social protection programmes have been designed primarily to reduce poverty and have shown promising impacts on reducing food insecurity (Tiwari et al., 2016) and improving the uptake of health services (Ranganathan and Lagarde, 2012 ). These programmes have not been designed explicitly to reduce IPV. By examining impacts on IPV, however, there is potential to uncover additional benefits that could be leveraged to achieve multi-sectoral objectives. A growing evidence base demonstrates that cash transfers have the potential to reduce IPV. A review by Buller et al. (2018) found that across 22 quantitative and qualitative studies, the majority (73%) showed that cash decreased IPV; the remaining showed mixed and heterogeneous impacts (Buller et al., 2018) . A more recent meta-analysis of 14 experimental and quasi-experimental cash transfer studies found average decreases in physical/sexual IPV (4 percentage points (pp)), emotional abuse (2 pp) and controlling behaviours (4 pp) (Baranov et al., 2021) . The papers reviewed in Buller et al. (2018) provided preliminary evidence of three pathways through which cash can impact IPV, however, the included studies were not designed to rigorously test them (Buller et al., 2018) . The pathways were: 1. Economic security and emotional wellbeing: Operating through a pure 'income effect' of cash into the household, whereby cash increases financial standing and reduces poverty-related stress, leading to improved emotional wellbeing; 2. Intra-household conflict: Capturing the effect of cash in reducing conflict in the couple caused by arguments over tight budgets and daily spending. Alternatively, if money is used for expenditures such as alcohol or tobacco, there is potential for new sources of conflict (although there was less evidence of this occurring); 3. Women's empowerment: Increasing a woman's bargaining power, strengthening her self-worth, and potentially increasing her perceived value to the household through cash and complementary programming (particularly those targeting women)-where effects on IPV depend on men's reaction to her new role and power. Despite the evidence to date, there are still gaps in our understanding of the linkages between cash transfers and IPV. For example, the mechanisms of how cash-or food-for-work versus cash only programmes can affect IPV are not clearly understood, as men and women working outside the home brings an additional dimension to the potential pathways, and women working may challenge traditional gender norms (Perova et al., 2021) . In addition, there are gaps in understanding how complementary programming (cash plus) can be used to leverage impacts of cash on IPV and ensure reductions in IPV from cash-or-food-for-work programmes. Qualitative studies embedded in impact evaluations can aid in unpacking and refining hypothesised mechanisms, increase our understanding of the role of design components and/or complementary activities, while obtaining an in-depth understanding of lived experiences (Barrington et al., 2021) . The context for this study is the Government of Ethiopia's national social safety net programme called The Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP) that provides poor, rural households food or cash payments in exchange for seasonal labour in public works, and unconditional cash transfers to households whose main income earners are elderly or disabled. To strengthen the programme and expand its impacts, complementary livelihood, nutrition, gender and natural resource management activities are implemented through an integrated programme called Strengthen PSNP4 Institutions and Resilience (SPIR) Development Food Security Activity (DFSA) . A randomised controlled trial (RCT) was conducted to measure the causal impact of key activities of the SPIR DFSA programme on livelihood, food security, nutrition, and women's wellbeing, including IPV. As a complement to the main impact evaluation, a qualitative study was embedded to unpack the impacts on IPV. Specifically, motivated by gaps in the literature and guided by the Buller et al. (2018) pathways this mixed-methods study explored the following research questions: 1) how does the public works programme (PSNP) and the inclusion of complementary activities (SPIR) affect IPV? 2) how do men respond to women's empowerment? and 3) how does engaging men and women together in complementary activities affect gender roles and gender equitable attitudes. While the RCT was designed to evaluate the added impacts of complementary activities and not the impacts of public works only, the qualitative study delves more deeply into how public works may affect IPV. Further, by triangulating qualitative and quantitative data, we contribute to the evidence by expanding the Buller et al. (2018) conceptual framework and hypothesise how public works and complementary programmes affect IPV.Programme background PSNP in Ethiopia is one of the largest social protection programmes in Sub-Saharan Africa. Public works beneficiaries are entitled to five days of work per month over six months per registered individual, which can be divided across able bodied adult household members (for example, a household with three registered individuals are eligible for 15 days of payment). The daily wage rate in 2019/2020 was 41 Birr (exchange rate March 2020: $1.26) in Oromia and 42 Birr ($1.29) in Amhara, or 15 kgs of cereal/month (Ministry of Agriculture, 2012) . Public works payments typically account for 80-85% of all PSNP payments (Hirvonen and Hoddinott, 2020) . SPIR is a five-year project (2016-2021) supporting the implementation of PSNP4 (the fourth iteration of the programme), and complementary activities. Through funding from the United States Agency for International Development's (USAID) Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance, and in collaboration with the Government of Ethiopia, World Vision leads the implementation of SPIR. The main objectives are to enhance resilience to shocks and improve food security and nutrition for vulnerable, rural households. SPIR targets over 500,000 PNSP4 beneficiaries in 15 of the most vulnerable districts in Amhara and Oromia. Based on the Ethiopian demographic and health survey (DHS) data, Oromia has a higher prevalence of physical, sexual and emotional violence against women at 28.9%, 13.2% and 23% respectively, compared to Amhara at 19%, 8% and 23%, respectively (Yitbarek et al., 2019) . Gender norms in the regions are patriarchal and traditional, with men considered heads of the family with control over land and economic resources, and women expected to be dependent on and subordinate to men (Alemu, 2007; Semahegn et al., 2013) . The impact evaluation focuses on the livelihood (L) and nutrition (N) activities of the SPIR programming, in addition to enhanced versions on these activities (L* and N*) (see Fig. 1 and supplementary file (S) 1 for more information).Hypothesised pathways of change Public works programmes have the potential to affect IPV through the three pathways hypothesised in Buller et al. (2018) . The link of payments to public works, however, adds another dimension to all three pathways: having work may improve beneficiaries' emotional wellbeing, thereby reducing IPV (pathway 1); work also means beneficiaries are away from the home, thereby reducing the potential time for arguments and conflict (pathway 2); providing women with work may also increase her financial autonomy and self-efficacy. Whether this increased economic empowerment reduces IPV depends on her partner's reaction to her status and position (pathway 3). Women working outside the home, however, may directly challenge traditional gender roles and this may lead to more violence if men feel women are taking their positions as breadwinners, or if women spend less time on household tasks. Women's empowerment is defined broadly here as improving the ability of women to access health, education, earning opportunities, rights, and political participation and this may vary by context (Hidrobo and Fernald, 2013) . The SPIR activities also have the potential to affect IPV through the same pathways hypothesised in Buller et al. (2018) and through additional pathways directly related to engaging men and women in gender transformative complementary activities. The main SPIR livelihood activities (L) are organised around Village Economic and Social Associations (VESA) groups that serve as a platform for trainings and activities around financial literacy, promotion of savings and credit use, and agriculture and livestock value chain development. The transfer of information and links to social networks could potentially improve households economic security and emotional wellbeing (pathway 1), while bringing women and men together to discuss financial issues could reduce conflict in the household (pathway 2) and empower women (pathway 3) (Gram et al., 2020) . The enhanced L* activities strengthen these relationships. In particular, the livelihood transfers (one-time poultry or cash transfers valued at $200) may not only improve a household's wellbeing, but by targeting women may also empower them. Lastly, the aspirations activities involve a one-time screening of short documentary films designed to motivate individuals to undertake actions to improve their future wellbeing. The SPIR nutrition package (N) includes social behaviour change communication (BCC) on optimal child feeding practices and nutrition, as well as water, sanitation and health activities. The transfer of information from the BCC and WASH activities could improve the family's health thereby improving the household's emotional wellbeing (pathway 1) and increase women's knowledge and agency as women feel better informed in making decisions (pathway 3). The group-based structure may also lead to increased social interactions which may also improve her emotional wellbeing, increase her agency, and provide outlets for escaping IPV (Gram et al., 2020; Roy et al., 2019) . N* also includes Interpersonal Therapy in Groups to address depression, which may also improve a household's emotional wellbeing. The SPIR activities also include components that are gender transformative that lead to a fourth hypothesised pathway. In particular, the Social Analysis and Action (SAA) activities address restrictive social norms, beliefs, and practices around gender that may empower women and improve how men react to women's increased power. (Dunkle et al., 2020) . By involving men in BCC and Timed and Targeted Counselling (TTC) activities, the N* activities are also gender transformative. For example, both the TTC and BCC activities which includes household nutrition and feeding counselling, encourages men to support their wives in childcare that may improve gender roles in the household.MethodsStudy design We used a mixed-methods design (Flick, 2018) composed of midline data from a quantitative impact evaluation and a nested qualitative study. The integration of the quantitative and qualitative data began by recruiting the sub-sample of men and women for the nested qualitative study from the population of participants who completed the quantitative survey. We then integrated the two data methods by triangulating the qualitative and quantitative findings, and interpreting and discussing them together (Fetters et al., 2013) . As the primary focus of the paper was to understand the pathways through which public works and the complementary activities affect IPV, the quantitative outcomes chosen for analysis were not pre-determined and were based on qualitative evidence of pathways of impact and for which we had quantitative data to triangulate the finding. We include an outcomes table that maps the quantitative outcomes to the relevant pathways and provides detail on how each outcome within the pathways is defined (please see S2). The impact evaluation was an RCT that compared combinations of complementary activities by randomly assigning 196 kebeles (villages) across 13 woredas (districts) in Amhara and Oromia to one of four treatment arms: T1 (L* + N*); T2 (L* + N); T3 (L + N*); T4 Control (PSNP only). Within L*, kebeles were randomised to receive either cash or poultry grants with and without the aspirations intervention (see S 3). The impact evaluation was registered at American Economic Association (AEA) registry (AEARCTR-0008281) and details of the randomisation can be found in the baseline report (Alderman et al., 2019) . This mixed-methods study was conceived after the main impact evaluation was designed and was not part of the pre-analysis plan of the main impact evaluation.Data collection and sampleQuantitative sampling and data collection The main impact evaluation included three rounds of data collection: a baseline survey before SPIR activities were rolled out (February-April 2018), a midline survey (July-October 2019) and an endline survey (February-March 2021). For recruitment, 18 households were randomly sampled at baseline in each kebele. The inclusion criteria were that households had to: 1) be a PSNP client household, 2) have at least one child aged 0-35 months, and 3) have the mother or primary female caregiver of the child be a member of the household. All survey rounds included a household, female, and male survey, the latter two were administered to the primary female caregiver (""primary female"") and her spouse (""primary male"") separately. Of the 196 initial kebeles, four were subsequently dropped due to not having PSNP beneficiaries or having security issues. Baseline data was successfully collected on 3314 households across 192 kebeles, of which 3220 households were subsequently re-interviewed at midline (see Fig. 2 ). The sample used in this analysis are 2604 households at midline with a primary female that is married and less than 50 years old. This is the relevant sample for studying IPV and for which qualitative data was collected. Of the 2604 households with data on the primary female, 2348 households also administered the primary male survey and 1610 households had data on IPV. Attrition is not correlated with treatment for any of the three samples used in the analysis (S4 Table A1 ).Qualitative sampling and data collection The nested qualitative IPV study occurred seven months after the midline survey (February-March 2020) in the same study regions as the impact evaluation. A sub-sample of men and women were recruited for the qualitative study from the participants who completed the quantitative midline survey. We conducted seven focus groups discussions (FGDs) and 58 in-depth interviews (IDIs), with men and women in Amhara, and men only in Oromia (Table 1 ). We oversampled men to help answer research questions 2 and 3, exploring how men respond to women's empowerment, and if and how engaging men and women together in complementary activities affect household dynamics. Data collection was conducted by a local research partner. Study participants were sampled across three kebeles in treatment arms 2 and 3 each, and two kebeles in the control arm. This enabled a comparison between the subset of complementary activities and PSNP only. We conducted five FGDs in Amhara and two in Oromia, each containing six to ten participants. For the female FGDs in Amhara we sampled a subset of married women under 50 years, two included women who had attended SPIR L* or N* complementary programmes, and the third with those in the control arm. For the male FGDs in Amhara and Oromia, we sampled men under 70 years who were partners of women who reported experiencing IPV. For the female IDIs we sampled married women under 50 years who had reported experiencing lifetime IPV, had attended L* or N* activities, and had a partner under 70 years. Sampled men for the IDIs were partners of women under 50 years who reported experiencing IPV. For both FGDs and IDIs, men sampled were not partners of women sampled to maintain safety and confidentiality. FGDs were used to collect normative views, while IDIs were used to obtain personal views and experiences. Given the sensitive nature of the topic, IDIs provided a private space for discussions on personal experiences of IPV (questions on personal experiences of IPV were not discussed in the FGDs). The FGDs and IDIs were semi-structured and topic guides explored gender norms, experiences and perceptions of PSNP and complementary activities and how they affected household dynamics and IPV, including men's responses to women's empowerment and women's perspectives on their partner's engagement in complementary activities. Prior to data collection interviewers underwent ten days of training on the ethics of collection violence data based on World Health Organisation's (WHO) ethical guidelines. Topics covered ethical considerations across all stages in the research cycle: informed consent, intensive training on asking IPV-related questions, the safety of respondents and data collection team, confidentiality of data, access to support services through appropriate referral pathways, interviewer self-care, and the referral protocol. Interviewers were experienced social scientists with undergraduate or graduate degrees. We conducted the FGDs in central community locations that were convenient for participants, and IDIs in private locations that ensured confidentiality and comfort. FGDs were conducted by a moderator and an observer who took notes and lasted approximately 1.5-3 hours. IDIs were conducted by sex matched interviewees and lasted approximately 90 minutes. Prior to the start of the FGDs and IDIs informed consent was taken. Participants were offered food and refreshments and reimbursed for transport costs, but we did not offer monetary incentives to participate in the study. The FGDs and IDIs were conducted in either Amharaic or Oromifa, digitally recorded, and then translated and transcribed verbatim into English.Data analysis 2.3.1. Qualitative analysis We conducted a thematic content analysis consisting of four steps: 1) Reading for content: we familiarised ourselves with the content and emergent themes were noted (Braun and Clarke, 2006) ; 2) Coding: we created codes based on identified themes and assigned them to specific sections of text (Saldana, 2009) . To ensure inter-coder reliability, a sample of 15 data-rich transcripts were double-coded; 3) Displaying: We then worked within each code to identify principle sub-themes that reflected finer distinctions in the data. (Saldana, 2009) ; 4) Interpretation: Emergent findings were refined in collaboration with the local researchers who collected the data and referred to the original language for clarification, if needed. Fig. 2 . Flow chart of survey participants.Quantitative analysis For this analysis, we estimated the average treatment effect of each arm (T1, T2 and T3) over all cross-randomised sub-treatments using Ordinary Least Squares. For a few outcomes, we also estimated the impact of SPIR on the sample that was eligible to receive the livelihood transfers; the poorest ten out of 18 households in each kebele were identified as eligible for cash or poultry transfers. Although only households in T1 and T2 received the livelihood transfer, the identification of the poorest ten households was conducted across all four treatment arms. For this sample, we estimated the average treatment effect of each treatment crossed with the poultry or cash (T1*cash, T1*poultry, T2*cash, T2*poultry, T3) against the control. We then estimated the average effect of T1 and T2 as the linear combination (mean) of the coefficients on the cash and poultry interventions, and similarly we estimated the average effect of poultry and cash (these effects average the impact of the aspirations sub-treatment).Ethics The impact evaluation was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the International Food Policy Research Institute and Hawassa University, Ethiopia. We received ethics approval for the qualitative study from the Ethics Committee in Ethiopia and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (ref: 17956) .Results To contextualise the study, we first describe sample characteristics, gender roles and perceptions of IPV. We then structure our results around the research questions we sought to answer: 1) pathways between the PSNP and SPIR activities and IPV, including men's reactions to women's empowerment; and 2) the impact of male engagement in gender transformative complementary activities. Given that the quantitative evaluation was only designed to assess the added impacts of SPIR and not the impacts of PSNP, we provide quantitative evidence only for the pathways between the SPIR programme and IPV. We also use the quantitative results on pathways to triangulate the qualitative findings. We highlight perceived unintended consequences of the programme when describing each pathway in the few instances they arise.ContextQuantitative sample characteristics In comparison to Amhara, fewer households in Oromia were headed by women (4.7% versus 11.0%), the average household size was larger (6.7 versus 5.4 members), fewer women had access to education (18.6% versus 23.1%) and more women experienced physical IPV in the last 13 months (10.3% versus 4.0%) (S4, Table A2 ). Baseline characteristics were well balanced across the four treatment arms (S4, Table A3 ).Gender roles and perceptions of IPV Almost universally men were reported to be responsible for providing for their families and subsisted on farming or livestock rearing. Women were primarily responsible for household tasks and childcare, and they reported their own responsibilities exceeded those of men: Everything a woman does has no end and is hard work … He can have fun in his leisure time. But women have no rest and on top of that she has to manage the children. -Woman, ~40 years-old, Amhara, IDI 24, PSNP only There were some variations in participants' perceptions of IPV. For instance, most participants agreed that physical violence was unacceptable, however, some stated that it was acceptable as a form of disciplinary action when women did not complete their household responsibilities or obey their husband. This belief was held equally by men and women: If he told her not to go somewhere and if she did … then it is not violence … It teaches her to obey him … she is not fond of being beaten but she learns something. -Woman, 25 years-old, Amhara, IDI 22, L + N* Most participants also reported that a man forcing his wife to have sex constituted a form of violence, however, some participants disagreed with this, stating that sex is a marital right and as long as there is no physical harm, non-consensual sex is acceptable. Emotional abuse, on the other hand, was unanimously reported to be the most socially unacceptable form of IPV: No matter how … beautiful or ugly; and good or bad … a woman deserves respect from her husband. Once man and woman are engaged in a marital life, they are tied to each other by blood and have to care for one another's dignity. -Man, 50 years-old, Oromia, IDI 40, L + N* Like physical IPV, however, emotional abuse was sometimes condoned if it was in retaliation to the woman not conforming to gendered expectations or male authority.Public works (PSNP) and pathways to IPV We found some qualitative evidence of PSNP reducing marital conflicts through pathways 1 and 2 put forth by Buller et al. (2018) , but no evidence of an impact of PSNP on women's empowerment (pathway 3).Pathway 1: Economic security and emotional wellbeing PSNP contributed to a partial alleviation of household economic stress and improved wellbeing. Prior to joining PSNP, many male participants reported difficulty finding local work and travelled long distances to provide for their families. This struggle to provide increased stress and led to food insecurity within the household. For example, when discussing his situation before PSNP a man said: It was stressful … We had neither enough farmland nor support from PSNP and it was difficult to feed our children -Man, 46 years-old, Amhara, IDI 15, L + N* In a couple of extreme cases men reported that this led to feelings of hopelessness and suicidal ideation:  money brought by PSNP and reported that in addition to providing financial benefits it gave them a sense of purpose. Some participants, however, reported frustration over the inability to improve their economic situation solely through PSNP, thereby attenuating potential impacts on IPV. Participants reported that the time they spent working for the programme detracted from working on their own farms, or at more lucrative work that although erratic, may have yielded more economic benefits: When we work as day labourers […] we earn 70-100 birr (US $1.5-2.2) per day but we get 42 birr ($0.92) per day when we work for the Safety Net Project [PSNP] . As one gutcheye [3-5kg tin cup] of cereal is sold with around 24 birr ($0.53), we are almost working for free and that is the weakness [of PSNP]. -Woman, 33 years-old, Amhara, FGD 3, PSNP onlyPathway 2: intra-household conflict We found that participation in PSNP resulted in some reductions in intra-household conflict and improvements in relationship quality. Many participants reported that PSNP helped reduce stress about meeting basic needs, and this led to decreases in couples' arguments: When there is no money in your household … this results in disagreements and quarrels in the families. When this shortage of money is solved with the transfer [PSNP] , the existing problems and quarrels decrease because the issue is solved. -Man, 30 years-old, Oromia, FGD 7, L*+N A couple of participants reported arguments over the use of the cash, but these were minor: Yes, there were arguments, but it was only to ensure the best use of the money. However, the arguments always finish with agreement. -Man, 46 years-old, Amhara, IDI 15, L + N* One female participant, however, reported that women's participation in PSNP increased tensions as it decreased their time to complete household tasks: Because we stay out with the men all day [working for PSNP], the housework won't be finished and the husbands are not happy about that. -Woman, 30 years-old, Amhara, FGD 5, L + N* This quote highlights that unlike unconditional cash transfer programmes, cash and/or food-for-work programmes may bring additional tensions to the couple, especially in societies with patriarchal gender roles. Only one participant spoke of how PSNP impacted IPV, stating a decrease in his perpetration but not an end to it: [Before we participated in PSNP] we had some disagreements which, as usual, were happening when the living situation got worse … we had nothing to eat; the disagreements turned to violence … I beat her … [after participating in the program] it [violence] happens but has reduced […] it is not as it was previously. -Man, 23 years-old, Amhara, IDI 7, L*+NSPIR (nutrition* and livelihoods*) and pathways to IPVImpacts of SPIR on IPV Quantitatively, we find no impacts on past year experience of IPV across any treatment arm for the full sample (Table 2 ). In the sample of households who were eligible for the livelihood grants, however, we found some evidence of decreases in reports of physical and sexual violence from the T2 cash and poultry interventions when compared to the control arm (Table 3 ). Looking at the average effect of T1 or T2 across cash and poultry, or the average effect of cash and poultry across T1 and T2, we found decreases in sexual violence in the past year of T2 (L*+ N) and the poultry package (second panel of Table 3 ). These results are robust to multiple hypothesis testing (S4 Table A6 ). Although evidence of decreases in IPV were limited, we found quantitative and qualitative evidence in support of all three pathways hypothesised in Buller et al. (2018) . In pathway 1, the VESA savings group and livelihood transfers appeared to be particularly effective at reducing economic stress, whilst in pathway 2 financial arguments were reduced by women gaining economic independence through VESA, livelihoods and gardening. In pathway 3, in addition to activities that increased women's economic independence, the nutrition education programmes were found to increase women's empowerment, however, qualitative evidence was limited to Amhara. Evidence also suggests that not all men accepted female empowerment, and in some instances, men appeared to still want to retain control of household decisions. Finally, we found evidence of a fourth pathway specific to the SPIR activities. In particular, we found that engaging men and women in VESA, SAA and nutrition BCC activities led to more equitable sharing of household tasks and mutual respect.Pathway 1: Economic security and emotional wellbeing Participants reported many benefits from SPIR including learning about financial savings, crop production and nutrition. This reportedly reduced food insecurity and associated stress, and increased family savings. The VESA savings groups were especially popular with participants because they provided them with financial security: Before SPIR, we had no savings. If we faced any urgent problems, it was hard to get someone to lend us money. Even if someone was there, he asks for interest, which is against our Muslim religion; therefore, I used to feel insecure and worry. Now we have a savings group … and we can use the money for emergencies and even to start a small business. -Man, 45 years-old Amhara, IDI 8, L + N* Another man further explained how PSNP and VESA activities helped him provide for his family:Sometimes, even the daily labour work might not be available, and it bothered me … if my children got sick what would I do? How could I buy their educational materials? Now, since I am included in the safety net [PSNP] … and the SPIR, particularly VESA, [the programmes] have been relieving my burdens. -Man, 44 years-old, Amhara, IDI 13, L + N* Some participants also reported that their families' participation in the poultry and cash grant and VESA savings programme increased their status in the community as they were no longer perceived as poor:I: Has training and poultry business changed your status in the eyes of the community? P: Yes, [status in the community has changed] a lot. If I could not sell the eggs from chickens, I would not [have] been able to buy crop and seed. But now I am happy because I buy seed and fertiliser and am able to produce [crops]. Woman, 22 years-old, Amhara, IDI 38, L*+N, recipient of poultry Previously, when I approached people they usually felt that 'he is going to beg something' … But after we started participating in this programme [VESA], we get good respect … -Man, 35 years-old, Oromia, IDI 46, L*+N, recipient of cash This participant also described how SPIR increased emotional wellbeing for him and his family: I was thinking of assassinating myself … Because she did not stop asking for resources to fulfil the needs of the family … She requested me to give her something, but I can't … But, after we started in the programme we are living happily without any problem. -Man, 35 years-old, Oromia, IDI 46, L*+N, recipient of cash Consistent with the qualitative findings, quantitative results showed that all three treatment arms led to increases in savings and accessing resources from VESA (Table 4 ). However, while T2 (L*+N) and T3 (L + N*) led to decreases in men's financial worry, there was no decrease in depressive symptoms (S4, Table A4 ). Despite promising results, participants highlighted that IPV cannot be resolved by tackling income shortage alone. For example, when asked whether the livelihoods component reduced tensions and violence in the household, a participant said: There are some men who have [an] argumentative personality and do not care for their household. If the problem was due to income shortage the situation can be changed, if it is natural behaviour it is hard to change. -Man, 45 years-old, Amhara, FGD 1, L*+NPathway 2: intra-household conflict Across three FGDs and three IDIs participants reported that SPIR improved their relationship quality by decreasing arguments about money. The vegetable garden was highlighted as an effective intervention that enabled women to become more financially independent: Because we are not buying food from the market, we do not quarrel with the husbands about money … I do not ask my husband for money as much as I used to, and because I won't be disappointed if he tells me he does not have any, I think our relationship is better. Also because I do not ask him for money, he comes home with good vibes. -Woman, 28 years-old, Amhara, FGD 5, Participant 4, L + N* There was also evidence from a focus group that recipients of the poultry livelihood intervention experienced improved relationships: It [SPIR] decreases such problems, because women are starting to earn her own earnings from the chickens she is rearing, and able to cover her own expenses, and she is independent, and [there are] no arguments when she asks for money -Man, 38 years-old, Amhara, FGD 1, L*+N, recipient of poultry A male participant made an explicit link between reductions in arguments due to VESA and reductions in IPV: [are] solved and she can manage everything. -Man, 22 years-old, Oromia, FGD 7, L*+NBefore she asked me to give her money to purchase basic item[s] for the family. And, I did not have money … this might result in quarrelling and violence. Now […]she is involved in groups with neighbourhood women [ …] She saves money with [the] group [VESA] … and uses the money to purchase essential goods. Now, we don't have any quarrels and violence in the household because the problems that cause itPathway 3: Women's empowerment -increases in self-confidence, independence and knowledge Although we did not find evidence in support of pathway 3 in Oromia, in Amhara a few women reported that they felt empowered to contribute financially to the household through participation in VESA groups and vegetable gardens. This financial independence made them more confident, and allowed them to further participate in community activities: Before [SPIR] , when my neighbours would ask me to go to a funeral with them and share some of the cost of the food … I couldn't afford to contribute the money so I just wouldn't go with them. But now, I can afford to do that. -Woman, 34 years-old, Amhara, IDI 35, L*+N Participants also reported that women shared the information they received from nutrition trainings with their neighbours, thus becoming role models in the community and improving their status: We share the information from the [nutrition] trainings at home, which my wife shares with [the] neighbours, she has been receiving good impression [appreciation] from them. -Man, 44 years-old, Amhara, IDI 13, L + N* Some women also described how the nutrition trainings increased their husbands respect for them and their financial decision-making power:Even though he never accepts what I tell him, when I tell him what food is good for the children … he has started to realise what I tell him [is true]. When I go to the market he would give me money and would be like, 'if you are using it to cook those foods, I will give you more.' -Woman, 33 years-old, Amhara, IDI 23, L + N* For one participant, being a member of the VESA group boosted her self-confidence enough to overcome her fear of leaving her abusive husband: I used to wonder if everyone's life is like that. But after the group meetings I understand that no one should live like me … I shouldn't be controlled by my husband. I used to be afraid of leaving him, and my future … but after I received the trainings and talking with the group, I started to believe that I can work and provide for my family by myself. I am not afraid to be alone anymore. -Woman, 30 years-old, Amhara, IDI 32, L*+N However, leaving her husband did not resolve all issues as he reportedly then tried to gain custody of the children to access the PSNP money. Consistent with the qualitative results, we found large, significant increases in women's financial decision-making across all three arms but no impacts on self-efficacy (Table 5 ). Despite positive changes in women's empowerment, there is recognition that male partner responses complicate this pathway to IPV. Although most men accepted their wives earning money and gaining knowledge, this was not always the case. For example, a woman noted that her husband was unhappy with her sharing knowledge from the nutrition trainings with neighbours: He just doesn't see it [sharing the nutrition trainings with other women] as good. I do these things when he is away from home [ …] since I believe it's a responsibility and the education is very much helpful […] . I feel sad just because he is not accepting it. -Woman, 33 years-old, Amhara, IDI 23, L + N* In Oromia, when asked hypothetically about men's reactions to women gaining power and confidence, opinions varied:They [men] [would] feel happy because when someone who you know before, becomes above you and gains confidence [it makes you happy]. When she saves money, she is competing with you and it is important that you accept it. -Man, 32 years-old, Oromia, FGD 6, L + N* While in response another man said: Some people do not think like he said [the previous participant]. Before he commands her like a slave. When she learns this education, he thinks that he misses his power. He thinks that he does not have someone [a wife] who supports him. -Man, 30 years-old, Oromia, FGD 6, L + N* These conflicting opinions both ultimately position women's empowerment in direct competition to men's power. Men have the possibility to deal with this perceived loss of power either by accepting it or trying to reinstate it. Consistent with qualitative results, the quantitative analysis revealed that although SPIR activities led to increases in women's decisionmaking, they did not decrease husband's controlling behaviours (Table 5 , column 5). In fact, among the livelihood transfer sample, the poultry intervention that led to large increases in women's decisionmaking, also led to a marginally significant increase in husband's controlling behaviours (S4 Table A5 ).Pathway 4: improvements in gender roles and gender equitable attitudes Some evidence suggests that engaging men and women in VESA, SAA and nutrition BCC activities led to more equitable sharing of household tasks and an increase in mutual respect. For example, when asked about the changes to their relationship after the savings group training a man said: A couple of women also reported that participating in the VESA group meetings with their husbands improved the couples' relationship as it increased his respect towards her and started to view her as an equal decision-making partner: They [their husbands] are happy now [that] we can discuss financial issues with them and it creates less argument. -Woman, 30 years-old, Amhara, FGD 5, L + N*Table 5 Agency and female's input into decision-making around production. (1) (2) Some male nutrition training participants reportedly became more active in the care of their children and women appreciated this contribution: (3) (4) (5) He tells me what to feed my children, he says cook this for tonight. He is more involved … I like it. I really like it. -Woman, 33 years-old, Amhara, IDI 20, L + N* Additionally, men reported enjoying the trainings, including those that focused on gender equality as it improved their marriage: Now I am sharing some of my wife's tasks … When she bakes injera [Ethiopian bread], I fetch water or collect firewood; so, the training helped me to recognise the need to collaborate with each other for the household. -Man, 23 years-old, Amhara, IDI 7, L + N* The quantitative results support the qualitative findings; across all three treatment arms we found large increases in men's participation in household chores, in particular collecting firewood and water (Table 6 ). Impacts were especially large from T3 (L + N*), where engaging men in nutrition BCC significantly increased their involvement in cleaning and meal preparation. Although women reported they were happy with male engagement in these programmes, they stated more had to be done. Further, there was recognition that when men did engage in household tasks, community responses towards them tended to be negative: The other men may insult the one who fetches water […] his friends might say to him 'look, you are doing what women do'. -Woman, 29 years-old, Amhara, FGD 4, L*+N Quantitatively, we also found evidence that SPIR improved men's gender equitable attitudes, but there were no changes in women's attitudes (Table 7 ).Discussion This study examines pathways through which the Government of Ethiopia's public works and complementary programmes impact IPV. Using a mixed-methods approach, this paper elucidates the interplay of pathways hypothesised in Buller et al. (2018) through which these programmes affect IPV. Overall, evidence of impacts of the complementary programmes on IPV were limited, but we found quantitative and qualitative evidence in support of all three pathways in Buller et al. (2018) , as well as a fourth pathway specifically related to engaging men in the SPIR complementary programmes. There was qualitative evidence of public works (PSNP only) partially alleviating economic stress and improving wellbeing in the family (pathway 1) and decreasing daily quarrels in the household (pathway 2). For the first pathway, almost all participants reported that money from PSNP decreased poverty-related stress and the work provided purpose, though salary and work conditions were not ideal. This aligns with findings that critique public works programmes in Ethiopia and Haiti as programme beneficiaries are generally inadequately compensated for their labour (Carruth and Freeman, 2021) . For the second pathway, participants described triggers for arguments decreasing due to the income provided by PSNP. However, there were some indications that public works only could increase family tensions; women reported not having the time to complete household tasks and caring responsibilities when participating in the PSNP only programme, and men did not always respond well to women not meeting this gendered expectation. There was also no evidence of an impact of public works on women's empowerment (pathway 3). The SPIR skills and training activities provided by the nutrition and livelihood interventions and the cash and poultry transfers had a positive impact on gender relations through all three pathways, and also showed positive impacts on a fourth pathway of improving gender roles and gender equitable attitudes. Participants appreciated the VESA savings groups that allowed them to save and alleviated financial worries (pathway 1). This was corroborated quantitatively, where all three treatment arms led to women reporting savings and households accessing resources from VESA. Men's self-reported financial worry also decreased in T2 (L*+N) and T3 (L + N*), although there was no impact on depressive symptoms. Participants also gave importance to the livelihood and home gardening intervention that decreased daily arguments about money (pathway 2). Women reported becoming financially independent and more self-confident after the SPIR programme (pathway 3). This was triangulated quantitatively by a significant increase in women's financial decision-making power across all three arms. Women also reported gaining respect from their husband and the community through increased nutritional and financial knowledge. Men, however had conflicting opinions about women's empowerment, and some feared losing their own position of power in the household. This is supported quantitatively; although SPIR activities led to increases in women's decision-making, they did not lead to decreases in husband's controlling behaviours. Gender role strain theory (Pleck et al., 1995) suggests that men who perceive themselves as failing to live up to the provider role may experience negative psychological consequences and exhibit more aggression towards female partners (Moore et al., 2008) . This finding aligns with previous research that suggests that although men may be grateful for women's financial contributions to the household, they also perceive it as a threat to their masculinities that are built on their ability to provide, resulting in increased male backlash in the form of controlling behaviours (Guarnieri and Rainer, 2018) . Furthermore, SPIR improved gender roles and men's gender equitable attitudes through an additional fourth pathway (pathway 4) that relate to including men and women in gender transformative activities, In our study men reported a willingness to participate in N* trainings, with reports of improvements in household task-sharing and in prioritising nutrition, and this was appreciated by women. This was supported quantitatively across all treatment arms. Impacts were strongest in T3 (L + N*), suggesting that male engagement in the nutrition BCC led to larger participation in household chores and meal preparation resulting in increases in mutual respect. The positive impacts of the nutrition training resonates with findings from a cash and food transfer programme in Ecuador (Buller et al., 2016) . Despite our evidence showing improved men's gender equitable attitudes, qualitative reports indicate that norms at the community level were hard to shift. This aligns with research from other settings such as Indashyikirwa in Rwanda (Dunkle et al., 2020) where the training curriculum with couples was effective at reducing IPV but not at addressing community norms (Chatterji et al., 2020) . This suggests that social protection programmes with complementary activities have the potential to be gender transformative and reduce IPV at scale, but there needs to be recognition of the time it takes to adapt programmes to ensure cultural and contextual relevance and reliability. Furthermore, programmes that include organised diffusion mechanisms (e.g. 'edu'tainment) that allow messages delivered in individual groups to be shared with the wider community hold promise as complementary interventions (Francis et al., 2021) . Although we find evidence of improvements along the pathways, we find no evidence that SPIR reduced IPV among the full sample. This is consistent with other studies that show that livelihood interventions may improve emotional and economic wellbeing, but have not been shown to be effective at reducing IPV (Kerr-Wilson et al., 2020) . Further, these SPIR complementary programmes were complex and aimed at multiple outcomes without an explicit focus on IPV. Interestingly, for the sub-sample of extremely poor households, the quantitative results showed decreases in reports of sexual IPV from female recipients of T2 (L*+N) and the poultry grant. This is despite evidence that has shown that sexual IPV is usually difficult to change (Gibbs et al., 2020) . It is plausible that the poultry intervention imbedded within other SPIR activities provided women with a source of income (rearing chickens and selling eggs) and nutritious eggs for family consumption, that may have increased her husband's respect. With a decrease in daily arguments there was an improvement in relationship quality. Women may have thus developed a positive view of their sexual relationship and seen it as consensual, rather than as a forced marital obligation which is often the way it is framed in Ethiopia and other patriarchal contexts (Stern and Heise, 2018) . This aligns with findings from the Kenya GiveDirectly unconditional cash transfer trial, where female directed transfers decreased physical and sexual violence while male directed transfers only decreased physical violence (Haushofer et al., 2019) . Future research should compare modalities of women's economic strengthening programmes (e.g., public works or asset transfers) with the inclusion of complementary activities that include gender and power training ('social' empowerment) to test pathways and impacts on relationship quality and IPV. Finally, drawing on feminist literature on women's empowerment, there needs to be appreciation of this cultural context where traditional gender roles may prevail despite improvements in women's decisionmaking and empowerment in order not to increase IPV (Catherine and Jenevieve, 2016; Kabeer, 1999) . Therefore violence in the household cannot be eliminated by economic strengthening alone, and there is a need for complementary programming, such as engaging men to support women's empowerment and gender equality in gender transformative interventions.Limitations This study has some limitations. First, PSNP is a seasonal public works programme designed to provide poor, rural households with secure labour. However, with the labour requirement of five days/ month over six months, it is not intended as full-time labour, and thus impacts of this public works programme may be attenuated compared to other full-time employment. Second, different components of SPIR intervention were rolled out at different times. Some components had been implemented for a little less than a year before the interviews and may not have benefited from it long enough to result in meaningful reductions in household stress, empowerment, changes in gender norms and violent behaviours. Third, this study was conceived as a complementary mixed-methods study that was not part of the main impact evaluation. And as such, the main impact evaluation was not designed to explore mechanisms through which public works and complementary programming affect IPV. Thus, our findings must be interpreted accordingly. Given the importance of cash transfers and complementary programmes in IPV prevention, impact evaluations of such programmes should make IPV a primary focus and incorporate a mixed-methods approach from the outset. Social desirability is another possible limitation, particularly from men reporting favourably about programmes so they will continue and under-reporting violence. Finally, given the complex nature of the intervention and the treatment arms, it is difficult to disentangle the impacts of different activities on relationship quality and IPV.Conclusion This study contributes to the limited literature on the impacts of public works and complementary programmes on IPV. There was limited evidence on the direct impacts of the interventions on IPV for the full sample, but we found quantitative and qualitative evidence to support the pathways that impact on IPV. We found evidence of positive changes due to public works (PSNP) across pathway 1 (emotional wellbeing and economic security) and pathway 2 (intrahousehold conflict), with participants reporting decreases in poverty-related stress and arguments with partners and increases in emotional wellbeing. We found similar impacts from the complementary programmes (SPIR) across pathways 1 and 2, but also in pathway 3 (women's empowerment), although men had conflicting reactions to women's empowerment. We also found impact of SPIR on improving gender roles and men's gender equitable attitudes (pathway 4). The livelihood grantthat served as a source of income for poorer women -holds some promise to empower women, reduce IPV and improve the family's health, especially when embedded with other gender transformative activities such as engaging men in nutrition BCC programmes. We found some limited evidence of unintended consequences of the PSNP programme, and it is important that programme implementers and evaluators monitor these closely with appropriate mitigation measures in place. Given the increased importance of social protection in the COVID-19 response and recovery, as well as the increases in IPV due to the pandemic, this work is likely to become increasingly important.Fig. 1 . 1 Fig. 1.

This could partly be due to CT implementation dynamics and beneficiary interpersonal factors. We conducted an assessment of CT component of the DREAMS programme in Tanzania. We explored how AGYW spent their CT over time, to whom they disclosed cash receipt, and where they sought advice on CT use. The study employed qualitative research methods including: 20 longitudinal in-depth interviews (IDIs) and 60 cross-sectional IDIs with AGYW in the CT programme. Data were analysed thematically. AGYW use of CT fell into five categories: business development, survival, self-care, helping family, and savings. The primary uses of CT funds were investment in businesses and livestock for savings. AGYW use of cash changed over instalments. AGYW consulted a variety of sources when deciding on how to use the cash, primarily mothers, programme personnel, and long-term partners/ husbands. CT programmes that give cash directly to AGYW and have a strong entrepreneurial mentorship component could have implications for HIV prevention, SRH, and overall social and economic development.","Introduction As adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) in sub-Saharan Africa transition into adulthood, they are faced with a multitude of structural and interpersonal challenges, including poverty and lack of access to economic resources; gender-based violence; and limited access to education and healthcare (UNAIDS & the African Union, 2015). These challenges increase women's vulnerability to high risk sexual behaviours such as concurrency, age-disparate relationships and transactional sex, which in turn increase risk of HIV infection. Interventions that address these structural determinants are needed. Cash transfers (CT) are a structural intervention that have been widely used in low-and middleincome countries as a mechanism to alleviate poverty (Cluver, Orkin, Yakubovich, & Sherr, 2016; Dake et al., 2018; Handa et al., 2015; Palermo et al., 2017) . CT have been associated with benefits such as increased school enrolment, reduced unplanned pregnancy and a reduction in early marriage (Baird, Garfein, McIntosh, & Ozler, 2012; Cluver et al., 2013; Dake et al., 2018; Pettifor et al., 2016) . One of the key mechanisms through which CT is speculated to reduce HIV risk has been through increasing access to income which in turn reduces need to engage in transactional sex for personal needs. However, evidence on the effects of CT on reducing sexual risk behaviours, and HIV has been mixed. While some studies show a positive effect on outcomes such as reduced HIV incidence and diminished HIV risk behaviours (Baird et al., 2012) , others had no influence on HIV incidence or risk behaviour (Pettifor et al., 2016) . Evidence on impact of CT on early marriage and pregnancy is also mixed (Baird et al., 2012; Dake et al., 2018; Handa et al., 2015) . A possible explanation for the inconsistent results might be differences in context and programme design. These factors may alter whether the young woman has direct access to the cash, amount of cash, and how AGYW use the cash. Despite some evidence from South Africa on the spending of CT money among adolescent girls receiving CT conditioned on school attendance, (MacPhail et al., 2017) , little is known about how AGYW out of school, married and unmarried and receiving unconditional CT money, make decisions on spending, and how their spending decisions may change throughout the duration of the CT programme. This dearth of knowledge limits our understanding of the impact of the CTs as a structural intervention to reduce HIV risk among out-of-school AGYW. Understanding how AGYW perceive and use the money received through CT interventions has important implications for their economic empowerment and reduction of risky sexual behaviours. We present findings from a qualitative study conducted among AGYW who participated in a CT intervention which was implemented as part of the DREAMS (Determined, Resilient, Empowered, AIDS-free, Mentored, and Safe) initiative (PEPFAR et al., 2016) , a combination HIV prevention programme targeting AGYW in Tanzania. We explored participants use of cash, changes over time in their spending, and decision making on the use of cash.MethodsSauti programme This qualitative study was conducted with participants from Sauti project which was implemented as part of the DREAMS initiative, a USAID funded programme. The programme combines biomedical, behavioural, and structural intervention to address HIV among vulnerable populations, including AGYW. In particular, we focused on participants who had received one of Sauti's structural interventions, a combined CT and economic empowerment programme. The structural intervention aims to provide vulnerable AGYW with cash on a regular basis in order to reduce economic vulnerability thus enabling them to make healthier sexual decisions. Specifically, the programme aims to reduce transactional sex, relationships with older partners, concurrent partnerships, and inconsistent condom use. Programme participants received CT of TZS 70,000 ($ 31) every three months over an 18-month period. Cash was delivered via SIM cards on mobile phones provided by Sauti project. The CT was paired with WORTH+, an economic empowerment intervention which included financial literacy education, individual and group savings and loan, and entrepreneurship skills. To be eligible for the CT and WORTH+ programme, participants had to be: female; between the ages of 15 and 23; resident of the intervention villages; out of school; completed 10 h of behaviour change communication (BCC); and, willing and able to give voluntary, informed consent/assent to all study procedures including HIV and HSV-2 testing and receive test result. Participants under age 18 required the consent of a guardian unless they met criteria for emancipated minors.Data collection We recruited participants (n = 60) from Sauti sites in the Shinyanga region of Northwest Tanzania, including Bulungwa (rural), Kahama (peri-urban), and Shinyanga municipal (urban). Shinyanga is a primarily agricultural area and among the poorest regions of Tanzania. We conducted longitudinal in-depth interviews (n = 20), cross sectional in-depth interviews at endline (n = 40). Longitudinal interviews (n = 20) were conducted to examine patterns of CT use and their impact over a one-year period. Participants were interviewed in June 2017 just after the first round of CT, then again in June 2018 after participants had received three or four payments. Longitudinal interviews were conducted with participants from Shinyanga municipal since the CT intervention was launched in this region first. Cross-sectional interviews (n = 40) were conducted in June 2018 in all three recruitment areas. Interviews broadly assessed how participants spent their CT, to whom they disclosed cash receipt, how these people reacted to the programme and any advice they provided. All interviews with AGYW were conducted in Kiswahili by trained female research assistants. Individual interviews were conducted in private locations at the social service organisations implementing Sauti and near the homes of some participants. Participants were compensated TZS 5,000 ($2) for transportation costs to the interview. We obtained IRB approval from the National Institute for Medical Research in Tanzania and the University of North Carolina. Informed consent was obtained prior to any interview.Analyses All interviews were transcribed verbatim in Kiswahili, and then translated into English. Six researchers coded transcripts using Dedoose, an online qualitative software. We used applied thematic analysis to analyse interviews. For quality control, one transcript from each interview type was coded by all researchers, and then coding consistency was compared across researchers. Upon reaching consensus and modifying code definitions, interviews were coded by multiple researchers. Approximately 20% of the rest of the transcripts were quality checked for coding. Researchers would take notes on any discrepancies in coding found, and then share with the group in team meetings. After coding was complete, created matrices summarising major topical areas including: participants use of cash, changes over time in their spending, and decision making on the use of cash. We reviewed matrices to identify patterns within and across interviews.ResultsHow AGYW used the cash transfer money We noted five primary categories of how participants used the CT money received: survival, self-care, helping family members, business development and savings. Relative amounts of investment by participants varied by a number of different demographic factors, including family support, age, marital status, and residence (urban and rural). Participant's family economic status determined business investment. Families with higher economic status often invested in AGYW's business while in lower income families, AGYW had to provide support instead. In as much as the majority of participants appreciated being in the CT programme, they preferred the amount of cash to be higher than what they were currently receiving. They also expressed a desire for the CT programme to be continuous in order for them to sustain the different investment activities they had started. We present the spending patterns in detail below.Survival Most young women mentioned spending at least some of their money on basic survival items such as food, for themselves and their family. Other survival expenses for self and family included medical expenses and on rare occasions rent. These expenses were not uncommon at each transfer, but infrequently were mentioned as the primary use of the cash, especially among the married young women. One participant explained how the money helped with food: Maybe there is no food. They [family] can ask you for money to buy food. If I have money, I buy, and we eat. [17-year-old girl, single, urban] Another participant explained how it helped with housing: I received 70,000 through those phones from Sauti. After I received that money, I thanked God. It helped me … house rent was due. So, I paid for two months. [19-year-old young woman, married, urban]Self-care Most participants, especially the older unmarried women, mentioned spending portions of the CT on self-care. Self-care involved the purchase of basic personal items as well as taking care of the needs of their children. The bulk of these personal items included soaps, lotions, body oils, and sanitary pads for themselves, and some bought shoes or clothing for themselves or their child. When I received that money, I bought clothes, sanitary pads, or other important things. [18-year-old girl, single, rural] Helping family members A number of CT recipients mentioned giving some or all of the money received to a family member or husband. The funds AGYW provided were generally intended for food for the family, contributing to a family business or farming expenses, and emergencies. Many AGYW saw it as their duty to help support their family as this was the first time, they had access to money and could contribute financially. One participant explained in regards to food: After I joined the project, mum sometimes asks for money from me to buy stuff from the market … .to buy sardines and tomatoes … I even buy meat for them … I started buying just after I started receiving money, because I thought since had some money, I could help them too … [16-year-old girl single, rural] A few supported other family needs such as supporting siblings' education by buying school supplies and paying fees. A participant explained in regards to furthering the education of a sibling. The first phase I gave the money to my sibling who was going to school … I gave her/him the entire TZS 70,000. [24-year-old young woman, single, urban]Business development Almost all young women participating in the CT programme used some of the money for economic development and the most commonly stated primary uses included investment in a personal business and/or purchase of livestock. Common businesses they invested in were: selling powdered soap, clothes, farm produce, cooked food, raising livestock for sale, and tailoring. Those with pre-existing businesses generally added to the capital to expand or diversify their product. Those new to business generally started an enterprise that aligned with Sauti-offered entrepreneurship trainings, invested and participated in a family business, or invested in livestock. A participant new to business explained: … I used the money to start a business for food vending … I didn't buy everything … but started by buying things like tables, those are a must to have. … . I started my business with TZS 50,000 ($24). [23-year-old young woman, single, urban] Most of the participants who invested in livestock were mainly from the rural setting. Livestock served a dual purpose as entrepreneurial venture to expand and sell animals, and as a form of savings to liquidate later and invest in another venture. One participant explained this investment: ""When I received the cash, I withdrew and went to buy three goats … My plans are that later those goats will grow and reproduce."" [21-year-old, young woman, single, urban] Savings Almost all AGYW talked about saving some of the cash from the programme or profits from businesses started with the programme money. Participants mentioned numerous avenues to save money, including mobile money stored on phones (M-pesa and Tigo pesa), livestock (e.g. goats, chickens), a box at home (piggy bank), relatives holding onto their money (especially mothers), and savings groups. The most commonly reported saving mechanism was through saving groups. Saving groups contained 20 or more members and required minimal weekly deposits with optional supplemental deposits. These saving groups provided loans with a small interest rate to enable members expand businesses or cover emergency situations in their lives. One participant commented on planned use of savings: I have plans with my savings in the group. Once we dissolve the group, I will give the money to mother, so that she can add to it what she has and buy the sewing machine that she wants to buy for me … in the group I have TZS 50,000 ($24), but the sewing machine is TZS 200,000 ($96) [18-year-old girl, single, rural]. Many participants viewed savings groups as secure mechanism through which to build capital and access social support as well as share business ideas. Rather than being tempted to spend or give cash saved at home, money saved in a group was accessible only at certain times and with the knowledge of the group. One participant explained Saving groups also served as insurance for emergencies. AGYW mentioned that they borrowed money for emergencies such as sickness and bereavement. A young woman who was encouraged to join a saving group for this reason reported: Before joining the CT programme, I did not have a group. Then I got to join one where we help each other in times of sickness and during hard times [24-year-old young woman, single, urban]Changes in how AGYW used cash transfers over time The patterns of CT use changed over instalments. Some AGYW mentioned survival and self-care as the primary uses of their first CT; however, in later instalments this number decreased as most focused on economic development. Honestly, when I received my first cash, that first instalment, I did not invest in business. I bought clothes and food. The second round I used the money to start a business of selling bed sheets. I used the third instalment on farming, but also bought more chickens. I only had two chickens, so when I received, I added more chickens. [16-year-old girl, single, urban] Everyday demands and challenges interfered with how participants used the CT money. Many talked about being compelled to redirect the money they had invested in business to help with family issues such as illness of family member or their own child. Additionally, events such as the arrival of a child altered the plans girls had for the CT money. One participant explained: I invested in my clothing business but after having my child I used all that money … Before I could just spend the money on my clothes, shoes, inner wear but now that I have a child, I have to at least buy him soap [19-yearold young woman, single, urban] While business expenses and livestock were the two biggest investments at the first instalment, the number of participants listing business as their primary use of cash increased at each instalment. One participant explained her experience with this change over time: I used the first and second round of cash with no reasonable target … but I realized that the way I was using money whenever I got it, I would be broke, … . I decided to do something profitable … that will increase my income. [18-year-old girl, single, urban] Changes in business activities Some participants grew a primary business at each transfer by pooling profits from previous CT investments with new CT. In some instances, participants would initially sell from home or rent space and materials necessary to support their business. As their business capital increased these participants would buy needed materials and rent space in a more prominent area. As one participant explained: I used it to start a business. I opened a restaurant at home for cooking food … To increase the money, to have my own money. After receiving the second instalment, I left home, I looked for a room for selling my food there"". [18-year-old, single girl, urban] For some participants meeting long term business goals proved challenging. These young women reported not finding a market for their sale items, livestock dying from disease or poisoning, customers buying on credit and not repaying, and consuming produce intended for sale. AGYW were careful not to operate at a loss, and in response to these business difficulties many reported changing businesses. One participant explained in response to inquiry: … In the shoe and soap business, people delayed paying their debts and sometimes they totally didn't pay. The challenge was big! I saw it was better to pull-up myself from another perspective by deciding to buy chicken, because chicken would not challenge me so much as it was with soap [18-year-old, single girl, urban] Distribution of cash within personal businesses changed over time as well. Some participants diversified businesses, observed market trends, then focused efforts on the enterprise with the most profit potential at any given time. A young woman talked about how she had moved from one business to another: At first, I sold the goats I had bought using the second CT. Thereafter, I withdrew [from the phone] cash for the third CT and used the money to buy bags of rice. I have stored the rice … waiting for the market price to increase so as to sell it. [18-year-old, single girl, rural] Decision making on the use of cash In addition to individual decision making, majority of AGYW also consulted a variety of sources when deciding how to spend money received through the programme. Most AGYW noted numerous individuals that influenced or advised them on how to use the cash. Most notable among these influencers included mothers, longer term or more serious partners/husbands, and Sauti project personnel.Making financial decisions with parents The younger women consulted mothers on financial management and business ideas more than the older ones. Therefore, the businesses they invested in seemed to be heavily determined by their mothers. In addition to helping with decision making on how to use the cash, some mothers also supported the AGYW by adding to the CT money to support business development. A 16-yearold talked about her experience in the following: My mother is the one who gave me more money because the price for tomatoes had gone up … She added me TZS 10,000 ($4). My parents give me ideas. When I share my plan about what I want to do such as to buy livestock … dad will help me. [16-year-old girl, single, urban] Adolescents who were single and did not have prior entrepreneurial skills relied heavily on parental advice regarding how to spend the money. Many unmarried AGYW preferred to disclose their involvement in the CT programme to family members rather than sexual partners. They talked about trusting and confiding in their mothers most for almost all matters in their lives including their participation in the CT programme. My mother is the most important person to me because she means everything to me … I cannot do anything without involving my mother, even when I wanted to join the CT project, I went and told her first and she advised me to join. [17-year-old girl, single, urban] Most AGYW reflected on the usefulness of the advice they received from their mothers and said that without consulting them, they would have misused the money by spending it on non-income earning items such as clothing: I feel that had it not been for my mum's advice, I think I would have misused the money … . I would have bought clothes and the money would have gone to waste. It is good that I involved mother. [18-year-old girl, single, rural] Making financial decisions with partners The majority of the married AGYW disclosed their involvement in the CT programme to their spouses who sometimes helped them make decisions on how the cash should be used. Husband's advice was mainly in favour of the cash being used for the general development of the family. A married woman described how her partner had been supportive but also controlling in the following: On the contrary, unmarried AGYW seldom disclosed receipt of CT to casual and non-serious partners. These participants thought their partners would take money from them, control their money, and stop giving them money often through transactional sex. One participant explained: As for me, I felt that if I told him that I am in CT project, he would not have helped me when I had a problem and asked him for money. I felt that he wouldn't really listen to my problem if he knew I was receiving the cash. Single, urban] The influence of the programme on the use of CT Sauti project personnel had a large influence on young women's use of cash. Through regular entrepreneurial and financial training sessions, the intervention messaging on how to spend CT money and the need to save through savings groups enhanced AGYW's decision-making ability and cash management skills. AGYW recounted advice from the programme trainers on investing their money in something that could generate profits rather than consumables. A 17-year-old girl reported: They advised us that we should do business so that we can be getting profit … It is good that they advised us to do business … We are now doing well … Our lives have become better. [17-year-old girl, single, urban] Another participant reflected on a message recalled from the training sessions on the use of cash for investment in business. When we went to the session the teacher gave us constructive ideas, that ""you need to make progress because this money is meant to facilitate your development, it's not intended to be spent on your clothes or shoes, because it will be useless"". [22-year-old young woman, married, urban]Discussion This study provides insights into spending patterns and decision making on spending by AGYW enrolled in a CT intervention. AGYW demonstrated interest in improving their economic situation by investing in income-generating businesses with CT funds. The use of the CT was influenced by AGYW's family context and baseline levels of poverty, prior business experience and CT programme messaging. AGYW's decision on how to use the cash for business development were sometimes determined by factors such as: previous experience doing business, parental advice, husband support, immediate family economic need and the occurrence of life events such as sudden illness. While many of the younger women struggled to decide what business activity to invest their CT money, this was not entirely the case for the older participants with prior entrepreneurial skills. AGYW's consultation of parents, other family members and CT programme implementers for decision making on how to use the cash, suggests that they could benefit from formal mentorship. Despite concerns that parents would take and spend the money in ways that might not benefit AGYW, there are calls for mentorship to accompany financial interventions with young populations in Tanzania (Balvanz et al., 2018) . Mentorship can help direct AGYW on how to save or invest the money in an informed manner, including saving to promote resiliency in the face of adversities such as fluctuations in market prices, failed farm produce and customers who default on repayments of items taken on credit. It is apparent from our findings that AGYW need to spend some money on basic-personal needs but over time they can develop business to generate income for these needs and more. We observed that the structure and amount of transfers impacted development over time with many showing improved business management skills through subsequent rounds of CTs. The variations in AGYW's use of cash by instalments could point to their flexibility and sensitivity to market situations and fluctuations. The changes in use of cash from survival and self-care in their first cash instalments to more income generation activities in later instalments is a sign that once AGYW are helped to cater for their immediate basic needs, they are willing to invest in a system that ensures them regular income. Cash enhanced AGYW financial stability enabling AGYW to participate in social and economic savings groups. The discussions in the savings groups permitted for the exchange of ideas and allowed for interpersonal support especially on how to use the cash. Saving groups also offered a safety net in emergencies such as sudden illness, or death of a close family member therefore reducing AGYW's experience of stress. Saving groups could have implications for the success of CT programmes that directly give the cash to AGYW. There is need for CT programmes to encourage recipients to form social support groups that could act as insurance in times of need. This CT programme studied here differs from others in that the lump-sum amount of cash was directly given to AGYW at an interval of three months, and AGYW were mentored on wise spending and left to make their own decisions on how to spend. This strategy allowed AGYW access large sums of their own cash. Other CT programmes in Tanzania such as the government's productive Safety Social Net and elsewhere have mainly given cash to caregivers for vulnerable households and expected them to spend the cash in a manner that would benefit all in the household including AGYW (Handa et al., 2017; Pettifor et al., 2013) . Although studies have shown that CT given to caregivers (especially female caregivers) improved child outcomes (Cluver et al., 2013) , the effects could be even greater when the cash is given to both the adolescents and caregivers (Baird et al., 2012) . Our results point to many benefits to AGYW if they are given CT money directly. Evidence shows that the needs and wants of AGYW might differ from what parents/caregivers might consider important and be willing to provide for them, thus leading AGYW to engage in risky sexual behaviour such as transactional sex, multiple partners to able to meet their needs (Babalola, Tambashe, & Vondrasek, 2005; Baird et al., 2012; Bhana & Pattman, 2011; Cluver, Orkin, Boyes, Gardner, & Meinck, 2011; Leclerc-Madlala, 2003; Wamoyi, Wight, Plummer, Mshana, & Ross, 2010; Zembe, Townsend, Thorson, & Ekstrom, 2013) . We recommend further research to understand the variations in effect if cash is given to both AGYW versus just parents or AGYW in the same setting. There is also need to explore the sustainability of the benefits reported by AGYW after the conclusion of the CT programme. The everyday challenges in AGYW's lives interfered with some investment plans which limited achievement of business goals and overall benefits from the CT. Challenges such as livestock dying and businesses not doing well could indicate that the programme was positive but not sufficient, and additional linkages/services are needed, such as linkages to agricultural extension workers who can teach people buying livestock about caring for them as well as proper entrepreneurial mentorship. While on one hand we had participants who needed to help their families with basic needs, on the contrary, there were those who received additional cash from parents for their business. As many encountered emergencies such as illness and siblings school fees, they were forced to redirect their resources, leading to deterioration of business and less financial returns (Dunbar et al., 2010) . We speculate that the lack of effects on some health outcomes in previous CT programmes could be explained by how the money was spent by the beneficiaries (Baird et al., 2012; Cluver et al., 2011; Handa et al., 2015) . CT programmes should encourage AGYW to have a backup plan to fall back to during emergencies. Failure to do this could mean that the full benefits of CT given to AGYW directly may not have the desired impact. Similar to findings from other CT interventions in Tanzania (Palermo et al., 2017) , this programme seemed to have reduced poverty experienced by AGYW as indicated in their mention that they could now afford things that that they could not previously buy without the CT intervention. Similar to what was observed in other CT studies, (Baird et al., 2012; Handa et al., 2015) , our findings show that the CT helped address the economic drivers of risk as AGYW talked about CT funds and savings for survival needs and emergencies. In many low-income household families, AGYW have been expected to contribute to household needs as it is not always feasible for parents to provide for all basic needs. Previous work points to adolescent supporting such families through money earned as a result of engaging in transactional sex (Wamoyi et al., 2010; Wight et al., 2006) . As indicated in our findings, AGYW are still supporting their families' economic needs, but mainly through CT programme money and less from their engagement in transactional sex. AGYW's concern with domestic affairs and support of other household members using their CT has also been noted in another study in South Africa (Khoza et al., 2018) . AGYW access to their own cash could have implications for their sexual and reproductive health (SRH). As noted in other studies from Tanzania AGYW were motivated to engage in premarital sex to afford survival items (Maganja, Maman, Groves, & Mbwambo, 2007; Wamoyi et al., 2010) . In another paper from this study (Pettifor, Wamoyi, Balvanz, Gichane, & M, 2019) , we observed that AGYW reported reduced risky sexual behaviour such as transactional sex and number of partners as a result of their engagement in the CT programme. Transactional sex is associated with increased risk of HIV among women (Kilburn et al., 2018; Wamoyi, Stobeanau, Bobrova, Abramsky, & Watts, 2016) and therefore, CT interventions that address the economic vulnerability of AGYW are likely to reduce their engagement in transactional sex and ultimately reduce their risk for HIV infection. Similar to any research, this study had limitations. This was a qualitative study with limited generalisability. Participants provided self-reports on how the CT was used, thus there is potential desirability bias in their reports of spending patterns. Participants were recruited from an ongoing intervention, the Sauti programme that had a strong financial management component and emphasised the need for AGYW to spend the CT on business and development goals. The other limitation in terms of sample is that these interviews were conducted among the women who stayed in the CT programmethese may have been more successful in their business ventures compared to those who dropped out.Conclusion The CT programme giving cash directly to AGYW as opposed to through parents/caregiver could be a better strategy as it gives them access to their own cash and income allowing them to spend on personal-basic needs as well as investment in business activities. AGYW's decision on how to spend the cash was very much influenced by parents and messaging from the CT programme. Further research should explore the progress and sustainability of the business investments by the AGYW post the CT programme. AGYW's CT programmes that have a strong entrepreneurial mentorship component could have implications for HIV prevention as well as other SRH benefits and overall social and economic development.He [husband] would help me weigh my priorities and advise me on what I should give more priority to, if I have money, he would top it up and advise me on what to do with it"" … ""but he is also very strict.

BMC Family Practice, 20(1), [137].","Introduction Increased obesity rates and decreased physical activity levels are strongly linked with increased prevalence and incidence of diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2) [1, 2] . In the Netherlands, a so called 'care group' (a legal entity that is part of the primary care sector) has the responsibility to arrange and to contract all care for DM2 and cardiovascular disease (CVD) patients as prescribed through the Dutch Health Care Standards [3] . There are over 100 care groups in the Netherlands, which all operate in a specific region. A care group receives a fixed amount of money per patient from the health care insurer and has to contract all health care providers, such as general practitioners, needed to deliver the necessary care [3] . This fixed amount per patient is supposed to constitute an incentive for the care group to invest in prevention. By investing in prevention, the health status of patients might improve which can contribute to less intensive care a patient needs and fewer consults for example. Implementing combined lifestyle interventions (CLI) are such a form of prevention. A CLI is an intervention that aims to help patients change their lifestyle in a healthy way and to maintain this new healthy lifestyle. During a CLI, patients are supported by healthcare professionals to create a healthy lifestyle and to get tools to adhere to this healthy lifestyle. A CLI consists of advice and counseling to improve health related-behaviors as physical activity and eating habits. Lack of physical activity is associated with a less favorable progress in DM2 disease course and an increase in all-cause mortality rates [4] . Moreover, patients already diagnosed with DM2 or CVD have a high prevalence of physical inactivity [5] . Hence, lifestyle interventions including attention for physical activity are being implemented to prevent DM2 in high-risk patients and favorably influence the course of disease in DM2 patients. These interventions seem to be at least as effective as pharmacological interventions and reduced the risk of developing diabetes in people with impaired glucose tolerance by about 50% [1] . A CLI aims to improve health-related behavior such as physical activity and diet. By adapting healthy lifestyle habits, complications or worsening of DM2 and/or CVD might be prevented, postponed or even reversed [4, 6] . Effective CLIs will result in increased quality of life for patients and lower medical costs. However, successful implementation of these interventions poses a challenge, since participation rates tend to be low [7, 8] . Reasons for low participation rates might be lack of time, costs of participating or transport issues [9] . Searching for ways to improve participation rates and adherence to prescribed lifestyle interventions, health promoting financial incentives (HPFIs) are implemented as addition to the CLI. HPFIs are cash or cash-like rewards or fines provided contingent on (non-)performance of healthy behaviors [10] . Besides the two main categories of positive (e.g. reward or discount) or negative (e.g. a fine or higher out of pocket costs) financial incentives, there is great variation in characteristics of an HPFI. Saving campaigns or deposit contracts are also a form of a HPFI. Saving campaigns in general, like collecting loyalty points for free products, are popular in the Netherlands. A deposit contract means that participants of a CLI pay a certain amount of money to participate, and by meeting prerequisites that are determined at the start of the CLI they can get a part of the amount of the whole amount of the deposit back. The effectiveness of HPFIs added to a CLI on for example participation rates or program adherence is not proven yet. Only a few studies had a good study design and besides some short-term effect, no long-term effects were found [11] . HPFIs are not implemented frequently in the primary care setting in the Netherlands, but there is increasing interest in implementation of HPFIs. For a successful implementation process, it is necessary to have more elaborate knowledge on what the opinions of the stakeholders are. This descriptive qualitative study shows barriers and facilitators in the implementation of a CLI in care groups for patients with DM2 or CVD, as perceived by the stakeholders, with special attention for the supposed influence of adding a HPFI to the CLI on the implementation process [12] .MethodsImplementation process CLI and HPFI Originally, our study aimed to investigate the (cost) effectiveness of adding a HPFI to a CLI. However, despite great effort within the participating care group to create support for the CLI, and extensive research beforehand on the preferences of the target population regarding optimal characteristics of the HPFI [13] , the implementation process of this specific CLI hampered and the number of patients willing and able to participate was too low to start the CLI. As a consequence, the effect evaluation and the cost effectiveness study of that particular CLI was cancelled. Instead we executed a more elaborate and broader process evaluation of CLIs in general in order to learn more on the implementation process of a CLI and the feasibility of implementing a HPFI.Design and procedures A qualitative research design with semi-structured interviews was used to investigate the opinions of professionals involved in six Dutch care groups offering a CLI. This selection of care groups consisted of the particular care group that planned to implement the CLI and a HPFI and did not succeed and five other care groups. General practitioners, practice nurses, representatives of management of the care groups, as well as community health services policy staff related to these care groups were interviewed about barriers and facilitators for implementation of CLIs in primary care for patients with DM2 and/or CVD and about the possibility of complementing these CLIs with a HPFI. The research proposal was reviewed and approved by the Ethical Review Board of the Tilburg University before executing the study.Respondents Care groups eligible for this study had to offer a CLI to patients with DM2 and/or CVD. This intervention had to include both a diet and physical activity component. One researcher (StS) viewed the websites of 94 care groups in the Netherlands and identified twelve care groups that fulfilled these criteria. These care groups differed in size and region. The smallest care group included 11 general practitioners, whereas the largest care group included more than 200 general practitioners. In general, these 12 care groups were mostly located in the southern and western parts of the Netherlands. In total, six care groups were included in this study. Besides the care group that planned to implement the CLI and HPFI, a purposive sample of five care groups was taken out of the twelve other care groups identified to be eligible and proven to be willing to participate. This resulted in six care groups in total that varied in size. Potential respondents were invited to participate in the study via email. If no response by email was received, they were contacted by telephone. In total 24 interviews (at least 3 persons per care group) were conducted with care group managers, general practitioners, practice nurses, community health services policy staff related to the care groups and one manager of a health care insurer. Table 1 shows the respondents for each of the six care groups.Research questions The interview guide (Additional file 1) was set up to provide information with regard to following research questions: What are preferred characteristics of a CLI and factors expected to influence implementation of a CLI according to the respondents? What are preconditions for successful implementation of a CLI? What are preferred characteristics and the expected effect of HPFIs when added to a CLI according to the respondents? What is the attitude of the respondents towards HPFIs in relation to a CLI?Data collection Semi-structured interviews were conducted mostly faceto-face and some by telephone. Data collection took place between March and October 2017. An interview guide was used to discuss the barriers, facilitators and experiences with implementation of a CLI, the role HPFIs can play, opinions with regard to the content and effectiveness of HPFIs and the expectations for the future with regard to CLIs and HPFIs for patients with DM2 and CVD in primary care. Before the start of the interview, respondents signed a written informed consent, agreeing to participate in the study and to the audio recording of the interview. The interviews were held in private, so the respondent could speak freely. The interviews lasted between 30 to 60 min, were transcribed verbatim and were rendered anonymous so that they could not be traced to the respondents. The two interviews were performed by both CM and StS to determine how the design of the interview guide worked out in practice. We did not make adjustments to the interview guide. Researchers StS and TdV performed the following interviews individually. Both interviewers did not have work-related contact with the interviewees and were independent. In this way, we have done our best to ensure respondents would not give social desirable answers. After 24 interviews, no new results were identified and therefore we believe we reached data saturation and stopped the inclusion of care groups for the study.Data analysis The interviews were analyzed using a thematic approach with support of the software program MAXQDA 2018. The focus of the thematic content analysis is coding and analyzing the interviews with regard to themes [14, 15] . First, a more inductive approach was chosen and pieces of text were marked and received summarizing terms like, ""long-term vision"" or ""opinion with regard to financial incentives"" [15] . This process of open coding resulted in a list of codes. Secondly, the codes from phase 1 were ordered, deleted or merged with other codes by using axial coding. Moreover, codes were clustered and a distinction was made between main and sub codes, which resulted in a code tree with main codes like, ""barriers for implementation"" and sub codes like ""lack of time"", """" and ""funding"". Thirdly, the categories were structured and the most important categories were determined by using selective coding (Appendix 1). Three researchers (StS, CM, WWV) worked independently to analyze data and formed pairs to gain consensus and to guarantee the credibility. If no consensus was achieved, a third researcher (WWV and LvdG) was consulted to reach a final decision.Results First, the preferred characteristics of a CLI, factors expected to influence implementation of a CLI and preconditions for successful implementation of a CLI are presented. Second, insights are given with respect to preferred characteristics of HPFIs, expected effects of HPFIs when added to a CLI and the attitude of respondents towards HPFIs.Combined lifestyle interventions (CLIs) Preferred characteristics of CLI Easy accessibility of the intervention site, in other words being close to home and the content of the CLI is appropriate A more practical difficulty that was mentioned is that not all participants can be expected to be available at the same moment for the sessions. Quote 1: ""We see that the group process and pressure motivates people to exercise, but also to get in touch with others and share information about diabetes or other conditions."" A facilitating factor mentioned in the more medical context was the presence of health care professionals during sessions of the CLI. For example, respondents anticipated that DM2 patients might find it a comforting idea that if they get hypoglycemia during physical activity, a health care professional is present to give medical care or advice. Respondents also mentioned that the CLI has to fit to the needs of the target group. For example patients with low health literacy or speaking a foreign language as their native language should be supervised by someone who talks slow and simple language so the patients are able to understand the information given to them. Moreover, the content of the CLI has to fit to the perspective of the patient on what he or she believes is important to improve with regard to their health status and/or health behavior. In general, respondents were concerned about patients not being able to continue with behavioral change achieved within a CLI after the intervention was finished. An important facilitator in this respect was creating a good transition to regular sports clubs and facilities; i.e. outside of the health care sector. Many respondents had an opinion on out of pocket costs for the patients, but the opinions of were not univocal. Part of them mentioned out of pocket costs for the patients as a facilitator for participation because it creates motivation for attending sessions and finishing the program. In addition, they expected patients to make a more well-considered decision whether or not to participate in a CLI. On the other hand, a similar number of respondents stated that out of pocket costs might be a barrier for participation, especially for patients with a low budget. Quote 2: ""What I actually think, out-of-pocket costs can also stimulate. If you choose to do it and you pay for it, you also have more inclination to go for it. If it is all noncommittal, you tend to be less concerned with it, that is the way in which people think. I do not think everything just has to be for free.""Factors expected to influence implementation of CLI A facilitating factor that respondents marked as important was that health care professionals know which CLIs are available to offer their patients. Such knowledge, they indicated, is not always present. Another related facilitating factor mentioned was that referral to a CLI is easier if associated health care professionals know each other and already cooperate in a broader sense. Moreover, word of mouth promotion by the participants themselves could also facilitate implementation of a CLI. Respondents pointed out that successful recruitment of participants for the CLI is important. Factors that were mentioned to possibly facilitate recruitment were a recruitment strategy adjusted to the goals of the target group, and personal contact between health care professional and patients. About three quarters of the respondents mentioned that enthusiasm and willingness among health care professionals is very important. Enthusiastic health care professionals tend to propagate successes of the CLI and they tend to take a more active role in identifying eligible patients and offering the CLI to them. Willingness to invest in implementing a CLI and invest time to convince patients to participate in a CLI is important for successful implementation. In addition, timing constituted an important facilitating factor according to the respondents. For example, short after diagnosis of DM2, patients are more prone to participate in a CLI. Quote 3: ""I have already noticed in this course, that you are very dependent on the practice nurse and the general practitioner who is in agreement with the patients. And if the practice nurse or general practitioner does not believe in the program or only sees obstacles, they are less motivated to motivate the patients. I saw the effect."" Over half of the respondents mentioned lack of (longterm) funding as an important barrier for implementation. In general, respondents felt that health care insurers are not very keen on financing a CLI or another form of prevention programs. If funding was available most of the time it was temporarily. In this case they experienced that when funding stopped, the CLI also stopped. Other factors mentioned are lack of ownership and lack of time. According to almost all respondents, a barrier for implementation for a CLI is that health care professionals don not always tend to consider themselves responsible for offering a CLI and they state a lack of time to present it to their patients. At the same time, a few respondents mentioned that practice nurses are more willing than GPs to implement a CLI in their practice even though lack of time is also an important barrier for them. Another barrier that was mentioned was that CLIs often are not tailored to hard-to-reach groups, such as (female) immigrants who do not speak the Dutch language or patients who only visit the GP practice once a year. About half of the respondents also pointed out that in some cases health care professionals tend to decide beforehand which patients they believe do not want to participate in a CLI for multiple reasons, resulting in nonreferral. They all agreed this is not desirable. Low or no inflow of participants was also mentioned as a barrier for implementation. Patient-related factors that were identified were lack of motivation to put effort in their own health and lack of time. Two respondents suggested a quite radical change of the integrated care program to support the implementation of a CLI. Instead of having a care program aiming at managing one particular disease such as DM2 or CVD, which is the current situation in the Netherlands, they suggested a mandatory prevention program initiated by health care professionals aiming to prevent chronic disease from a healthy lifestyle perspective. This prevention program should not have a single disease focus like the programs that are nowadays applicable in primary care in the Netherlands.Preconditions for successful implementation of CLI When explicitly asked, the health care professionals suggested several essential preconditions for successful implementation of a CLI. The following preconditions are sorted by mentioned most to mentioned least: Funding which has to be arranged and clear beforehand. The CLI has to fit the needs of the target group. This might demand a custom-made program per participant. Incorporating proven effective elements in a wellconsidered plan for the content of a CLI. A good infrastructure and communication between all stakeholders. Motivated and enthusiastic health care professionals, as well as constructive collaboration between all different health care professionals. A tailored recruitment strategy resulting in a continuous inflow of eligible participants.Health promoting financial incentives (HPFIs) Preferred characteristics of HPFIs Overall, positive HPFIs were preferred over negative HPFIs. Respondents expected negative HPFIs (e.g. pay a fine or other extra costs) to raise aversion with the patients resulting in them choosing not to participate in the CLI at all. Especially for patients with a low budget they expected this fine or extra costs to be a large threshold. Quote 4: ""That punishment does not seem the solution to me. I mean, if you tell me: 'if you do not come, you have to pay a fine'. Then I say: 'well, I will not participate at all"". Respondents suggested several forms of positive HPFIs, such as a discount on their health insurance fee, participating in a CLI without costs, saving campaigns, deposit contracts and discounts on or freely available fruit and vegetables, or free sports materials. Some of the respondents suggested that the positive HPFI should not be given at the end of a program, but divided over times in small steps. Saving campaigns (e.g. loyalty points for free products) were particularly mentioned, because this type of HPFI is already familiar to most people and they expected long-term effects when a HPFI would link with systems and processes already effectively implemented in the daily lives of people. Deposit contracts were also among the frequently mentioned preferred characteristics of HPFIs. In this case, patients pay to participate in a CLI and could regain (a part of) the amount paid for example by attending all appointments.Expected effects of HPFIs About half of the respondents mentioned that adding a positive HPFI to a CLI could potentially break down barriers for patients to enroll in a CLI and even positively influence the amount of participants finishing the program. Majority of the respondents touched on the discussion whether an extrinsic motivator such as a HPFI could be the key to building intrinsic motivation for behavioral change. By breaking down the barriers to participate, enrolled patients might experience the effects of more exercise and healthy nutrition on their health. As a consequence of feeling better, they may continue the program or their adapted behavior. However, in general the respondents did not expect HPFIs to generate long-term effects. They expected most patients to revert to their old habits after completing a CLI, despite the HPFI. They suggested a continuous stimulant in the form of a HPFI or regular checks by a health care professional to prevent relapse. Specifically for patients with a low budget, they thought it would be helpful if the HPFI could take the form of a fully reimbursed program. Quotes 5 and 6: ""Well, I think motivation can be bought."" ""No, I do not believe in financial incentives. I think that the only effective incentive is a social one.""Attitude towards HPFIs Overall, the attitude of the respondents with regard to adding a HPFI to a CLI diverged. Most respondents preferred participants in a CLI who have intrinsic motivation to participate, instead of participants who only participate in the CLI because they get a reward. There were also some respondents with a more positive attitude towards adding a HPFI to a CLI. They mentioned that they believed that patients would appreciate the reward for their efforts. With regard to future implementation of HPFIs, respondents had different opinions. Part of them was convinced that it is more important to have an easy accessible CLI than to extrinsically motivate patients with a HPFI. Feasible forms of HPFIs mentioned were discount on the health care insurance or it could be that patients were exempted for paying out of pocket costs to participate in a CLI. In their opinion, collaboration with employers, industry and stores might help to fund HPFIs on a broader scale.Discussion In this study, we have evaluated perceived barriers and facilitators associated with the process of implementation of a CLI in primary care for patients with DM2 or CVD, the preferred characteristics of both a CLI and HPFI, with special attention for the influence of adding a HPFI to the CLI on the implementation process. To this aim, we interviewed health care professionals and other stakeholders from six care groups, such as a care group manager and a manager of a health care insurance company. Preferred characteristics of the CLI, according to our respondents were easy accessibility, the presence of health care professionals during for example exercise sessions, content of the CLI fitted to what the patient believes is important to improve with regard to their health status and health behavior. Opinions were not univocal for out of pocket costs and a structure of the CLI with group consults. Factors promoting the implementation of a CLI according to the respondents were often related to attitude and behavior of health care professionals. Perceived facilitating factors mentioned were enthusiastic health care professionals, knowledge with regard to the CLI, and health care professionals involved in the CLI already knowing each other and cooperating in a broader sense. Preconditions for a successful implementation of a CLI mentioned were structural funding, good infrastructure and communication between stakeholders, the CLI being tailored to the needs of the target group, motivated health care professionals and a tailored recruitment strategy. As to the HPFIs, respondents preferred positive HPFIs to negative HPFIs and generally agreed that adding a HPFI to a CLI could potentially break down barriers for patients to enroll in a CLI. A focus group study including the general public also showed that positive HPFIs are preferred [16] . They also expected it might have a positive influence on the degree of actual participation in the CLI and possibly even finishing the program. However, the respondents also questioned if an extrinsic motivator could be the key to achieve long-term behavioral change. Longterm effects of HPFIs were not expected. A lack of time of the health care professionals was mentioned as a perceived barrier to offer CLIs to the patients. This perceived barrier was already mentioned in other studies and implies that a change is needed in the workload of the GP and practice nurse [17] [18] [19] . The study of the ""Beweegkuur"" (i.e. exercise on prescription) showed that out of pocket costs were a barrier for the patients to participate [17] . The respondents in our study shared this opinion, but it was also mentioned that out of pocket costs could help to make a more well considered decision to participate in a CLI. This contradiction was also found in the study of Geense et al. [19] . In our study, some respondents mentioned that prevention is mainly seen as a task for the practice nurse. Practice nurses have more time to explain the CLI to the patient, and in the Dutch system DM2 and CVD patients have most of their checkups at the practice nurse. However, the qualitative study of Helmink et al. found though that it could be useful to let the GP ask the patient to participate in the CLI [17] because of the doctors' natural authority. The study of Geense et al. showed, comparable to our results, that the availability of a practice nurse is a facilitating factor for implementing lifestyle programs and that the attitude of GPs towards lifestyle interventions differ [19] . Patient engagement and paternalism in health care is addressed last decades more and more [20] [21] [22] . Shared decision making and patient centeredness is preferred over paternalism of the health care professional. Our study show that paternalism is still present in primary health care, because respondents mention that health care professionals tend to decide on beforehand which patients they believe would or would not participate in a CLI, without asking the patient. This is not desirable as patients are now excluded from participation while they might have motivation to participate. On beforehand of implementing a CLI, more attention should be paid to the process of shared decision making and patient engagement. The study of Elwyn et al. show that the degree of patient involvement will depend on the skills and attitude of the health care professional [23] . Possibly more education is necessary to develop the necessary skills and attitude of the health care professionals before implementing a CLI. The number of studies that evaluated projects in which a HPFI was implemented to improve health behavior of patients is growing and results with regard to effectiveness is not univocal [24] [25] [26] . Despite the scientific interest in this instrument, most respondents in our study were critical with regard to HPFIs. The overall opinion was that an incentive would only be effective in the short term. Their opinion is in line with most results in the studies mentioned and the argumentation for savings systems, which could influence the participant in the long term, seems plausible [26, 27] . The implementation of an innovation, especially a preventive intervention such as a CLI, in health care is complex. As to the implementation process, the model of Fleuren et al. states that different determinants could influence the implementation process of innovations in health care [28] . Among these, characteristics of the person adopting the innovations and characteristics of the socio-political context, are important to mention. With regard of the characteristics of the person adopting the innovation, in this study the barrier was brought up that health care professionals were not always motivated to implement a CLI or did not see prevention as their task. This also relates to aspects of reimbursement and financing of preventive tasks within our health care system. With respect to the implementation of a CLI placed in the socio-political context, financing of the CLI is a perceived barrier. To be able to overcome all these difficulties, a long-term view and motivation of all stakeholders is important. It is relevant to identify the difficulties that can be expected and that a longterm view is necessary, so expectations of the stakeholders with regard to the implementation process are realistic. Overall, many facilitators and barriers for successful implementation were identified in this paper. To design a CLI and successfully implement the CLI is not an easy task. Michie et al. have designed a framework called the Behavioural Change Wheel, which is based on the COM-B model [29] . This framework can help to design a CLI that can successfully achieve behavior change. The COM-B model shows the complexity of behavior change and the many factors that play a role. The components capability, motivation, and opportunity interact to create behavior and this behavior then influence the components. The results of our study on facilitators and barriers for implementation of a CLI is diverse, but seem consistent to the complex model of Michie et al. It is advisable to keep in mind the Behavioural Change Wheel when designing a CLI and the implementation process, to maximize the chance of success. We have interviewed people with different perspectives to get the overall picture and to be able to identify similarities and differences in opinions of different stakeholders. Besides the health care professionals, we have also interviewed management representatives per care group. The opinion of the management of the care group is important, because they can play a role in the implementation process of a lifestyle intervention by helping to set preconditions and eliminate barriers for the implementation of a CLI. Managers often have a clear vison on the development of the care their care group should provide to their patients in the coming years. Overall, no noticeable differences were found between the respondents of the care group in which originally the CLI with the HPFI would be implemented and the other care groups, which only offered a CLI. Therefore, all results were collectively discussed, also with regard to the addition of a HPFI. Since this study focused on the implementation process of a CLI by the primary care group we have not included the patients in this study who have participated in a CLI or who were eligible to participate in a CLI. Further research should also have attention for this group. Due to the complexity of the subject, a focus group study might be more appropriate for this target group. Further research on the attitude of the end users towards HPFIs is necessary to generate more detailed knowledge on the settings in which HPFIs are appropriate to use and in which it might be counterproductive. Moreover, implementation of a CLI will be only successful if the characteristics of the CLI and the eventual HPFI are adjusted to the preferences of the end user.Conclusion Overall, we have identified important perceived barriers and facilitators for a successful implementation of a CLI in a primary care setting. Essential preconditions such as structural funding, tailored recruitment strategy, a good infrastructure and communication between all stakeholders, and a good fit of the CLI to the needs of the target group are important for a successful implementation of a CLI. Another relevant factor is that it seems that a shift in attitude of the health care providers is necessary with regard to prevention in general and CLIs in specific. It should be considered as basic care instead of an additional task, which is voluntary to execute if the health care professional has time. For successful implementing CLIs in the future, a more positive attitude of all stakeholders towards CLIs is essential and it should not be without obligations for the health care professionals to offer CLIs to their patients. A HPFI is an instrument that is not used commonly yet and the health care professionals in our study were somewhat skeptical about the effectiveness. In order to motivate health care professionals who are involved in the execution of a CLI to have a positive attitude towards an HPFI it might be helpful get more insight how health care professionals and the participants of the CLI can be more directly involved in the process of designing a HPFI.Table 1 1 Respondents per care group for everyone, was mentioned by most respondents as a facilitating factor for participation in a CLI, because most patients have little or no intrinsic motivation to go exercising. In rural areas, this would mean 'within the same village' and in urban areas 'within the same neighborhood'. The intervention called 'Biowalking' was considered easily accessible, because it has a very low-threshold, just walking in nature with a group of participants. Many respondents had an opinion with regard to group interventions and the social aspect, but these opinions varied and no clear preference for a group or individual intervention was found. Social interaction and connection between group members was suggested as a factor that would foster the adherence of the intervention itself. A group is a binding factor, because it is pleasant, patients support each other and give advice to each other. Group pressure and positive experiences of other patients can be a motivation for participants. At the same time, some participants mentioned that the group setting could also be a barrier for participating in a CLI. Participating in a group intervention can be scary, because new participants are unfamiliar with the rest of the group.

The recent global efforts to ensure that international aid reaches vulnerable and disaster-affected populations have been marked by the 'Grand Bargain' stipulated by the World Humanitarian Summit (WHS) 2016. The Grand Bargain sets out 51 commitments that are strategically organised into 10 thematic workstreams, including the imperatives to facilitate more support and funding tools to local and national responders as directly as possible and increase the use and coordination of cash-based programming (United Nations 2016). Since then, international humanitarian players have committed to transform their mode assistance from traditional model of disaster response and operations that heavily focus on external mobilisation and procurement from outside disaster affected regions. Some organisations have made a bolder commitment to shift 50% of their assistance using cash-transfer programmes (CTPs) (World Vision 2019). In Indonesia, both humanitarian organisations and government have been collaborating with experimenting the use of CTP. For example, the Ministry of Social Affairs (MoSA) have been the focal point of the national CTP. The experiment of cash transfers by nongovernmental organisations (NGOs) in collaboration with the government for disaster response in Indonesia has been implemented in Aceh after Indian Ocean Tsunamis. In Indonesia, mainstream post-disaster and emergency CTPs from the governmental agencies are regulated by the MoSA Regulation No. 5/2015 (KEMENSOS 2015) . The subjects of this regulation are both MoSA and local governments' Department of Social Affairs (DoSA) at both district and provincial levels. The MoSA has been the cash transfer focal point in development context. It has been implementing a number of CTP-related programmes that aim at poverty alleviation and Humanitarian and disaster management actors have increasingly adopted cash transfer as an approach to reduce the suffering and vulnerability of the survivors. Cash transfers have also been used as a key instrument in the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This article uses an exploratory research strategy to understand how non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and governments implement humanitarian cash transfer in a postdisaster setting. This article asks: what are the institutional constraints and opportunities faced by humanitarian emergency responders in ensuring an effective humanitarian cash transfer, and how do humanitarian actors address such institutional constraints? In this article, we have introduced a new conceptual framework, namely the humanitarian and disaster management ecosystem for cash transfer. This framework allows non-governmental actors to restore complex relations amongst state, disaster survivors (citizen), local market economy and civil society. Mixed methods and multistage research strategies were used to collect and analyse primary and secondary data. The authors conclude that by implementing cash transfers in the context of post-tsunamigenic earthquakes and liquefaction hazards, NGOs must co-create an ecosystem of response that aims to restore disaster-affected people's access to cash and basic needs. However, in order to ensure such access to basic needs, the responders must first restore relations between the states and their citizens before linking the at-risk communities with the private sectors to jump-start local livelihoods and market economy. ensuring social development and protection in Indonesia since the last decade. The MoSA has recently been the leading agency for humanitarian cash transfer in Indonesia as it leads and coordinates both national and international humanitarian cash transfers through the humanitarian cluster systems. With or without the support of other ministries, MoSA, in coordination with DoSAs, often coordinate and facilitate local level arrangement of post-disaster related cash transfers. The formal arrangement of cash assistance for disaster survivors is regulated by the MoSA. Unfortunately, apart from the coordination via humanitarian cluster mechanism in disaster response operation, there are no clear rules regarding how NGOs should implement their cash assistance. Therefore, most of the approaches are still informal and often implemented by NGOs in close coordination with local and national government agencies such as the MoSA and the DoSA. The key objectives of disaster-related CTP under MoSA are: first, to ensure that the basic needs of survivors are met; second, to provide a well-targeted and efficient stimulant assistant for recovery and social protection; third, to ensure an accountable rehabilitation, recovery and relocation of survivors (KEMENSOS 2015) . The MoSA's CTP can be used for payment for building materials, living allowance, transitional housing, heirs, empowering the economy of disaster survivors, economic support for former combatants (in the context of post-conflict response) and support for villages where displaced and uprooted people are concentrated (KEMENSOS 2015) . International communities through Cash Working Group (CWG) -a mechanism under a sub-cluster Cash Transfers and Social Protection -distributed their CTP programme for at least US$ 25.2 million CWG in Central Sulawesi during November 2018 -December 2019. About 3.2 million out of the total were distributed in the form of cash assistance by MoSA in cooperation with DoSA, whilst the rest were distributed by NGOs.Cash transfer experiment in recent disasters and COVID-19 The tsunamigenic earthquakes that also triggered large-scale liquefactions in Central Sulawesi on 28 September 2018 had resulted in 2081 casualties, 1075 people missing about 211 000 displaced people and 68 000 damaged houses (BNPB 2018b). The total economic loss was estimated at USD 910 m (IDR 13.8 trillion) (BNPB 2018b) or about 350% of the total development budget of the Central Government Province in 2019 (Pemda Sulteng 2019b). One month prior to this event, a few big earthquakes shattered West Nusa Tenggara province, which claimed 436 lives and caused economic losses and damage of more than IDR 5.04 trillion (BNPB 2018b). The government and humanitarian organisations (such as Wahana Visi, Catholic Relief Services [CRS] and Red Cross societies) responded to these series of disasters including two smaller events in Indonesia in the end of 2018 with the use of cash transfers. During COVID-19, the use of cash transfer has been escalated. The Central Sulawesi earthquake and tsunami in September 2019 caused the isolation of most of the affected areas for several days. Electricity and telecommunications were cut off. Airports and ports, which were relied on for fuel distribution, were badly damaged. Landslides blocked several main roads. Disasters also impacted agricultural land, irrigation systems, fisheries, horticulture and markets. After the earthquake, many markets were closed and some were operating at only 50% of their capacity. Poor road conditions, damaged infrastructure and unavailability of transportation hindered access to markets in most of the affected areas.Background motivation and research questions We were motivated to examine the complexity of institutional dimension, including formal institutions (government regulation, government organisations, laws, formal market, etc.) and social-informal institutions (non-governmental organisations, culture, values, tradition, informal market, religion, etc.) of a CTP in Indonesia. Wahana Visi Indonesia was selected as a case study in this research because of its significant contribution to the basket of cash assistance in Central Sulawesi (for about 10% of the overall interventions from national and international agencies). It is essential to learn from experience using vouchers or cash transfers to meet people's basic needs (Rutkowski 2018) . Therefore, instead of showing another evidence of the power of cash transfers in humanitarian setting from other lowmiddle-income countries affected by another disaster, we use an explorative research strategy intending to understand how humanitarian cash transfer is implemented. This article asks: what are institutional constraints and opportunities faced by humanitarian emergency responders, in ensuring an effective humanitarian cash transfer; and how humanitarian actors address such institutional constraints.Theories and concept of cash transfer for disaster and humanitarian responseBrief overview of cash transfer as social protection Mainstream academic literature often treats cash transfer as primarily a social protection strategy (Slater 2011 ). In the context of poverty reduction, cash transfer is cash assistance paid either by government or NGOs to poor households (Miller 2011) Suppose development can be defined as an opportunity to expand human freedoms (Sen 1999) . In that case, disasters and pandemic events, on the contrary, can be defined as a direct threat to development through compromising human freedoms and human insecurity. Furthermore, deprived freedoms and capabilities can lead to different forms of human insecurities, including food insecurity and hunger. To what extent a person can cope with such crisis triggered by the events depends on the 'entitlement basket' ranging from producing food (production-based entitlement), buying food (trade-based entitlement), working for food (labour-based entitlement) and getting food aid (transfer-based entitlement). The potential impacts of disasters on the survivors' access to basic needs can be explained by the classical food entitlement theory (Devereux et al. 2020; Sen 1983) . In many cases, the original objective of cash transfer is to enable low-income families to access food (Slater 2011 ) and non-food needs (Sphere Standard 2018) in the time of perils, such as disasters, including droughts and pandemics.A libertarian paternalism project Conventional post-disaster aid distribution (in the form of commodity transfers, e.g., food and non-food items) is grounded in the moral imperative of paternalism, where external actors decide what is best for survivors of disasters and conflicts. On the contrary, cash assistance can be seen as a more flexible and relatively less-intrusive type of aid that is rooted in the ideology of libertarian paternalism (Tahler & Sunstein 2009) because peoples' choices towards emergency aid are not 'coercively enforced' but creatively embedded in a new practice where people affected by disasters can experience a higher degree of agency and dignity (United Nations 2016). To some degree, giving money to vulnerable people using cash transfers can be called a 'real utopia' (Bregman 2018) . We argue that it is 'real' because mounting evidence of the positive impact of cash transfers in humanitarian emergencies can already be seen from many contexts since the last decade. Unconditional cash transfer (UCT) is a form of 'basic' income. Unfortunately, it remains a 'utopia' because, despite accumulated evidence of its effectiveness in both humanitarian and development contexts from around the world, policy makers and humanitarian actors remain reluctant about the use of cash transfer because of the perception of associated risk including security, inflations and anti-social use (Bailey, Savage & O'Callaghan 2008) . The increase in the use of cash transfer as a key instrument in fighting poverty and vulnerability can be seen as a silent revolution in international development studies and practices since the early 2000s (Gliszczynski & Leisering 2016)Humanitarian and disaster cash transfer programme Humanitarian CTP has gained popularity in the last decade (Doocy, Tappis & Lyles 2016) and it has become more common today and is known as 'one of the most significant areas of innovation in humanitarian assistance' (UNOCHA 2020:76). Such innovation has been a widely adopted practice in international development context (Leisering 2019) . The merits of CTP have been well recognised in development studies literature and recently in disaster and humanitarian studies literature. For most of the proponents, there is little disagreement on the merits of CTP in improving humanitarian outcomes (Egeland 2018) . The CTP for both humanitarian and disaster response is more cost-effective as it has much lower transaction cost compared with conventional commodity aid relief that demands big logistical management costs. Cash has high convertibility in exchange; it also allows for greater freedom for the recipients and can stimulate local markets (Peppiatt, Mitchell & Holzmann 2001; United Nations 2016:14/22 ). Cash brings some degree of freedom that can support the survivors of disasters to 'prioritise their needs and meet them in a dignified way, which helps to stimulate markets and speed up recovery' (UNOCHA 2020). The current 'statement from the principals' of four big United Nations agencies on cash assistance in December 2018 boldly underlines international commitment to promote cashbased assistance with suggestion for improvement in joint data management systems to avoid duplication of efforts (OCHA et al. 2018) . Remarkably, where markets were disrupted by war and conflict, CTP remain as one of the most favourable form of supports in almost all sector by household participants in Syria (Doocy et al. 2016) . Cash transfer programme though has been widely accepted in remote communities in the Pacific, it remains underutilised because of lack of experiments from the existing humanitarian actors (Hobbs & Jackson 2016) . And notwithstanding pessimistic view of the current world humanitarian system as a broken system, critics have been interestingly positive about cash-based interventions (CBIs) including cash and voucher programming (CVPhereinafter, CTP will be used interchangeably with CVP and CBIs) as a form of innovation where partnerships with the private sector is recommended (Overseas Development Institute 2015; Spiegel 2017). Cash-based interventions/CVPs are also seen as a form of social protection that not only help disaster and conflict survivors to meet their basic needs (Thompson 2014 ) but also achieve humanitarian outcomes whilst helping local markets to recover (United Nations 2016). http://www.jamba.org.za Open Access Meanwhile, humanitarian and development actors have been thinking of the possibility of integrating CTP with social protection policy to address social-economic vulnerabilities (Gentilini, Laughton & O'Brien 2018) . Some of the concerns around cash transfers are central to the question of how effectively (local) markets will be able to respond to an injection of cash (Harvey 2007) . Other concerns with the question: 'will people be able to buy what they need at reasonable prices?' or how can markets that may be particularly constrained or disrupted in conflicts and during disasters be functioned in developing countries (that are often weak and poorly integrated)? Whilst many scholars agree that cash transfers can bring material benefits, some have also identified some potential drawbacks of using cash transfers. For example, experience from Zimbabwe suggested that resentment and tension might arise from targeting the beneficiaries (MacAuslan & Riemenschneider 2011). Even when the targeting is right, community perceptions might differ as the recipients might be seen as the winners whilst the non-recipients might be seen as losers. As a result, despite the potential impacts on material well-being, CTP could potentially have nonmaterial impacts, for example, relational issues between the recipients and the non-recipients, including compromising social cohesion and social capital (Pavanello et al. 2016) . Other potential drawback of humanitarian cash transfer includes the potential to undermine the importance of informal risk-sharing arrangements (such as reciprocal lending and borrowing and other traditional forms of informal social protection, including social cohesion and social capital). Context also matters. For example, in the case of post-war or post-civil war, high convertibility of cash might allow certain groups to easily access illegal weapons to prolong violence (Willibald 2006) . One of the most significant challenges in implementing CBIs in vulnerable and fragile worlds is the lack of a regulated cash transfer system. For example, the bulk of humanitarian money in Syria is currently transferred through informal value transfer networks (hawala), which appears to have the capacity to handle larger-scale CTP (Doocy et al. 2016) . As an evidence of multiplier effects of cash in both the humanitarian camp economies (of both refugees and internally displaced population), CTP/CBIs have been reportedly positive in many contexts (Abu-Hamad, Jones & Pereznieto 2014; Doocy et al. 2016; UNOCHA 2020) . A comparative study from Congolese refugee camps in Rwanda suggest that the camps with cash aid appears to increase refugee welfare whilst strengthening market linkages between camp and host economies (Alloush et al. 2017) . The use of cash transfers in humanitarian settings has been relatively new (Abu-Hamad et al. 2014) . Peer-reviewed publication, despite growing, remains limited. Most of the publications were made available by global think tanks such as Overseas Development Institute in London. Interestingly, most publications regarding the cash transfer focuses on showing evidence of its effectiveness in disaster response. There is still a lack of understanding on the institutional dimension of cash transfers including its constraints and opportunities. Some research identified both hypothetical and empirical constraints. For example, Doocy et al. (2016) identified lack of clarity of institutional mechanism including 'regulated cash transfer system for movement of funds into the country' in the context of Syria (Operational framework Humanitarian and disaster-related CTP is defined here as all type of programmes or interventions where cash or vouchers (for goods or services) are directly provided to individuals, household or community recipients (not to governments or other state actors) affected by disasters to enable them to meet their basic needs (World Vision 2017). Cash transfer programme often uses conventional planning cycle: plan, operationalise, assess and control. For example, it should be assessed and delivered at the right time, at the right target group. With the right planning, humanitarian cash transfer can also complement and trigger local economy including local financial services (Taetzsch 2018) . Therefore, the proponent of this approach must be able to create monitoring and evaluation measures (United Nations 2016) where the risks such as sudden inflation (Peppiatt et al. 2001 ) can be minimised. This requires a systematic monitoring and evaluation. The decision to select the best form of transfers (e.g. cash, vouchers, in-kind or a combination of all) must be based on a solid assessment including proper context analysis and the key important variables such as: [B]eneficiary preference; cost efficiency and effectiveness; impact on the consumers and on the markets, including issues around market access; the availability of goods and services; risks associated with the transfer mechanism; as well as the overall impact of the project on the lives of children and vulnerable group. (World Vision 2017) (see also Figure 1 ) Whilst acknowledging that cash is not a silver bullet, NGOs maintained the view that when partnering with governments and private sectors cash transfers can potentially facilitate social protection or safety nets including child sensitive social protection (Taetzsch 2018) . It also envisions the use of cash or voucher as a tool to connect the consumers with the suppliers (World Vision 2018). In order to perform an efficient and effective CTP programme, NGOs need to be mindful about local landscape of humanitarian and disaster management ecosystems where they have been playing intermediary roles in terms of financial and non-financial brokerage ( DFAT 2018; Lassa 2018) . This suggests that humanitarian responders should be able to broadly frame their response within an ecosystem to help them to navigate their response (DFAT 2018). Figures 1 and 2 imply an assumption that in order to design cash assistance, humanitarian actors need to understand the local economy and market dynamics in the aftermath of disasters. Therefore, implementing a successful cash transfer programming also depends on responders' ability to play orchestral roles and to connect with local humanitarian and disaster management ecosystems because their performance depends on the achievement of others: affected communities; local governments (from village to district to higher levels); private sectors (vendors, banks, insurance and situation of market's supply and demand); humanitarian clusters; NGOs (see Figure 2 ). We argue that it takes 'whole stakeholders' or ecosystem approach to ensure humanitarian CVP works for the affected population. Nevertheless, we argue that NGOs' approach to CVP/CTP can be understood from the paradigm of humanitarian ecosystem approach (see Figure 2 ) and post-disaster governance theory. Humanitarian ecosystem comprises network of organisms (actors and institutions) (DFAT 2018) that interact in an ecosystem ranging from local to national and international levels and across state and non-state players (Trias, Lassa & Surjan 2019) . Humanitarian ecosystems approach allows observers and responders to view all stakeholders as part of a system of networks that needs to be (re)connected, where in an ideal world each component interacts with other components. Every organism or organisation in that ecosystem has a role to play in addressing humanitarian needs and reducing vulnerability of disaster survivors (Trias et al. 2019) . Government organisations and institutions are equally important as other stakeholders including civil society, subnational governments, the private sector (banks, vendors and insurance), donors and other international humanitarian communities. Ultimately, grassroots organisations and communities affected by disasters are integral part of the ecosystem. We argue that humanitarian ecosystem approach allows better understanding on how localisation of humanitarian emergency response should look like. It is important to note that Wahana Visi's approach (see Figure 1 ) is not entirely unique to humanitarian response context in Indonesia. Some players such as Oxfam and CRS have also been playing an important role in humanitarian cash transfers and have become core participants of cash transfers working group. Whilst using similar approach to Wahana Visi (see Figure 1 ), the partners of Disaster Emergency Committee (DEC) (such as Oxfam, UK) and Swiss Solidarity have been using banks and vendors as key stakeholder in cash transfer. Negotiation with the banks could be frustrated and time consuming and delay the response as experienced by DEC's partners (Lawry-White, Langdon & Hanik 2019). Whilst for CRS, instead of using banks to deliver the cash to targeted communities, CRS, for example, has been using slightly different approach as they engaged Indonesian Post Office for cash delivery service (Ramadhan, personal communication, Respondent 13, Table 1 ). Post-disaster governance theory recognises the fact that after large-scale disasters, with the influx of national and international players, a more complex arenas or centres of authority emerge to manage the impacts of the disasters. The nature of such complexity is known as http://www.jamba.org.za Open Access polycentricity nature of post-disaster governance (Lassa 2015) , where responsibilities and authorities are distributed and shared by many diverse actors ranging from local emergency bureaucracies, social services, NGOs and business to national government and non-governmental agencies to international organisations including the humanitarian cluster communities and funders. Being mindful of such polycentric governance landscape is important. The polycentric nature of CTP suggests that the nature of decision making in humanitarian emergencies is http://www.jamba.org.za Open Access distributed in many domains and across scales and levels (Lassa 2015; Trias et al. 2019) .Research design and methodsData collection In this exploratory research, we applied mixed methods using multistage research strategy where the data collection methods started with household survey during July-November 2019. The quantitative data were derived from Wahana Visi's post-disaster monitoring (PDM) survey data sets collected in July 2019 by recruited 13 enumerators who were trained by Wahana Visi's Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning Team to conduct household survey using structured interviews with 510 respondents (239 271 female) during July-September 2019. This strategy helped to understand constraints and opportunities faced by local communities in accessing cash transfers. Qualitative data were collected by PDM's Focus Group Discussions [FGDs] during May 2019, followed by field works including participant observations and in-depth interviews during 04-13 November 2019 in Central Sulawesi and 17-22 November in Lombok. We also used institutional ethnography methodology as a strategy to understand the inner workings of cash transfers in real-time settings. This institutional ethnography was possible because Sulistyo has been involved both as a CTP specialist and the coordinator of Wahana Visi humanitarian cash transfer and the coordinator of CWG in Central Sulawesi since the project started. The researchers (external evaluators) (Lassa and Nappoe) also conducted semi-structured interviews with 51 informants including cash and voucher 28 beneficiaries (households) and local stakeholders ranging from bankers, insurance, traders, NGOs staff and local governments during 05-25 November in Central Sulawesi and West Nusa Tenggara provinces (Table 1 ). We (first and second authors) also conducted two FGDs with Wahana Visi's field staff to gather initial insights of the stories including the dynamics of the programme implementation including their challenges and opportunities. We also used participant observation strategy as we attended six cash and voucher distributions including one community meeting for cash and voucher distribution planning.Data analysis The authors used qualitative data information collected from Table 1 . We performed qualitative data analysis from various sources from Table 1 using Excel to tabulate the qualitative data from the survey and the qualitative data collection from interview. Coding table was used in the Excel file.Limitation We did not have the time to compare the response from both transfer recipients (the intervention group) compared with non-beneficiary households (control group). The household survey was based on random selection of the beneficiaries, whilst the eligibility criteria for inclusion of beneficiaries in the semi-structure interviews were initially based on random selection from the list of beneficiaries. However, after the first day trial, we shifted to stratified random selection as we decided to prioritise the profile of most vulnerable group with criteria, namely families with children and children under five. The main reason for this is because the humanitarian cash programme had been designed to address children's vulnerability.Findings This section presents the empirical findings based on the exploration of how humanitarian cash transfer is implemented in the real-world setting. Key challenges and prospects for improvement of cash transfer programming in Indonesia are highlighted.Context of intervention Following the disaster in Central Sulawesi, the National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB) received IDR 43.2 billion (USD 3.2 m) from international donors and distributed it as cash transfer through MoSA (Hikmat 2019 ). Furthermore about IDR 300 bn (USD 22 m) were Furthermore, using domestic grants, the MoSA/DoSA also allocated for the 1883 verified heir compensation (santunan alih waris or SAW). based on 1883 verified claims (Jayadin, Respondent 12 -Table 2 ). Thus, the total allocated payment was about Rp 20 bn, where each beneficiary received a total of IDR 15 m (USD 1100) (Hikmat 2019) . The other type of CTP was a living allowance known as Jadup (funded by international assistance). As of 31 October 2019, at least 87% of the total fund has been distributed to about 16 000 households (64 000 headcounts). The Jadup is a form of cash transfer/social protection -where each disasteraffected individual members in a household received IDR10 000 per day for up to 60 days (or IDR 600 000 for twomonth allocations) (KEMENSOS 2015). So, for example, if there is a five-member family, the household will receive IDR 3 m or about USD 440 for two months. Local DoSAs are the main counterparts for cash transfer in social development and humanitarian emergency context. In brief, DoSA distributes MoSA's CTPs.Rules of the game of cash transfers The inclusion of the Wahana Visi Indonesia's (WVI) CVP participants (beneficiaries) was based on three inclusion criteria: (1) non-government staff, (2) not currently working with private sector and having salary above minimum wage; (3) affected by recent disasters and can be verified by village/ community level officials (Respondent 01 and 02). The administration system of the CVP distribution requires every beneficiary to have valid personal identification documents (IDs). The IDs were also used to open bank accounts and insurance account. If IDs were lost in disasters, the replacement should be immediately provided. Wahana Visi has implemented three main types of CVP in Central Sulawesi: cash for work (CFW), multipurpose cash assistance (MPCA) and vouchers. The CFW is a conditional cash transfer where affected communities receive payment in exchange for labour allocated for recovery activities, including community development activities. It has been implemented at different stages, from emergency to recovery stages, during 2018-2020. The first CFW was implemented in early 2019. The payment was based on the regional minimum wage, where in Central Sulawesi, each selected participant was paid IDR 80 000/ person/day (each day is 6-h work). The actual payment was based on the actual number of work day. The second type of cash transfer is MPCA transferred via banks. The MPCA is a type of unconditional CTP that beneficiaries can use to buy whatever they want. The size of the MPCA depends on the scale of the loss and damage of the house of the survivors. Three categories are applied to measure the damage: light damage, moderate damage and heavy damage. For light, moderate and heavy damage to the house, each household were granted IDR 1 m, 1.5 m and 2 m per month, respectively after the disaster in Central Sulawesi. Based on the consensus amongst the CGW and local governments, the maximum UCT (such as MPCA) was for three months (Pemda Sulteng 2019). In addition, governments also have UCT distribution (see next Section) with a maximum of two-month allocation. However, the allocation of UCT is constrained by the context of government and NGOs trying to avoid overlap. Furthermore, funding is uncertain as most NGOs often make emergency appeals for a shorter period. The third type of CTP is vouchers which provide predefined goods and services based on community consultations and can be exchanged in specifically organised fairs or at designated service providers (World Vision 2017). For example, communities needed to have a kitchen set and household items during the early stage of the emergency phase in the disaster hit Central Sulawesi. Therefore, a voucher for a kitchen set with a value of IDR 1 m (USD 74) was distributed to each beneficiary household. In addition, each child from selected schools was given a school uniform voucher for IDR 100 000 (USD 7). Finally, we directly observed distribution of oneRoles of NGOs as connectors: Restoring citizenstate relations This finding is a pleasant surprise, and it is a result of our explorative approach. Tsunamis and liquefaction and the earthquakes on 28 September 2018 damaged and destroyed thousands of houses, causing losses of lives and valuable assets, including valuable documents such as land certificates, house certificates and IDs. During our interviews, one of the traders shared his experience that he was not allowed to get milk and water from a distribution point controlled by a group of military members near his damaged shop. One reason was that he could not show his IDs as they were lost because of liquefaction that hit his house (Correspondent 04 -Table 2 ). The moral of the given story is not about the good or bad of the involvement in untrained armies in humanitarian aid distribution. But instead, this shows a piece of evidence that disaster can cause loss of connection between a citizen (disaster survivors) and the state (governmental agencies) as disasters destroyed the 'sacred papers' (the IDs), consequently state-citizen relation is at risk. Therefore, disasters can potentially create new forms of social exclusion sponsored by the state as government officials might fail to establish their operation based on humanitarian principles. Humanitarian NGOs often establish their beneficiaries' registry before their aid distribution. At Wahana Visi, such a system is called Last Mile Mobile Solutions (LMMS) -a digital platform for beneficiaries' registry (World Vision 2019). The LMMS outlines operational questions: What are the needs, who are the beneficiaries and how to identify them? What are the community structures? How to verify the identity of the beneficiaries? Which agency holds power to verify the demographic information of an affected population? We observed that, in general, it was necessary for each beneficiary to show their formal IDs, without which they were not included in such a registration system whether being implemented by NGOs or local governments (e.g. DoSA). Whilst we asked 28 interviewees (beneficiaries) during 03-24 November 2019 regarding their barriers to access CVP supports from Wahana Visi, 7 out of 28 interviewees said they lost their IDs but mostly were able to get their IDs in time because NGOs facilitated the process. Only 4 interviewees mentioned their concern about the cost to reclaim their IDS because of distance and transportation cost. Our findings from Central Sulawesi are well-founded because, in times of emergencies, NGOs must work quickly to collaborate with the local governments from village to district/ provincial levels to speed up the process of IDs replacements. Therefore, despite not being seen directly as important and necessary by many specialists and non-specialists, government/local governments -NGO partnerships in postdisaster civil registration services are vital. Civil Registration Agencies (CRA or Disdukcapil) have been identified as one of the least known agencies in the aftermath of disasters (Respondent 03) -indicated by their absence in most local disaster regulation (e.g. see Gubernur Sulawesi Tengah 2013 ). Yet, Disdukcapil/CRA has critical roles in disaster response, as recently demonstrated in Central Sulawesi tsunamigenic earthquakes. Two weeks after the disasters, there was a mounting demand from local and national response agencies to validate and verify their data. Disdukcapil found that their role was critical in ensuring better targeting and identifying the authenticity of victims and survivors (Respondent 03). Without their prompt actions, the quality of social protection and humanitarian services will be affected. procedure including identification of account holders. As many lost their IDs during disasters, the NGO must work with local government to accelerate replacement of IDs to satisfy banks' requirements. Only 6 out of 510 respondents said that the process was challenging but without citing any reason as to why, and only two respondents had problems with the disbursement of the money from the bank. One of these respondents mentioned unmatched signatures and other reasons such as unauthorised representatives. The disbursement process also varies, but most respondents (482 out of 510) went to the nearest branch to get their money. Whilst 13 respondents said that they used automatic teller machines, the rest mentioned that they got their money from agents and direct payment at the village office. We were (first and second authors) able to participate in some of these processes during our fieldwork as beneficiaries and field cash officers come to the bank to process account opening. Likewise, we were able to observe how the recent shelter project from WVI facilitated Sulteng Bank to present terms and conditions for banking in a community meeting in Lero Tatari village in Donggala District. The survey data also confirmed that 92% (470 out of 510) of the respondents received information about such terms and conditions of banking. Despite the temporary nature of the humanitarian cash transfers, where the beneficiaries often get cash transfers into their account for two to three months, the CVP activities have been exposed to the banking system as required by the rules set by the project. This was the case in both the Wahana Visi in Central Sulawesi. Interestingly, such a vision is also shared by MoSA (Hikmat 2019) . But, unfortunately, we had no access to information regarding how many bank accounts remained active three months after distribution. The motivation of banks' participation in the humanitarian cash transfers varies, as they could be a mixture of social action, purely for business reasons, or political and economic reasons. Our interviewees stated that whilst there is only marginal benefit in the short run because of the nature of the humanitarian money that 'flying in but flying out very quickly' (Iqbal -Respondent 05 -Table 2 ), there is also the potential for the long-term benefit of marketing. Therefore, for the banks, the CVP certainly brought some degree of social service but participation in CVP can also promote banks' interest in the long run (Respondent 06 -Table 2 ). What is important to note is that the participant banks were either state-owned or local government-owned enterprises. Therefore, their participation was to some degree mandatory as required by local/national governments. (Respondent 05, 06). There were spikes of demand for banking services during the emergency stages, however the banks lacked requisite staff for field distribution and direct community engagements. For example, 'thousands of beneficiaries who participated in CFW demanded that the bank should send staff/teller to the field. In addition, in post-disaster settings, cash distributors often pushed the bank staff to work overtime during weekdays and even the weekends' (Respondent 05). However, in Central Sulawesi, the beneficiaries' registration was not a significant hurdle for the banks because there was a rapid response from the NGOs and the local government after the 2018 tsunamis. Most local governments in the province from sub-village to district levels were able to operate a few weeks after the 2018 disasters.Exposure to insurance In Central Sulawesi, almost 95% of all the beneficiaries signed up for occupational hazard protection insurance (BPJS-K) for the first time when joining CFW project. This has been consistent across Central Sulawesi (Respondent 07). The BPJS-K insurance covers protection for work accidents and loss of life. The payments for the insurance were made via bank transfer with a premium of IDR 11.000 (USD 0.80). Each worker is entitled to a pair of safety shoes, a helmet and proper tools. Children are not allowed to work (Respondent 01 -See Table 2 ). Like in Central Sulawesi, BPJS-K in Lombok (West Nusa Tenggara) said no observed independent continuation of the insurance after the project. However, the respondents stated that: 'BPJS-K were fortunate to involve in WVI cash transfer because CFW can be used as an insurance and protection literacy project to educate people about workplace safety and while marketing for the future'. (Respondent 08)Can cash and voucher programming nudges local market economy recovery? In general, despite being able to make progress in disaster risk management systems in the last 10 years, we observed that local governments in Indonesia will still need a more detailed plan to help the private sector recovery in the long run. Therefore, it is not an exaggeration to say that NGOs' CVP can nudge the cash economy in one way or another. This view is supported by a vision from the MoSA where 'financial literacy' was cited as one of the side objectives of cash transfer (Hikmat 2019) . The household survey data in Central Sulawesi suggests that 71% of the household buy their food and non-food items from traditional markets. Only 3 out of 511 respondents cited shopping mall as their destination. The CVP, therefore, could speed up local traders' recovery. In Central Sulawesi, most vendors were also survivors who lost either half to most of their strategic assets such as houses and shops. One type of voucher programme was kitchen sets. The vendors agreed to participate in a bazaar for kitchen sets. On average, signed contracts ranged from USD 7000 to 15 000. At least 7 out of 8 interviewed vendors who participated in the bazaars for voucher distributions cited that such an approach helps them to partially recover from disasters. One vendor who lost two of her private houses said that 'this voucher deal helped us as we were able to stand on our feet again' (Jumeha, Respondent 09 -Table 2 ). http://www.jamba.org.za Open Access Joining the voucher programme and participating in the bazaar also posed a business risk for the traders. However, for smaller vendors to participate in voucher programs, they tend to joint venture to enable them to bid for the commodities' supply and distribution. One of the reasons for joint venture is to share risks. They cited that they had to take risk as they anticipate the benefit from the deal. For example, HM (Respondent 04), whose daily sales were only USD 500 per day, decided to procure orders with a value that is 20 times his daily sales. He argued that he had to take the risk to participate and cited that trust is a tricky business. One of the risk management measures for the vendor is triangulation of information about Wahana Visi from peers, consumers, media and internet, attending meeting/workshop and visit Wahana Visi offices and being deliberative in signing the contracts.Discussion Most of the literature on humanitarian cash transfers, including CVA/CVP, primarily focuses on providing solid evidence on how cash transfer contributes to better humanitarian outcomes (Alloush et al. 2017; Gentilini et al. 2018) . However, previous research suggested that cash transfers, including CVP-related activities, can only be successful if there is a functional market mechanism, including institutions (Harvey 2007; ODI 2015) . The issue is what kind of institutional arrangements has been left unanswered because the institutional context and the nature of each crisis also matters. However, institutional arrangements do not simply rest on the shoulders of NGOs and governments as more players have been involved in disaster settings. For example, unlike the traditional humanitarian players, CVA/CVP demands local traders and financial institutions that function as aid distributors. Our findings suggest that the success of humanitarian cash transfers depends on a relatively complex institutional mechanism (Doocy et al. 2016) . Ensuring access to the postdisaster civil registration system allows the survivors to access external assistance, including cash transfers from local governments, NGOs and access to protection (e.g. insurance) and banking services. Tsunamis, liquefaction and earthquakes cause losses of IDs and essential documents for thousands of survivors. However, losing a personal ID card in tsunamis is not a simple event. Disasters can immediately cut the ties between the state and their citizen. Without proof of identity, disaster survivors become stateless. States and aid registration system can potentially serve as social excluders (Asia Foundation 2016). The formal institutional system, including the banking system, needs to verify the survivor's IDs before replacements can be facilitated. Unlike earlier understanding that social exclusion is the critical driver for socio-economic vulnerability and disaster creation, our findings suggest that disasters serve as excluders as they cut both social (between citizens) and civil ties (between citizen and the states). Therefore, we also argue that the first necessary response from NGOs in the post-disaster CTP is to ensure that the citizens reconnect with their state via fundamental civil rights, namely restoration of their IDs.Conclusion Using explorative research, this article asks the questions: What are the constraints and opportunities in ensuring an effective humanitarian cash transfer? What are the barriers to (access) cash assistance in emergencies faced by the people, including the stakeholders affected by disasters? and How the humanitarian actors address the challenges. We found that the first fundamental step to ensure cash transfer' success is to restore access to civil registration services immediately after disasters. Losing IDs multiplies survivors' vulnerabilities as they are potentially excluded by the state, the market and NGOs' access to basic needs. Communities' entitlements (to rights and protection services) are restored by nudging governments to recognise their citizen in perils, whilst at the same time nudging the markets to be channelled to meet humanitarian needs. Unlike traditional aid distribution systems, cash transfers require a more complex arrangement at different levels, as visualised in Figures 1 and 2 . We conclude that in trying to establish a mechanism for cash transfers to the affected community, the NGOs co-created an ecosystem required for cash transfers. In Palu, NGOs, including Wahana Visi, play roles as orchestrators of humanitarian response where NGOs connected the dots of the affected people (beneficiaries) with the governments and market. From this point of view, we can argue that NGOs participate in cocreating a disaster governance ecosystem in such a cash transfer project. This research contributes a new understanding of disaster governance and CVP at three levels: Firstly, cash transfers and their success depend on the institutional settings after disasters. Secondly, NGOs and private sectors can play a significant role by co-shaping the local humanitarian ecosystem to protect the affected population. They can orchestrally co-govern the humanitarian ecosystem. Thirdly, the traditional understanding of governance suggests that governments can monopolise the steering privileges over the other actors in both disaster and non-disaster contexts (Lassa 2011) . Findings from Central Sulawesi suggests that NGOs can transform the humanitarian landscape by their ability to condition and connect their peers, local government and private sectors to deliver cash services to the survivors.FIGURE 1 : 1 FIGURE 1: Illustration of work flows of cash for work and voucher.TABLE 1 : 1 Research instruments.

A quasi-experimental study was undertaken with smokers using quit4u between 2009 and 2011 compared with smokers using SSSs in the rest of Scotland.

Mechanisms of change were explored through quantitative and qualitative research that explored the views and experiences of service users and professionals involved in quit4u. The number of quit attempts made using SSSs in deprived areas of NHS Tayside increased by 44% between 2007 and 2010. quit4u had significantly higher quit rates at 1 month (49.9% versus 33.7%), 3 months (30.7% versus 14.2%) and 12 months (9.3% versus 6.5%) compared with similar smokers using other SSSs. The incremental cost per quitter was £2296. A combination of elements kept clients engaged and supported quit attempts: carbon monoxide (CO) tests, financial incentives, high-quality pharmacy support, rolling groups and greater varenicline use. quit4u may provide an effective and cost-effective model for engaging and supporting smokers in deprived areas to quit.","Introduction Using financial incentives to encourage positive health-related behavioural change, including quitting smoking, is of increasing interest. Debate centres on both the effectiveness of incentives in promoting changes to complex behaviours and on the potential 'moral hazards' involved in doing so [1] [2] [3] . Incentives might improve the effectiveness of stop smoking services (SSSs) through increasing take-up and/or quit rates. The most recent systematic review on the effectiveness of financial incentives in smoking cessation [4] found some evidence that incentives increased participant numbers. However, the evidence for the impact on quit rates was far weaker. Only one of 19 trials [5] had significantly higher quit rates 6 months after enrolment. In other studies, early higher quit rates disappeared at longerterm (6-12 months) follow-up. Cahill and Perera [4] conclude that incentives do not enhance long-term cessation rates but could potentially increase overall numbers of quitters by increasing uptake. A review on using financial incentives to encourage healthy behaviours more generally reached similar conclusions [6] . However, a review of literature from the last 5 years [2] is more positive, suggesting that 'when supported with other intervention strategies, such as social support and skill training, personal financial incentives can be effective in changing more complex behaviours such as reducing smoking'. This additional support may help reinforce intrinsic motivations to quit, at the same time as additional, extrinsic motivation is provided. This article aims to add to the limited evidence base by reporting the findings of the largest UK study to assess the effectiveness of combining financial incentives with free pharmacotherapy and behavioural support provided as part of the National Health Service (NHS) SSS. The quit4u SSS in NHS Tayside combines financial incentives with behavioural support and pharmacotherapy and aims to increase uptake of cessation support and quit rates. quit4u is targeted at smokers in deprived areas. Smoking is the most important preventable cause of premature mortality and health inequalities in the United Kingdom [7] . Although there has been considerable success in reducing smoking in Britain, there has been no reduction in socioeconomic inequalities in smoking [8] . In 2011, 40% of people living in the most deprived areas of Scotland smoked compared with 10% in the least deprived areas [9] . A key element of the UK and Scottish governments' tobacco control strategies is providing smoking cessation support through local NHS SSSs [10] [11] [12] . These services are effective in helping smokers quit and reduce inequalities by targeting disadvantaged groups [13] [14] [15] . However, quit rates among low socioeconomic status (SES) smokers who use SSSs are lower than more advantaged smokers [15] . The wider research evidence shows that, irrespective of the type of support provided, low SES smokers have lower quit rates [16] . Factors that make it more difficult for low SES smokers to quit include higher dependence levels, more difficult lives and life events which cause relapse, positive smoking social norms and lower self-efficacy [8, 17, 18] . There is therefore considerable concern to develop more effective cessation support for disadvantaged smokers. The aim of this article is to assess the effectiveness (quit rates and number of quit attempts) and costeffectiveness of quit4u (cost per quitter), and to identify the key factors that contributed to quit rates.Methods A quasi-experimental study was undertaken using routine data, comparing quit attempts made using quit4u to quit attempts made using other SSSs in Scotland. Propensity scoring, as described below, was used to reduce selection bias introduced by the non-random assignment to quit4u. The mechanisms of change were explored through additional quantitative and qualitative research to elicit the views and experiences of service users and professionals involved in quit4u.quit4u scheme quit4u was developed and implemented by NHS Tayside in partnership with other stakeholders, particularly Dundee City Council and the Dundee Healthy Living Initiative (DHLI). It aimed to increase SSS uptake and quit rates among smokers in deprived areas. It built on the experience of the Give It Up for Baby financial incentive scheme, previously developed by NHS Tayside to encourage disadvantaged pregnant smokers to quit [19] . The quit4u scheme was targeted at smokers living in the most deprived areas of Dundee ie DEPCATS 5, 6 and 7. DEPCAT is an area-based deprivation measure based on Carstairs scores derived from national Census data [20] . They are a composite measure based on population proportions experiencing housing overcrowding, male unemployment, low social class and having no car. The Carstairs scores are used to define seven DEPCAT groups from 1 (most affluent) to 7 (most deprived). quit4u consisted of three elements: (i) A financial incentive of £12.Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of quit4u Effectiveness was estimated by comparing quit4u quit rates with those of other SSSs in Scotland in 2009 and 2010. Data were abstracted from the NHS Scotland Information Services Division (ISD) smoking cessation dataset on all quit attempts made through Scottish SSSs from 2007 to 2010. The comparison group had access to behavioural support and pharmacotherapy (as described earlier) The effectiveness of quit4u was assessed using quit rates at 1, 3 and 12 months, with the assumption that all participants lost to follow-up had relapsed. The definition of quit attempts in these data is a modified version of the Russell Standard [22] . Attempts were identified as quits at 1 month if the individual had not smoked for the last 2 weeks, and at 3 and 12 months if, in addition to the former, they had not smoked more than five cigarettes since 1-month follow-up. The data includes CO validation at 1 month, but for a high proportion of cases (around 80%), a reading was not taken or unknown and quit rates were therefore based on self-reported smoking status. Self-reported smoking status was collected in person, by post, by telephone or by electronic means. Propensity score regression adjustment methodology was used [23] to take account of any differences in the baseline characteristics of quit4u participants with the comparison group of Scottish SSS users. Characteristics that are related to smoking behaviours and that may vary across the two groups were included. These were age, gender, employment status, exemption from prescription charges, area-based deprivation and smoking history (number of cigarettes per day, time from waking to smoking, number of quit attempts in previous year). Appendix 1 shows the descriptive statistics for these characteristics across the two groups for the estimation sample. The propensity score was estimated using logistic regression. quit4u was only available to smokers living in postcode sectors with DEPCAT categories 5, 6 or 7; thus, only data on attempts from these deprivation categories were used to estimate propensity scores. The effect of quit4u was estimated by regressing smoking status (self-reported quitter) as a function of a dummy variable indicating whether the attempt was part of quit4u and the estimated propensity score using a log binomial model [23] . Confidence intervals and P-values are reported for the relative difference. As the effectiveness of quit4u may vary across intervention settings, the analysis was repeated by setting (pharmacy versus non-pharmacy). Loss to follow-up is a known limitation of the ISD smoking cessation data. Moreover, the proportion of quit attempts lost to follow-up was lower in quit4u compared with other SSSs (Table I ). It cannot be assessed whether differences in loss to follow-up between quit4u and the comparator group reflect the greater effectiveness of quit4u and/or simply differences in service engagement with the client and effort put in to following up participants. Through the weekly CO tests, quit4u encourages closer engagement between the service and the client and this may have resulted in lower loss to follow-up, and, unless all losses to follow-up relapse, higher quit rates. However, more effective services result in fewer relapses, and therefore, in lower losses to follow-up (assuming loss to followup is associated with relapse). The extent to which any differences in loss to follow-up reflect differences in service engagement may introduce a potential bias in favour of quit4u. Sensitivity analyses were therefore conducted to explore the robustness of results. Robustness was tested in three ways that attempted to reduce the difference in the proportion Effectiveness of smoking cessation lost to follow-up between the quit4u and non-quit4u data. First, the comparisons were run separately for 2009 and 2010, as the differences in lost to followup between quit4u and other SSSs were smaller in 2009. Second, the comparison of 3-and 12-month quit rates was repeated, but excluding those missing at 1 month as the difference in loss to follow-up was largest at 1 month. Third, the comparisons were repeated using complete cases only. As loss to followup is likely to be correlated with relapse, complete case analysis produced a bias in favour of other SSSs compared with quit4u. Cost-effectiveness was estimated in terms of a cost per quitter from the perspective of the NHS, comparing quit4u with other SSSs in Scotland and quitting without using SSSs. All NHS interventions and pharmacotherapy used were costed using standard unit costs [24] . To explore whether quit4u was associated with an increase in quit attempts made using SSSs, time trends (2007-10) in number of quit attempts (using the same NHS smoking cessation data) in the three most deprived deciles were compared between Tayside (where quit4u was implemented) and other Scottish health boards. Reach (number of attempts as a function of the number of smokers) could not be assessed as no robust data were available on smoking prevalence by deprivation within health boards.Mechanisms of change A semi-structured telephone survey with a random sample of 130 quit4u participants (71% of those who provided valid contact details) was conducted within 2 weeks of registering for quit4u (Table II ). This explored their smoking history, reasons for signing up for and experiences of quit4u and quitting experiences. A follow-up interview of around an hour was conducted 12 months later with all who could be re-contacted (60.8% n ¼ 79). A purposive panel of 40 baseline survey respondents was interviewed at 3 months in greater depth about their quitting. The panel was selected to reflect the age and gender of Scottish SSS users, and included pharmacy and group support users (Table III ). Followup in-depth interviews were conducted 12 months after they signed up for quit4u with 23 of the 25 panel members who still quit at 3 months. Four individual interviews with pharmacists and a focus group with staff who ran groups were conducted, which explored their views and experiences of quit4u. All those signing up for quit4u between September 2009 and February 2010 were asked if they were willing for their contact details to be passed to the research team. A study leaflet was given to potential participants. A random sample of those who opted-in was sent written information about the study, providing a further opportunity to opt out. Participants were assured of confidentiality and anonymity. Formal consent was obtained from quit4u participants and professionals (who were also provided information about the study prior to consent). Survey respondents were sent a £5 voucher to thank them for their participation. Interview participants were given £15. The baseline and 12-months surveys were analysed using SPSS to create basic descriptive statistics (given the purpose of the surveys and the small sample sizes and relatively large confidence intervals; further, more complex analysis of this data was not deemed necessary or appropriate). The qualitative interviews and focus group were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were analysed using a thematic approach. Transcripts were coded and summarized under key themes and sub-themes using Framework [25] and NVivo software to ensure that conclusions could be clearly linked back to original source data. Coded and summarized data were thoroughly reviewed by research team members (R.O., S.M., A.A.) to ensure the systematic mapping of the full range of attitudes and behaviour described by participants on key themes. The accounts of different participants, or groups of participants, were compared and contrasted. The research team worked collaboratively to reach consensus in interpretation and understanding. Quotations from interviews are identified by participant (P) number and smoking status at the time of their second (12-month) interview.Ethics Ethical approval was obtained from NHS Tayside Research Ethics Committee (IRIS) and the NatCen Social Research Ethics Committee. Deprivation was measured by Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) rather than Carstairs DEPCAT (the measure used in quit4u) as Carstairs was not available in the 2007 and 2008 data. SIMD is highly correlated with Carstairs. quit4u was responsible for around 35.5% of all quit attempts in the three most deprived areas in Tayside in 2009 and 2010. However, other Health Board SSSs also achieved increases in quit attempts in their three most deprived areas over the same period, in response to government targets, ranging from 42% in Ayrshire and Arran to 134% in Dumfries and Galloway. This suggests that other ways of increasing uptake were available.ResultsNumber of quit attemptsQuit rates Table IV shows quit rates at 1, 3 and 12 months for quit4u attempts in 2009/2010 compared with quit rates for smokers from other SSSs, adjusted for baseline differences in age, gender, employment status, exemption from prescription charges, areabased deprivation and smoking history by including the propensity score in the regression model. Half of quit4u attempts (49.9%) were quit at 1 month, 30.7% at 3 months and 9.3% at 12 months. At each time point, the quit4u quit rate was significantly higher than that for other Scottish SSSs. Although quit rates in both quit4u and other SSSs This includes some people who had relapsed and then quit again subsequently. Effectiveness of smoking cessation fell sharply between 3 and 12 months, the quit4u quit rate remained significantly higher. Pharmacotherapy was used in the majority of quit attempts (88% in quit4u and 98% in other SSSs). Use of group-based support (47% versus 18%) and varenicline (18% versus 11%) were both higher in quit4u than other SSSs. Quit rates in quit4u were higher for both pharmacy and non-pharmacy (primarily group-based) support (Table IV ). The differences in quit rates were, however, much smaller for non-pharmacy and not significant at 1 and 12 months. The results of the sensitivity analyses showed that on average quit4u quit rates were higher than other SSSs quit rates with the exception of the 1-month quit rate in complete case analysis. However, the differences in quit rates were somewhat smaller and the difference in quit rates at 12 months was no longer statistically significant in two out of four scenarios.Cost-effectiveness The quit4u costs included the financial incentives, administrative costs and other service costs including pharmacotherapy. The average total cost per attempt was estimated at £191 for quit4u and £98 for other SSSs. In comparison with self-quit (assuming 1% annual quit rate [26] ) and taking into account intervention costs only, quit4u cost an additional £2296 per 12-month quitter whilst other SSSs on average cost an additional £1797 per 12-month quitter.Mechanisms of change-joining quit4u Participants' reasons for joining quit4u were explored in the baseline survey and qualitative interviews (at 3 months). Four main categories of reasons for signing up were identified in the qualitative interviews: the financial incentive, pharmacotherapy (varenicline and nicotine patches were specifically mentioned), structured support in general, or to receive specific support such as group therapy or CO breath tests. Thus all the quit4u elements appeared to have played a role in attracting different participants. These categories were not mutually exclusive. For example, participants described being attracted by both the financial incentive and the structured support. Participants' perceptions of the role of financial incentives in encouraging sign-up fell into four groups: those who described the incentive as the main reason for signing up to quit4u, those who regarded the incentive as an important factor but not the main reason, those who stated that the incentive was not a reason for joining but a bonus and those who said it had not been a factor at all. In the two latter groups the desire to get help to quit smoking was given as the main reason, with any possible financial gain being secondary or irrelevant. Participants' claims that they were not motivated by money may have been influenced by social desirability bias. However, among those who insisted that the incentives had not been a factor were participants who stated they had not known about the incentive at the time they decided to sign up. In addition, several participants stated that they had not claimed the incentive and did not intend to or would give the money away. That the incentives did not dominate thinking about joining quit4u was indicated by over twice as many baseline survey respondents (87% n ¼ 113) stating that they thought the CO breath tests would help motivate them to stay quit compared with being motivated to sign-up for the scheme by the incentive (36% n ¼ 47). Participants who felt that the incentives had been a primary or a secondary reason for their signing-up indicated that it provided a trigger or 'tipping point' to give up and to give up with support. These views were echoed by community pharmacists and smoking cessation advisors.Mechanisms of change-sustaining quit attempts Participants' perceptions of whether and in what ways quit4u had helped sustain their quit attempt were explored in the follow-up survey (at 12 months) and qualitative interviews (at 3 months). Most survey respondents (77% n ¼ 61) reported that they had found trying to quit with quit4u easier than previous attempts. Qualitative interview participants discussed the ways in which they felt this quit attempt had differed from previous attempts. In particular they discussed their perceptions of quit4u as a whole and the individual elements which they felt had contributed to their success or otherwise in quitting.The 'whole package' There was no consensus among survey respondents or interviewees over what was the most helpful element of quit4u. Although different individual components were singled out by individuals, there was also a view that it was 'the whole package', or the overall 'structure' of quit4u which had helped. This view was shared by successful and unsuccessful quitters. 'All these things come together, don't they? They become part of the whole 'stopping smoking', because you're going there once a week for 12 weeks or something.' (P172, quit)The financial incentive Of the 62 survey respondents who had received payments, 71% (n ¼ 44) felt these had been 'very' or 'quite useful' in helping them stay quit. Qualitative interview participants were split between those who believed the incentive had been the main factor in their staying quit, those who felt it had been a secondary or additional factor compared with their determination to quit or other service elements (e.g. behavioural support, pharmacotherapy, CO test), and those who maintained the incentives had not been a factor in continuing with quit4u or maintaining their quit attempt. These views did not appear to be related to quit success. Among those who felt it had been a factor in encouraging them to stay quit, the incentive was viewed as: a 'reward', 'bonus' or 'wee treat' for quitting; a 'wee bit extra to keep you going' with the quit attempt; providing 'something to work towards'; and a reason to stick with the programme or to keep going back to the pharmacist. 'I was going to stop anyways. (It was) just a, certainly a bonus having that there like. I reckon it would probably encourage you to keep going back to the chemist.' (P209, quit) Similar views were expressed by service providers, who suggested that the incentive encouraged participants to stick with formal support for longer, which in turn increased their chances of quitting Effectiveness of smoking cessation successfully. It was also suggested that the financial incentive might encourage participants to come back for support, even if they relapsed. 'It's also an incentive to come back as well to the Pharmacy, even if they have sort of failed in the first couple of weeks -again, you just use that to actually reinforce that ""OK, it's difficult to start with, but there's also £12.50 a week if you do sort of come a bit better towards the end.' (Pharmacist 1) However, none of the survey respondents identified the incentive as being the most useful component of quit4u. Pharmacotherapy, behavioural support, CO tests or a combination of these were identified as more important in helping quit initially and stay quit. This was again reflected in the views of providers, who suggested that the financial incentive in itself was not the key to quitting successfully, but that it helped keep more people engaged with support (pharmacological and personal) for longer.CO tests The weekly CO tests were regarded by participants as a novel and important part of quit4u. Participants described how the test not only validated their quit status, but also provided an additional reason for not relapsing (not wanting to fail a test). For some, this was related to wanting to pass the tests to receive the financial incentive. For others, passing the tests appeared to provide a motivation to continue with the quit attempt in itself. 'It was good getting the breathalysers . . . That made my day for some reason! What I wouldn't say was a great factor, was the money side of things. That didn't really, it didn't help me.' (P212, quit) 'I mean on the scheme that I was on before . . . there was nothing like that, so you could go in and go ""Oh, no. No. I've not been smoking"". But with this, you will know. So that's another sort of incentive to go ""Oh, I'd better not, 'cos as soon as I go and blow in that they're going to know!"" So that's quite a good thing that.' (P159, relapsed) The tests were also viewed as useful, by participants and providers, in demonstrating immediate health benefits from quitting. 'I mean it made me feel good that. I kind of had pictures in my head of my lungs getting better.' (P142, relapsed) Participants described looking forward to the test, a reason to attend the weekly support sessions. In groups, the tests were also described as providing a competitive element, which could be an incentive to continue with the quit.Behavioural support For participants who attended groups, being able to share quitting experiences with fellow quitters, as well as getting advice from group leaders and members, was considered helpful and motivating. quit4u had 'rolling' groups where new people joined at different points. These were seen as more beneficial than the traditional model of groups where everyone starts together, because they included people who had been through the stage of quitting that other participants were experiencing and with whom could share their experiences, advice and tips. 'It was handy just to pop to the Community Centre down the road, but also listen to different suggestions from different people all of what worked and also maybe passing that information on to other new ones that came a few weeks down the line as well. I found that obviously good, that you were able to help other people if you had information.' (P32, quit) Seeing the success of other group members, as well as providing encouragement and support to those at an earlier quitting stage, was viewed as motivational by participants and providers. Group leaders were also praised for their non-judgemental and supportive attitudes. Although participants' accounts of the level and quality of the one-to-one support from pharmacy R. Ormston et al. staff varied, these included some very positive comments about the support received. In some cases, this was contrasted with previous experiences where participants reported that they had just been given their pharmacotherapy and perhaps a leaflet, with little behavioural support or encouragement. 'This time it was a lot better with going in and having the 10 minute talk to her and that about it. The last time, it was just handing over the counter and away.' (P167, relapsed) Participants' accounts suggested that the CO test may have helped provide a focus for encouragement, praise and support. 'She made it good to go in there and you know, breath into your wee machine . . . And she got just as excited as you when it was just on the little '1' thing.' (P88 relapsed) Participants commented on the positive and interested attitude of pharmacy staff, their level of knowledge (e.g. helping if there were problems with the pharmacotherapy such as side-effects) and the time given to explaining pharmacotherapy options, encouraging participants and talking to them about how they were getting on.Pharmacotherapy Most participants in the qualitative and survey research had used pharmacotherapy in previous quit attempts. Thus using pharmacotherapy was not generally cited as something that made quit4u different from previous quit attempts, except where participants had not used pharmacotherapy previously or felt that the pharmacotherapy they had used this time was more effective (e.g. varenicline). It was, however, suggested that quit4u had provided participants with more information and choice about products, and that they were able to go back to groups or pharmacies if they had problems for advice or changes in medication. 'It wasn't a case of ""Oh, try this, this if for you"". It was ""try this, if it doesn't work for you come back and we'll try something different"".' (P86, relapsed)Discussion This is the largest study in the United Kingdom to have evaluated including financial incentives as part of smoking cessation support. It focused on disadvantaged smokers who have the lowest quit rates. The study used a range of quantitative and qualitative data and methods to assess outcomes and explore the reasons for these. The results showed that quit4u had higher quit rates at 1, 3 and 12 months than other SSSs in Scotland, after adjusting for differences in participants' baseline characteristics, such as deprivation and smoking dependence. The average cost per quitter was relatively low (£191) and given the reduced NHS treatment cost of smoking related diseases associated with quits [26, 27] , a highly cost-effective use of resources. Effectiveness was assessed using a quasiexperimental design rather than a randomized controlled trial design, which has implications for the robustness of the evidence. Non-random assignment can result in a selection bias. Although a quasiexperimental design is more likely to suffer from potential biases, a strength was that the service was delivered under 'real life' conditions. Propensity scoring was used to reduce selection bias from non-random assignment. However, the two groups may have also differed in terms of unobserved characteristics, such as income, which the analysis could not control for. There were also concerns over the quality of the data in terms of extent of and differences in loss to follow-up. The higher number of missing data in the comparison group may have underestimated the effectiveness of the comparison group and introduced a bias in favour of quit4u. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore the impact of differences in loss to follow-up on results. Differences in quit rates were lower in the sensitivity analyses and in two out of the four scenarios the difference in 12-month quit rates was no longer significant. This suggests that there is uncertainty around the longer-term effectiveness.Effectiveness of smoking cessation The sensitivity analysis included complete case analysis that would usually not be recommended with a relatively high proportion of missing data. Finally, the outcome measure was based on selfreported smoking status. Evidence suggests that the use of self-reported smoking status leads to over-estimation of quit rates [28] . The interest in this article is in differences in quit rates. The difference in rates will only be biased, if the tendency to over-estimate varies across quit4u attempts and other attempts. Although it could be argued that this may be the case for the 1 and 3-month outcomes as quit4u participants knew that their smoking status will be verified by CO tests, it is less clear why a difference would exist in the case of the 12-month outcome. It is also possible that taking part in the quit4u evaluation survey and interviews may have impacted on participants' quit success. However, only 130 out of 2042 quit4u clients took part in the baseline survey and therefore any impact on quitting success is unlikely to have been significant. quit4u's higher quit rates appear to be mainly due to the significantly higher quit rates achieved through one-to-one pharmacy support, particularly at 1 and 3 months. Participants' accounts of the support received from pharmacies suggest that CO tests may have given an additional focus for providing encouragement and support which may, in turn, have improved engagement between pharmacy staff and clients. quit4u's higher use of cessation groups and varenicline are also likely to have contributed to the higher quit rates, but to a lesser extent. Previous research has indicated that group interventions are more effective in supporting quitting than one-to-one support [13, 21, 29] and varenicline is more effective than other types of pharmacotherapy [21] . quit4u quit rates at 3 and 12 months were higher for those who used group support, and higher at 1 and 3 months for those who used varenicline. The comparatively lower level of loss to follow-up in quit4u suggests that a key reason for its higher quit rates was its greater success in maintaining contact with service users. Previous studies have found that low SES smokers drop out of services earlier than higher SES smokers [8, 30] . There was no consensus among quit4u participants over which element was most helpful in sustaining their quit attempt. Participants who felt that the financial incentive had helped them maintain their quit attempt for longer saw it as providing a bonus, something to work towards and an encouragement to keep coming back for support. The perceived role of incentives in encouraging participants to stick with support for longer was also highlighted by service providers. The CO tests gave participants an additional reason not to smoke, which appeared to go beyond the desire to 'pass' in order to claim the financial incentive. The tests were viewed as demonstrating the immediate health benefits of quitting, providing an element of competition, positive reinforcement or reward and creating additional motivation not to fail. These experiences were similar to those found in a pilot study, which used financial incentives as part of stop smoking support for pregnant smokers [31] . Women who were incentivized reported greater engagement with the service and described the motivating experience of being CO monitored and getting feedback on their progress. quit4u's use of rolling groups was also viewed positively. As has been found in other studies [32, 33] , being able to share the experiences, successes and tips of participants at different stages of their 'quit journeys' was motivational. Thus quit4u would appear to increase extrinsic and possibly intrinsic motivation, leading to higher engagement and quit rates at 1 and 3 months. The relative decline in quit rates by 12 months indicates that any increase in intrinsic motivation may not be sustained. It was not possible to isolate or quantify the unique or additional contribution of the incentives. However, this should not be regarded as a weakness of the evaluation. Attempting to separate out the effect of the incentive would have been inappropriate and misleading as other inherently linked elements, notably the CO tests, were also key. Mantzari et al. [31] have argued (2012) 'we need to be cautious about attributing the effects of financial incentives schemes to incentives per se' as they might operate through various pathways.R. Ormston et al. Previous research has suggested that financial incentives might increase the effectiveness of smoking cessation support by increasing the take-up of services and their quit rates. quit4u increased the number of disadvantaged smokers registering for cessation support. However, other Health Board SSSs achieved increases in take-up among smokers in deprived areas over the same period. This probably reflected increased activity by Scottish SSSs to achieve the national Health Improvement, Efficiency, Access and Treatment targets by the March 2011 deadline (to support 8% of their smoking population to quit, measured at 4 weeks postquit date, between 2008 and 2011, with priority given to deprived areas [12] . Thus it is not possible, based on the available data, to determine whether quit4u was more successful in increasing take-up of cessation services than approaches in other Health Board areas. Although financial incentives appeared to provide a trigger or 'tipping point' to quitting and getting support for a substantial minority of participants, so did the other elements of quit4u including the CO tests, support and pharmacotherapy. In conclusion, this evaluation indicates that quit4u may provide an effective and cost-effective model for engaging and supporting smokers in deprived areas to quit. The quantitative and qualitative data provide important insights about the elements of quit4u that contributed to the effectiveness of this model in keeping clients engaged and supporting them to quit successfully. These include CO tests, high-quality pharmacy support, rolling group support, greater use of varenicline and financial incentives. In combination, these elements appear to provide an effective model for engaging and supporting smokers in deprived areas to quit.quit4u signed up 2042 smokers between its launch in March 2009 and March 2011. Across Tayside as a whole, the number of quit attempts made through SSSs in the three most deprived areas increased by 44%, from 2372 in 2007/2008 to 3421 in 2009/2010.Table II .

Design-A population-based, longitudinal study of 4658 self-identified Latinos (primarily Mexican-Americans), residing in Los Angeles, examined at baseline (2000-2003) and at 4 years (2004-2008). Methods-Participants underwent a standardized ophthalmic examination. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) and CSME were detected by grading of stereoscopic fundus photographs using the Modified Airlie House classification scheme. Chi-square and trend tests were used to assess differences in incidence when stratifying by age and duration of diabetes. Results-The 4-year incidence of DR, ME and CSME was 34.0% (182/535) and 5.4% (38/699) and 7.2% (50/699) respectively. Younger persons and those with longer duration of diabetes mellitus had a higher incidence on DR compared to those who were older and had shorter duration of diabetes mellitus. A higher incidence of ME was associated with longer duration of diabetes mellitus (P=0.004). Worsening/Progression of any DR was found in 38.9% (126/324) and improvement occurred in 14.0% (37/265) of participants. Progression from non-proliferative","Latinos are the largest US minority and the fastest growing segment of the US population. In the 2000 US Census, 12.5% of residents in this country, or 35 million people, were reported as Latino. 1 This figure is expected to double by the year 2025. 2 Latinos have unique demographic, socioeconomic, and ocular disease characteristics, and bear a disproportionate amount of eye disease burden compared to other racial and ethnic groups; 3 With the aging of the US population and growing numbers of US Latinos, this burden is expected to increase over the next several decades. While there are few population-based epidemiologic studies focusing on the incidence and progression of diabetic retinopathy 4 and macular edema (ME) in Latinos many previous studies have consistently reported that Latinos have a high prevalence of diabetes. [4] [5] [6] [7] Among those with diabetes, the prevalence of retinopathy ranges from 30%-50% for DR and from 10%-15% for ME. To date, only one other study has examined incidence of DR in a population-based sample of Latinos in the U.S. The San Luis Valley study, 1984-1992, obtained estimates of the 4-year incidence of DR in Latinos. 8 However, the study was limited by the small number of young Latinos included in its cohort. The current investigation provided us with an opportunity to study incidence estimates of DR, ME and clinically significant macular edema (CSME) among Latinos in the LALES cohort and to compare them to other population-based studies in non-Hispanic Whites and Afro-Caribbean persons with diabetes mellitus. In addition to incidence and progression of DR and ME in the first eye, data from LALES have previously shown that bilateral visual impairment has more of an impact on a person's health-related quality of life than does unilateral visual impairment. 9 For this reason, obtaining incidence estimates of bilateral retinopathy and macular edema in a group of those who already have unilateral disease is important from a quality of life perspective. No previous epidemiological studies on incidence and progression of DR or ME have reported the development of retinopathy and macular edema in the second eye. 8, [10] [11] [12] [13] [14]METHODSStudy Population and Design The Los Angeles Latino Eye Study (LALES) is a population-based cohort study of eye disease in self-identified Latinos aged 40 years and older living in six census tracts in the city of La Puente, Los Angeles County, California. The baseline clinical examination was performed from 2000 to 2003, and the 4-year follow-up examination was performed from 2004 to 2008. At baseline, 6357 participants completed an in-home questionnaire and a clinical ophthalmic examination. Details of the study design, methods, and baseline data have been reported elsewhere. 15 The study protocol for this investigation was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics Committee at the University of Southern California and adhered to the recommendations of the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. All living eligible participants (n=6100) from the LALES baseline examination were invited to participate in a home interview and a clinical examination for this 4-year follow-up study. Similar questionnaire and examination procedures were used for both baseline and follow-up studies. Trained ophthalmologists and technicians performed a comprehensive ocular examination using standardized protocols.Determination of Diabetes Mellitus At baseline examination all participants were asked if they had previously received a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus and if they were following any treatment regimen, including oral hypoglycemic medications, insulin, or diet only. All participants were assessed for levels of random blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) using the Hemocue B-Glucose Analyzer (Hemacue Inc., Lake Forest, California, USA) and the DCA 2000+ System (Bayer Corp., Tarrytown, New York, USA), respectively. Upon interview and clinical assessment, definite diabetes mellitus was diagnosed for participants who (i) had a history of diabetes and were following a treatment regimen, (ii) had an HbA1c level ≥7.0%, or (iii) had a random blood glucose level ≥200mg%. Duration of diabetes mellitus was calculated as the difference between the year of diagnosis (self-reported by participant) and the year of the LALES baseline examination.Grading of Photographs for Diabetic Retinopathy and Macular Edema At both baseline and follow-up, participants with definite diabetes underwent 30° color stereoscopic fundus photography of 7 standard Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) fields for each eye after maximal dilation. Masked graders at the Wisconsin Ocular Epidemiology Grading Center graded each fundus photograph for retinopathy and individual lesion severity levels using modifications of the ETDRS adaptation of the modified Airlie House classification of DR. Detailed description of all grading procedures and definitions has been previously presented. 12 In brief, all 7 photographic fields were graded. Each eye was graded independent of the contralateral eye. Any discrepancies between the two initial graders were adjudicated by a senior grader using standardized edit rules. All data from the detailed grading were checked for progression or regression of DR lesions using a custom program. For eyes that showed changes in lesion severity by two or more steps between the baseline and 4-year follow-up examinations, a longitudinal review was conducted through side-by-side comparison of photographs from both examination periods. Graders were masked to the year the photographs were taken. Eyes with incident or progressed DR including ME were reviewed by a trained ophthalmologist (RK) for final confirmation.Definitions of Diabetic Retinopathy Diabetic retinopathy was classified by standards set forth in the ETDRS. [16] [17] [18] Diabetic retinopathy was classified into severity levels, each corresponding to a specific clinical characteristic seen on a per-eye basis while grading the fundus photographs (refer to supplemental table 1 for details). The retinopathy level for each person was derived by concatenating the levels for the two eyes, giving the eye with the higher level greater weight (refer to supplemental table 2 for details). For concatenation purposes, levels 12 and 13 are grouped as level 10 and levels 14 and 15 are collapsed with level 20. No DR corresponds to step 1, minimal retinopathy corresponds to steps 2-3, mild non-proliferative DR (NPDR) corresponds to steps 4-7, moderate NPDR corresponds to steps 8-9, severe NPDR corresponds to steps 10-13, and proliferative DR (PDR) corresponds to steps 14-15.Macular Edema The definitions of ME and CSME used by LALES were modeled after the definitions proposed in the WESDR and ETDRS. 8 Macular edema-An individual was considered to have ME (non-CSME) if at least one of two conditions were met: 1) there was thickening of the retina with or without partial loss of transparency within 1 disc diameter from the center of the macula, or 2) fundus photographs show focal photocoagulation scarring in the macula. Clinically significant macular edema-Individuals were considered to have CSME if at least one of three conditions were met: 1) there is retinal thickening at or within 500 μm from the center of the macula, or there are hard exudates within 500 μm of the center of the macula associated with thickening of the adjacent retina; 2) there is a zone or zones of retinal thickening, at least 1 disc area in size, at least part of which was 1 disc diameter from the center of the macula, or 3) there are signs of past focal photocoagulation treatment.Describing Incidence and Progression Incidence estimates for this study were calculated using three different approaches (refer to supplemental table 3 for details): 1) Incidence in the first eye and required that both eyes be free of disease at baseline; 2) incidence of disease in the second eye and required that, at baseline, one eye be free of disease while the contralateral eye have disease; 3) combined incidence in the first eye with incidence in the second eye to obtain incidence in either eye. Incidence of diabetic retinopathy-Individuals were considered at risk for incidence of DR if participants were at step 1 (level 10/10) at baseline. Individuals were considered to have DR if they had no retinopathy at baseline (step1: level 10/10) and developed a retinopathy level of 20/<20 (step 2) or higher at the time of the follow-up examination. Individuals were considered to have DR in the first eye if one or both eyes developed retinopathy at follow-up. Individuals were considered to have DR in the second eye if one eye developed retinopathy at follow-up and the contralateral eye had evidence of DR at baseline. Incidence of macular edema-Individuals were at risk for incidence of ME (non-CSME) if they were free of any ME at baseline and had no evidence of past focal photocoagulation treatment. Individuals were considered to have ME if evidence of ME (as defined above) was present at follow-up. Incidence of clinically significant macular edema-Individuals at risk for CSME were free of ME and showed no evidence of focal photocoagulation at baseline.Progression of any diabetic retinopathy (2-step increase)-Progression of DR required that individuals have a step score of at least 20/<20 (step 2) at baseline and that they have progressed two steps or more at the follow-up examination (refer to supplemental table 4 for details). Likewise, individuals who were at 60+/<60 and 60+/60+ (steps 14 and 15, respectively) at baseline were not at risk for progression, since they were incapable of worsening by two steps or more. Similarly, persons classified as step 1 (10/10) with no DR at baseline, were not at risk for progression of disease.Progression of non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) to proliferative diabetic retinopathy(PDR)-Progression from NPDR to PDR required that individuals be grouped into steps 2-13 (20/<20, 20/20, 31/<31, 31/31, 37/<37, 37/37, 43/<43, 43/43, 47/ <47, 47/47, 53/<53, and 53/53) at baseline. If persons progressed to steps 14 (≥ 60/< 60) or 15 (≥ 60/≥ 60) at follow-up, they were classified as having progressed from NPDR to PDR.Progression of NPDR toPDR with high-risk characteristics (HRC)-Progression from NPDR to PDR with HRC required that individuals with NPDR (levels 53/53 or less; steps 2-13) at baseline progress to levels 71 or worse (presence of high risk characteristics) at follow-up. Improvement of diabetic retinopathy-Improvement of diabetic retinopathy required that individuals who were at steps 3 to 15 (20/20 to 60+/60+) at baseline improve by two or more steps at follow-up.Data and Statistical Analysis All clinical and grading data were entered into a central database with internal automated quality control checks. Incidence and progression of disease were dichotomized into yes/no categories. Comparisons were made between gender, age and duration of diabetes groups. Age at baseline examination was categorized into four groups (40-49 years, 50-59 years, 60-69 years, 70-79 years) for all analysis. Duration of diabetes was defined at baseline and categorized into five groups (0 years, 1-4 years, 5-9 years, 10-14 years, 15+ years). The atrisk cohort for incidence excluded participants who were not diagnosed with the particular outcome at baseline examination. Conversely, the at-risk cohort for progression included those who were diagnosed with disease at baseline examination. Chi-square tests were used to detect gender differences, and tests for trend were used to detect linear trends in age and duration of diabetes across the predefined strata. Incidence data from LALES was compared with other population-based incidence studies using annualized percentages. The Statistical Analysis System (version 9) 19 was used for tabulations and statistical analysis. All tests were done at a significance level of 0.05.RESULTS Of the 6,357 participants examined at baseline, 6,100 living eligible participants were identified for the 4-year follow-up study, and 4,658 (76%) completed the follow-up examination. Of these, 904 had definite diabetes at baseline (of which 69/904, 7.6% were newly diagnosed, and 835/904, 92.4% were previously diagnosed), and 775 had gradable fundus photographs in the same eye at baseline and at follow-up, hence this is the cohort used for the analyses in this paper. Compared to those not included in this analysis, (n=129) participants included in this analysis (n=775) were slightly older (58 [±9.7] vs. 56 [±10.9] years, p<0.05), more likely to report having a good-excellent visual health status (39% vs. 28%, p<0.05), and were more likely to have health insurance (72% vs. 59%, p<0.05). There were no other significant differences in baseline characteristics between the analysis cohort (n=775) and those who did not have gradable photographs at baseline and follow-up (129). A flow-chart for assessing the analytical cohort is presented in Figure 1 . Of the 775 diabetic participants with gradable photos at baseline and at follow-up, 404 diabetics were at risk of developing any retinopathy, 647 were at risk of developing macular edema, and 324 diabetics with DR at baseline were at risk for progression of DR.4-Year Incidence of Diabetic Retinopathy and Macular Edema Incidence in the first eye-Diabetic retinopathy in the first eye (Table 1 ) was observed in 28.2% of the diabetic participants. Age-specific incidence ranged from 37.5% in the 40-49 year age group to 23.5% in the 70 or more year age group. There was an overall inverse relationship between age and DR incidence (P= 0.01), with age group 40-49 having the highest incidence. There was a significant increase in incidence of DR with increasing duration of diabetes (P=0.001), increasing from 17.3% in the newly diagnosed to 41.9% in diabetics with 15 or more years duration. Incidence for ME (without CSME) in the first eye was 5.0% (Table 2 ). No age-related association was observed (P=0.34). However, there was a significant increasing trend in incidence with increasing duration of diabetes (P=0.004). Duration-specific incidence ranged from 3.0% for new cases of diabetes to 11.9% for persons with 15 or more years of diabetes. Incidence in the first eye for CSME was 6.3% (Table 3 ). Incidence did not significantly increase with age (P = 0.35), but there was a significant positive association between duration of diabetes and CSME (P=0.01) (Table 3 ). Duration-specific incidence of CSME ranged from 1.8% for newly diagnosed cases of diabetes to 6.0% for persons who had had diabetes for 15 or more years. Incidence in the second eye-Incidence of DR in the second eye was higher than in the first eye (51.9% vs 28.2%, Table 1 ). Incidence of DR decreased with increasing age, from 76.0% (40-49 years) to 26.1% (70+ years), (P<0.001). No pattern was observed with duration of diabetes and incidence of DR (P=0.51). Incidence of ME in the second eye was 11.5%, double that observed in the first eye (5.0%, Table 2 ). Increasing age was marginally associated with ME (P=0.07), but longer duration of diabetes was not associated with ME (P=0.76). Clinically significant macular edema in the second eye was observed in 17.3% participants (Table 3 ). Age-specific estimates ranged from 25.0% to 23.1% for 40-49 years and 70+ years, respectively, with no significant pattern (P=0.96). Duration of diabetes was not associated with incidence in the second eye (P=0.17). Incidence in either eye-The overall incidence of DR in either eye was 34.0% (Table 1 ). Age-specific incidence of DR in this group decreased significantly with age (P<0.001). Incidence ranged from 45.5% in participants 40-49 years old to 24.3% in those 70 or more years old (P<0.001). Duration-specific incidence ranged from 20.4% (0 years) to 55.1% (10-14 years), then dropped to 39.5% in those who had had diabetes for 15 or more years (P<0.001). The overall incidence of ME in either eye was 5.4% (Table 2 ). There was no trend in incidence across age groups (P=0.14). Incidence of ME increased with duration of diabetes from 2.8% (0 years) to 11.1% (15+ years) (P=0.003). Clinically significant macular edema in either eye was observed in 7.2% (Table 3 ). Age-specific estimates were not significantly associated with CSME (P=0.53). Duration-specific incidence ranged from 2.3% (0 years) to 9.1% (15+ years) (P=0.002). Incidence of DR and Treatment-When we examined the association of DR with treatment for diabetes (results not shown), we found a significantly higher incidence of DR in people who received no treatment for diabetes (33.3%, 92/276) compared to those who received treatment (17.1%, 22/128)(P=0.008). Any treatment included insulin, pills, diet, natural remedy and other treatments.4-Year Progression and Improvement of Diabetic Retinopathy Progression of any DR was noted in 38.9% (Table 4 ) of diabetics with DR at baseline. When results were stratified by age group, higher incidence of DR was observed in younger age groups. Incidence of DR ranged from 58.2% for those 40-49 years of age to 25.0% to those 70+ years of age, (P<0.001). Duration of diabetes was not significantly associated with progression (P=0.17). Among diabetics with NPDR at baseline, 5.3% (Table 4 ) had developed PDR at follow-up. Age-specific estimates ranged from 4.5% for those aged 40-49 to 4.2% for participants 70+ years. No significant pattern was found (P=0.61). Durationspecific estimates ranged from 2.8% for those with 0 years to 8.3% for those with 15+ years of diabetes (P=0.08). Progression of NPDR to PDR with high-risk characteristics occurred in 1.9% (Table 4 ) of diabetics. Age-specific and duration-specific estimates were too small to test for differences since some strata reported no progression. Improvement of DR was seen in 14.0% (Table 4 ) of diabetics with some level of retinopathy at baseline. Age-specific estimates ranged from 5.8% for those 40-49 years to 18.9% for those 70+ years of age. The results revealed a marginally significant pattern (P=0.09). Duration of diabetes showed no significant pattern (P=0.48).DISCUSSION In LALES, we found that incidence of DR (28% in first eye) and ME (5% in first eye) in Latinos was high compared to incidence previously reported for US non-Hispanic whites. A higher incidence of DR, ME or CSME was associated with longer duration of diabetes, despite the fact that incidence of these ocular diseases decreased with age. For example, incidence of DR( in the first eye, second eye, or both) at the 4-year follow-up examination was highest among the youngest age groups (40-49 years and 50-59 years). One explanation for the higher incidence in the youngest age groups may be that the younger adults had a lower prevalence of existing retinopathy at baseline; 74% of the 40-49 year olds at baseline reported living with diabetes for a maximum of 5 years. We found that more (40%) diabetics progressed to any DR (2-step increase), and only a few (<1%) diabetics progressed from NPDR to PDR with HRC. There was no clear association between age, duration of diabetes, and progression and of DR. Improvement in retinopathy occurred in approximately 14% of adults with DR at baseline and occurred more often in those who were older or who had diabetes for a longer duration. Of the 37 participants who improved, none reported having undergone panretinal photocoagulation treatment, indicating their improvement was related to some factor other than surgery. At the 4-year follow-up examination, incidence of DR in the second eye (among those with DR in one eye at baseline) was nearly twice as high as compared to incidence in the first eye (among those with no DR at baseline). This finding is significant from a health-related quality of life perspective because individuals with disease in only one eye tend to rely heavily on their contralateral eye for daily tasks. When the healthy eye also develops disease, the ability of people to complete vision related tasks and normal activities become severely impaired.Comparison with Other Studies Compared to other studies (Table 9 ) the incidence of DR in the first eye in the LALES was similar to that reported in persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus in the predominantly white WESDR cohort and the black BISED cohort but higher than reported in the non-Hispanic white BMES cohort with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The estimated annualized incidence was 7.1% for LALES, 8.6% for WESDR, 7.5% for BISED, and 4.4% for BMES. The estimated annual incidence in the LALES is also higher than the estimated annualized incidence in non-Hispanic Whites from AusDiab study 20 (5 year cumulative incidence 13.9 %; annualized 2.78%) as well as in Liverpool eye study (5 year cumulative incidence 3.9 %; annualized 0.8 %) 21 . The WESDR study was designed to assess complications associated with diabetes e.g., retinopathy, ME, nephropathy. It identified persons with diabetes defined as having a fasting blood sugar or 140 mg/dL or higher or a random blood sugar of 200 mg/ dL or higher living in and receiving their care in an eleven county area in southern Wisconsin in 1978-80 different from LALES which included only participants with diabetes in the general population who had either been previously diagnosed to have diabetes or who were newly defined as having diabetes if the glycosylated hemoglobin was higher than 7.0% or random blood sugar >200 mg/dL. The higher incidence of DR in the LALES than in other white cohorts is consistent with data from previous studies showing higher prevalence in Latinos compared to whites even when risk factors e.g., glycosylated hemoglobin, blood pressure, was controlled for. Findings from the San Luis Valley Study 8 report lower rates of DR than our study. The San Luis Valley Study reported that Hispanics had a lower incidence of DR than non-Hispanic whites. However, the cohort for the San Luis Valley Study was younger and the study had fewer adults at risk for retinopathy (n=169).Strengths and Limitations LALES has several strengths. First, it is a population-based study with a large sample size and a high participation rate (76% for LALES II). Second, the use of standard methods of diagnosis and assessment of severity levels of DR allows comparison with other incidence studies, such as BDES, BISED, and WESDR. Third, the strict quality control procedures implemented in LALES minimize measurement error. Fourth, it is the largest study to evaluate incidence and progression of DR and ME in a Latino population. Our study also has some limitations. The sample includes all eligible members in a household, which may result in the overestimation of incidence if DR or ME are more likely to occur within families. However, we have previously shown that such a cluster effect does not impact the prevalence estimates of visual impairment in this study. A second potential limitation is that these results are not generalizable to all Latino subgroups because the study population is primarily comprised of Mexican-Americans. Third, since we did not study institutionalized Latinos, the study may under estimate the incidence of DR as Klein and associates have noted that those living in nursing homes have a much higher rate of vision loss compared to non-institutionalized persons. However, since Latinos are less likely to utilize nursing homes (compared to non-Hispanic Whites) for family members, we expect the small number of Latinos actually residing in such facilities would not significantly impact the incidence estimates. In summary, we found the 4-yr. incidence and progression of DR and ME in adult Latinos was high compared to frequencies reported in other racial/ethnic groups. These results emphasize the importance of timely dilated ophthalmologic examinations for Latinos who have diabetes and are at risk for vision-threatening DR. In addition, it confirms the importance of managing diabetes in diabetic persons to help detect and reduce the risk of proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

However, this approach is used infrequently, likely related to a combination of reasons including patient and provider concerns about adverse events associated with these drugs, and the inability to stratify patients with low vs. high risk of developing complications of their disease. To address these challenges, a decision aid including an online program reviewing benefits and risks of treatment options combined with a personalised risk prediction tool (PROSPECT) for Crohn's disease was developed. The aim of this study was to determine the influence of this decision aid on the proportion of patients choosing combination therapy for treatment of their Crohn's disease. Methods: Patients with Crohn's disease were prospectively recruited from 16 GI practices across the US (8 academic, 8 community based). To meet inclusion criteria, all patients had to be within 15 years of diagnosis, without any current or prior disease complications, not currently on IMs or biologics but considered a candidate for these treatments by their provider. This study was a cluster-randomised trial stratified by practice type, with 8 practices in the intervention arm (received Decision Aid) and 8 practices in the control arm (standard of care).","Demographics.Intervention Results: A total of 202 patients were recruited over a 3-year period, approximately 2:1 in favour of intervention (133) vs. control (69). Demographics were similar between groups (Table 1 ), with more women in the control group and slightly shorter disease duration in the intervention group. For the primary outcome, 25% of patients in the intervention group chose combination therapy as compared with 5% in the control group (p = 0.002). In the intervention group, 1% of patients chose no therapy directed at Crohn's disease vs. 17.5% in the control group (p < 0.001). There was lower decision conflict in the intervention group (31.4 v 33.9, p = 0.04). For the intervention group, patients consistently reported that the PROSPECT tool (87%) and Crohn's disease online program (98%) increased understanding of their disease. Conclusions: The Crohn's disease decision aid consisting of the online program and PROSPECT tool led to a significantly higher proportion of patients selecting combination therapy for treatment, lower decision conflict amongst participants, and increased understanding of their disease.DOP069 Improved quality of care and quality of life for IBD patients using mobile based remote monitoring platform: A randomised control trial   Ongoing collection of follow-up exit survey data captures overall medication adherence, system usability scale, SIBDQ, patient activation measures, and general health status. Results: Out of 320 patients enrolled, 162 were randomised to intervention group and 158 to control group (Females 49.1%; White 82.2%; Black 5.3%; Hispanics 9.1%; English as primary language 96.3%; Everyday Computer Usage 93.4%). IBD-QOL continued to improve among HealthPROMISE patients over a follow-up of 575 days (25.2 ± 11.3 vs. 30.3 ± 11.3 baseline, p < 0.001). Patients reported that uncontrolled anxiety (89.4%) and uncontrolled fatigue (80.9%) were major drivers of poor QOL. After an average follow-up of 495 ± 135 days, QOC improved among all patients (78% vs. 59% control), with a more significant increase observed among HealthPROMISE users (+28 ppt vs. +9 ppt, p < 0.01). After a second follow-up of 575 ± 135 days, compared with control, HealthPROMISE patients experienced a significantly greater increase in QOC from baseline (+34 ppt vs. +15 ppt, p < 0.01) (Figure 2 ).Background: Patients with IBD are ideal candidates for mobilebased remote monitoring care that is centred on enhanced symptom tracking and improved communication with care teams. The objective of this pragmatic randomised controlled trial is to determine the impact of the HealthPROMISE app in improving outcomes quality of care [QOC] and quality of life [QOL] as compared with a patient education app. Methods: Participants were randomised into intervention (HealthPROMISE) or control group. Primary analysis was a comparison of the change in QOC between both groups. Secondary analyses were made between the two groups for disparities in IBDrelated emergency room visits and hospitalisations, change in QOL score from baseline, and proportion of patients reporting controlled disease status. HealthPROMISE patients update their information and receive a disease summary of QOC metrics and IBD-specific QOL trends (Figure1).Figure 1 . 1 Figure 1.

Furthermore, to assess eHealth's influence on school attendance and quality of life (QoL). Methods: Patients with IBD, 10 to 17 years attending a public university hospital, were prospectively randomized to a 2-year open label case-controlled eHealth intervention. The eHealth-group used the web-application young.constant-care.com (YCC) on a monthly basis and in case of flare-ups, and were seen at one annual preplanned outpatient visit. The control-group continued standard visits every third month. Every 3 months, both groups had blood and fecal calprotectin tested and the following were assessed: escalation in medication, disease activity, hospital contacts, medical adherence, school absence, and QoL. Results: Fifty-three patients in nonbiological treatment were included (27 eHealth/26 control). We found no differences between the groups regarding escalation in treatment and disease activity (symptoms, fecal calprotectin, and blood). The number of total outpatient visits (mean: eHealth 3.26, SEM 0.51; control 7.31, SEM 0.69; P , 0.0001) and IBD-related school absence (mean days: eHealth 1.6, SEM 0.5; control 16.5, SEM 4.4; P , 0.002) was significantly lower in the eHealth-group. No differences in medical adherence and QoL were found. Adherence to YCC was 81% (384 of the 475 expected entries). None of the patients or parents felt unsafe using the eHealth system. Conclusions: The use of eHealth in children and adolescents with IBD is feasible, does not lead to impaired disease control, and can be managed by the patients without risk of increased disease activity.","I nflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are characterized by periods of relapse and remission. As a consequence, patients are treated during both active and inactive phases to achieve and maintain remission. Children and adolescents with IBD experience multiple challenges posed by their disease: unpredictable symptoms, a con-tinuous need for medication and frequent visits to the hospital, all of which are associated with increased risk of school absence 1 and deterioration of quality of life (QoL). [2] [3] [4] In addition, puberty is a vulnerable period with a high risk of developing social disabilities due to the disease. 5 It is crucial for successful treatment (i.e., control of inflammation) that patients acquire insight into their disease, and understand the importance of adhering to the recommended maintenance treatment regime. 6 Despite nonadherence being a major risk factor for experiencing a relapse and increasing the risk of acute hospitalization and surgery, both adult and pediatric patients often fail to comply with the continuous medication. Nonadherence is reported in up to 75%-85% of adolescent patients. 7 Taking all this into account, there is a special need to improve adherence to therapy and provide support and education in the pediatric and adolescent patient groups, without increasing their frequency of hospital visits. In previous work by our group, [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] we have investigated the use of eHealth, that is, a self-managed interactive web-based disease monitoring tool, in adult patients with IBD. The eHealth solution www.constant-care.com was developed to individualize treatment and optimize patients' self-management, adherence, QoL, and to reduce patients' dependency on doctors. The structure of the eHealth tool was based on a traffic light system (red, yellow, and green) visualizing patient-reported symptoms in combination with the level of fecal calprotectin (FC) in a total inflammation burden score (TIBS). Depending on the TIBS, patients were guided through the traffic light system in changing their treatment if needed. In a large randomized study of patients with UC (N ¼ 333), the eHealth solution showed shortened time of relapse and improved medical adherence, disease knowledge, and QoL. 12 One study has investigated the use of eVisit, that is, clinical visits performed through a computerized interface, to facilitate communication and follow-up visits after a flare-up in pediatric IBD. 14 No study, to our knowledge, has evaluated patientadministered eHealth treatment in children and adolescents with IBD. We believe that this treatment concept would be readily taken up by pediatric and adolescent patients, for whom web communication is already a familiar part of their daily lives. On the basis of the adult version, www.constant-care.com, we developed a new eHealth program, www.young.constant-care.com, oriented toward pediatric/adolescent patients with IBD to monitor disease activity, medication, adherence, school attendance, and QoL. This eHealth solution was designed with 2 components, for nonbiological-treated patients and for biological-treated patients. The structure of the web design differed mainly according to the level of monitoring, that is, a monthly control (nonbiological) versus a weekly control (biological). The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of eHealth on disease activity, the need for hospital contacts, and the medical adherence in children and adolescents with IBD treated with nonbiological medication. The secondary aim was to assess the impact of eHealth on school attendance and quality of life. Because of the novelty of the program, the patients' use and evaluation of eHealth were recorded. This article includes the nonbiological group. Patients on biological treatment were included in a separate study with a different eHealth-and study-design.MATERIALS AND METHODSStudy Hypothesis eHealth, including a single annual planned control visit, might improve adherence and/or QoL, and reduce school absence without compromising disease control.Study Design and Patients This was an open-labeled, randomized controlled (1:1) trial of an intervention using patient-managed eHealth (web-based disease monitoring) among pediatric patients with IBD. Eligible participants were children and adolescents, 10 to 17 years old, diagnosed with UC or CD as verified by Porto criteria 15 and followed in the outpatient clinic at the Pediatric Department, Hvidovre University Hospital. The Porto criteria for the diagnosis of IBD are based on a ""combination of history, physical and laboratory examination, esophagogastroduodenoscopy and ileo-colonoscopy with histology, and imaging of the small bowel."" 15 To meet inclusion criteria, the patient should have received nonbiological treatment (oral and/or topical treatment) or no treatment. Exclusion criteria were insufficient Danish language skills, no access to the internet, low intellectual capacity, growth retardation, and biological treatment. Recruitment took place from September 1, 2013 to April 31, 2014. Eligible patients were invited to participate by letter or by their health care provider during regular consultations. Enrolled patients were randomized in an open fashion to either the eHealth group (web group) or to the control group for a study period of 2 years. Patients were consecutively randomized by closed envelopes representing one of the 2 groups. The envelopes were handled by a person not involved in the study group and blinded to the person enrolling patients. On the basis of the adult eHealth web program; www. constant-care.com, [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] the pediatric/adolescent version, www. young.constant-care.com, was developed. Pediatric symptom scores were implemented, and therefore the TIBS algorithm based on symptom score and level of FC was redesigned in cooperation with 2 experienced pediatric gastroenterologists (A. P., V.W.) and 1 experienced adult gastroenterologist (P.M.). Based on the TIBS algorithm, guidelines for the patients were developed. Additional pediatric QoL and school absence measures were implemented in the web program. Weight and height measures, to ensure proper follow-up on growth, were added as well. In the program, a message tool was available for enabling the patient to write to the IBD team and receive answers in return (principal investigator or IBD-nurse) regarding nonacute questions. The message tool was developed because young people, in our experience, do not use email as frequently as adults. The text (i.e., information about disease and instructions) on the homepage was written for young people, and the homepage was designed by a professional graphic designer to appeal to young people.ProceduresWeb Intervention Patients randomized to the web group received a personal username and a log-in for the homepage, www.young.constantcare.com, and were instructed by the principal investigator face to face for 45 minutes, 1 patient at a time, in using the web program. Education was directed toward the patient, but parents/caregivers were also present during the session. Families were instructed to consult a doctor if alarm symptoms appeared (.6 stools per day, daily fresh blood in each defecation, fever, severe abdominal pain, or/and acute-to-severe exacerbation of symptoms). The patients in both groups could at any time during the study period contact their IBD nurse/doctor as usual, if it was felt needed by the patient or relatives. Every month, the patients with UC and CD were required to record data for the Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) 16 and the abbreviated Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index 17 (abbrPCDAI), respectively, using the web program. In addition, every third month, the patient forwarded a fecal sample through mail for the analysis of FC, [18] [19] [20] and blood samples were drawn at the local laboratory. The symptom score and FC level were combined into the TIBS (range 0-10), and all 3 (symptom score, FC, and TIBS) values were visualized in a traffic light system (red, yellow, and green) in the web program for the patient. Depending on the scores, and thus the color of the traffic light, different guidelines were given to the patient (Figs. 1 and 2 ). Patients received automatically generated text message reminders through their smartphones before each deadline for data entry or blood or stool sample delivery. Parents could receive these reminders too, if they wished. Patients were only seen in the outpatient clinic on request (on-demand outpatient visits), guided by the traffic light system, in addition to 1 annual planned visit. To ensure proper follow-up, ""web-rounds"" were performed weekly by the IBD-team (principal investigator or IBD-nurse supervised by gastropediatric specialized doctors). ""Web-rounds"" included follow-up on new web-entries from the patients, FC levels, blood test results, and ensuring that the patient/parents had contacted the hospital if indicated by the traffic light color. If blood test results required further intervention, the patient/parents were contacted directly by telephone, but if the tests were normal the results were communicated to the patient through the web program. Weight and height were monitored and if weight loss and/or growth stagnation occurred, the patient/parents were contacted. HRQoL (IMPACT III questionnaire), 21, 22 self-rated medical adherence (MARS and visual analog scale; VAS), [23] [24] [25] and self-reported days of school absence were obtained every third month.Control Patients Patients in the control group were monitored according to the hospital's IBD care guidelines (i.e., national pediatric IBD standard care in Denmark), with outpatient visits every third month, including blood samples and FC. In addition to normal attendance, patients completed MARS and VAS, PUCAI/abbrPCDAI, days of school absence since the last visit, and IMPACT III questionnaires.Ethical Considerations The trial was approved by the Danish Ethical Committee (Jr H-2-2013-061), the Danish Data Protection Agency (Jr HVH-2014-004), and was registered on www.clinicaltrials.gov in May 2013 (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01860651). All patients and their guardians gave written consent before study inclusion.Outcome MeasuresPrimary Outcomes Disease activity. Medication (type, dose) and step-up in treatment intensity (escalating dose or change/addition of a more potent drug) were obtained from the patient's medical record during the study period, as a proxy of progression in disease activity. Patients in both the eHealth and control groups were instructed to self-report symptoms using the Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) or abbreviated Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (abbrPCDAI). Both are validated pediatric symptom-based disease activity indices (range between 0-85 and 0-60 points, respectively). Disease activity is categorized as following: PUCAI: ,10, none; 10 to 34, mild; 35 to 64, moderate; .64, severe; 16 and abbrPCDAI: ,10, none; 10 to 15, mild; 16 to 25, moderate; .25, severe. 17 In the abbrPCDAI, the last item includes an examination of the abdomen. Patients in the web group learned during the education session how to self-assess the abdomen and how to recognize tenderness and an abdominal mass. Patients in the control group completed the questionnaire in the waiting area before consultation with their health care provider, and due to practicalities in the waiting area, it was not possible for the patient to lie down to self-examine the abdomen. Therefore, the last item was assessed by the patient's health care provider during consultation. FC is a stable protein released from leucocytes and is a sensitive marker of inflammation in the intestine. [18] [19] [20] The FC analyses were performed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Calpro Ltd., Lysaker, Norway), either manually or using a Dynex system. To monitor disease activity and medication side effects, the following routine blood tests were measured: C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, orosomucoid, red and white blood cell counts, thrombocytes, albumin, amylase, liver function tests, creatinine, and vitamin D. Contacts to the hospital. From the patient's medical record, the following information was obtained during the study period: outpatient visits (number), hospitalizations (number, type, and length), phone calls to doctor and nurses (number), endoscopic and imaging procedures (type and number). Medical adherence. The Medication Adherence Report Scale (MARS) is a medication adherence self-reported tool and consists of 5 items concerning medication intake: I alter the dose/I forget to use it/I stop taking it for a while/I decide to miss out on a dose/I take less than instructed. Answers were given on a 5-point Likert scale (range 5-25 points). 23 The adherence VAS is a 10-cm long line representing a spectrum from ""always"" taking medicine to ""never"" doing so. 24, 25 The patients set a mark on the line, representing how often they take the medicine. A score of or above 80% in both the MARS and VAS indicates that the patient is adherent to the treatment.Secondary Outcomes School absence and HRQoL. Days of school absence were self-reported by the patient in a preprinted form. IMPACT III is a self-reported HRQoL questionnaire developed by the Pediatric IBD working group, quality of life. 22 The questionnaire consists of 35 items divided according to 6 domains: Bowel symptoms, Systemic symptoms, Emotional functioning, Social functioning, Body Image, and Treatment. Answers were given on a 5-point Likert scale (range 35-175). No precise cutoffs exist for poor or high levels of HRQoL, but a higher score represents a higher HRQoL performance. Before this study, the questionnaire was translated into Danish and implemented in the web application in cooperation with the Pediatric IBD working group of quality of life through a ""Trans-Cultural-adaptation"" method. 26 Use and evaluation of the eHealth program. Adherence to the eHealth program was prospectively registered by the IBD team as the number of actual entries of symptom scores and FC samples when compared with the number of entries expected. The eHealth program deliberately did not make it possible for the patient to deliver an incomplete symptom score, and therefore all registrations were fully completed. At the end of the project, a patient-parent tandem evaluation questionnaire of 13 items on a 5-point Likert scale was collected from the web group. The questionnaire was delivered to participants on paper. Questions addressed both the patient's and parents' experience of using the eHealth program and concerned the following issues: feeling of safety and satisfaction, knowledge gained', management and understanding of IBD, worries about the disease during trial, and recommendation of the eHealth tool to others.Data Analysis Power calculation was made on the basis of a mean Medication Adherence Report Scale (MARS) score of 20.67; SD 4.01. 23 Using a power of 80%, a significance level of 5%, and an actual difference of three on the MARS scale, 58 participants were needed. Data were analyzed as intention to treat. Because of the nonparametric distribution of outpatient visits, hospitalizations, and phone calls to doctors and nurses, the Wilcoxon sum rank test was used to compare the web and control groups. T-test was used to compare the absence from school between the 2 groups. To account for the longitudinally collected data, alterations during the observed period comparing the web and control groups regarding disease activity (symptom score, blood test, and FC), medical adherence, and HRQoL were analyzed using a mixed-effect model (MEM). MEM models included a random patient effect and a fixed effect interaction between group and time, to evaluate difference between the groups over time. Further adjustment variables that were included are listed below for the specific models. Time to drop out, first on-demand visit, and step-up in treatment were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. P value ,0.05 was considered as significant. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS Enterprise Guide 7.1 and the statistical computing program R 3.2.2, R Core Team 2015 (R: A language and environment for statistical computing, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria; URL https://www.R-project.org/).RESULTSInclusion During the inclusion period of 8 months, and from a total of 99 eligible patients, 53 patients were included and randomized to either the web (n ¼ 27) or control group (n ¼ 26). Follow-up data are shown in Figure 3 . Demographic data for both groups are shown in Table 1 . We found no significant differences in the drop out of patients after inclusion or in the total number of days of participation when comparing web and control groups (Kaplan-Meier analysis: log rank P value ¼ 0.25).Primary OutcomeDisease Activity The time to first step-up in treatment intensity did not differ between the web and control groups (Fig. 4 ), confirming that the eHealth intervention did not negatively interfere with treatment quality. In total, 607 symptom scores (439 web, 168 control) and 280 FC (158 web, 122 control) were collected. The MEM analysis corrected by disease type (UC/CD) revealed no difference between web and control patients in disease activity based on symptom scores. The same MEM analysis, adjusted by age and disease type, showed no difference in FC levels. The following blood analyses were collected: 323 C-reactive protein (158 web, 165 control), 296 orosomucoid (136 web, 160 control), and 310 erythrocyte sedimentation rate (148 web, 162 control). No differences in C-reactive protein, orosomucoid or erythrocyte sedimentation rate were found using the MEM when comparing web and control groups during the observation period.Contacts to the Hospital The number of total outpatient visits in the web group was 85 (median 2, interquartile range 2-3) and in the control group was 185 (median 8, interquartile range 4-9) (P value # 0.0001) (Table 2 ). The number of extra outpatient visits (the on-demand visits), that is, in addition to the annual visit in the web group and the quarterly visits in the control group showed no differences; neither did time to first on-demand visit differ (log rank P value 0.395). The number of hospitalizations was not significantly different between the 2 groups, but a tendency to fewer hospitalizations in the web group was apparent (P value ¼ 0.13), Table 2 . No difference was seen in use of imaging diagnostic tests (web/ control: gastroscopy, 5/3; ileocolonoscopy, 4/6; magnetic resonance imaging [small bowel], 3/4; ultrasonography of abdomen, 2/1; and capsule endoscopy, 1/1) or numbers of phone calls to doctor or nurse.Medical Adherence Medical adherence represented by the MARS and VAS scores during the study period showed no difference between the 2 groups using the MEM when adjusted for age and time from diagnosis. The mean baseline of MARS in the web group was 23.7 (SEM 0.26; 95% CI, 23.2-24.3) and in the control group was 23 (SEM 0.5; 95% CI, 22.0-23.9).Secondary OutcomeSchool Absence and HRQoL A significant difference was observed in the number of IBDrelated days of absence from school between the web (mean 1.6 days per patient, SEM 0.5) and the control groups (mean 16.5 days per patient, SEM 4.4; P value ¼ 0.002). In total, 335 IMPACT III questionnaires were answered: web 167 (UC 117, CD 50), control 168 (UC 84, CD 84). Mean score at baseline showed no statistically significant difference: web 149 (SEM 2.8; 95% CI, 144-155), control 145 (SEM 1.9; 95% CI, 141-149). Using the MEM adjusted for sex and age at inclusion, there was no difference in the alterations of IMPACT III score during the observation period when comparing the web and control groups. Looking at sub-scores regarding the 6 domains (Bowel symptoms, Systemic symptoms, Emotional functioning, Social functioning, Body Image, and Treatment), only Emotional functioning scored a significantly lower HRQoL in the web group (P value ¼ 0.03; Estimate 20.003 per day; 95% CI, 20.006 to 20.0003).Use and Evaluation of the eHealth Program Adherence to using the web program as directed was 81% (in total 384 of the 475 expected entries were obtained). The median number of extra text messages or phone call reminders in excess of the automatically generated was 4 (range 0-17): 1 patient had 17, 2 patients had 9 to 11, 9 patients had 5 to 8, and 15 patients had #4 extra text messages. Regarding outpatient visits, the control group completed 87% (146 of the 168 expected) and the web group 100% (38 of the 38 expected). We have not compared the study groups for adherence to outpatient visits as the control group patients were expected to show up to outpatient visits every third month, whereas the web group only once a year. The final evaluation questionnaires after 2 years of participation were completed by 93% ( 14 ) in the web group and 83% (15) in the control group. None of the patients or parents felt insecure or unsafe using the web-system. Seventy-eight percentage (patients) and 69% (parents) would recommend using the Website to others; 21% (patients) and 31% (parents) were neutral; and none answered that they would not recommend it. After participating in the web project, 50% of the patients felt that they had a better understanding and knowledge of their own disease. This was confirmed by 53% of the parents.DISCUSSION This study is the first interactive patient-administered eHealth disease monitoring trial in pediatric and adolescents patients with IBD with a focus on the use of eHealth. The homepage, young.constant-care.com, was developed and tested for the first time in this study and represents an innovation for optimizing care in a challenged patient group.Main Results In this open-label randomized controlled trial, we demonstrated that self-managed eHealth is feasible and safe in children and adolescents with IBD. Without causing an increase in disease activity or escalating treatment, we found that patients monitored by the eHealth program needed fewer outpatient visits when compared with those undergoing standard care. Medical adherence was comparable in both groups, but the web group experienced less absence from school when compared with the control group. HRQoL did not differ between the 2 groups.Safety and Usability of eHealth It has been established that patients' disease knowledge and focus on adherence to treatment can improve chronic disease outcome [27] [28] [29] and that self-management can individualize and optimize patient care. 30 In our study, we found that despite fewer outpatient visits and an enhanced patient monitoring responsibility  No significant differences between the 2 groups were found. abbrPCDAI, abbreviated Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index; PUCAI, Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index. (self-management) in the intervention group, no increases in disease activity or treatment were seen. In fact, a tendency to fewer hospitalizations was found. The adherence to the web program was .80%. This shows that pediatric and adolescent patients can use eHealth to monitor their IBD and that the use of the web application is feasible and safe. Insights into, and knowledge of, their disease are key elements of self-management, and half of the patients reported that these elements had improved after 2 years of participation. We did not find an improvement in medical adherence in the intervention group. Results from adult IBD eHealth studies have shown divergent results regarding adherence, where Cross et al 31 reported no change, whereas Pedersen et al 9 and Elkjaer et al 12 found an enhanced adherence. In our eHealth study, adherence levels at baseline in the web and control groups were high, with little room for improvement. The high baseline reflects the limitations of self-reported medical adherence as the only measure of medical adherence, as patients are likely to report a falsely high adherence rate. This is emphasized by the high nonadherence rates (75%-85% among adolescents) found in studies using objective measures, that is, Medication Event Monitoring Systems (MEMS). 7 The measure of adherence should preferably be measured using both self-reported and objective measures, that is, a pill-count, MEMS, or blood level amounts of the treatment drug. However, in this self-administered eHealth study, we found it consistent with the self-management ethos to use a selfreported measure rather than an objective adherence measure. To achieve enhanced medical adherence, a change-of-behavior approach should probably be considered, as addressed by Hommel et al. 32 The use of various telecommunications tools in the care of children and adolescents with diabetes and asthma has already been evaluated in several reviews. [33] [34] [35] Regardless of the tool (e.g., Mobile phone communication/Remote Disease Monitoring/Phone and Video communication/Smartphone Applications/computerguided education system), the conclusion of 2 reviews 33, 34 was that diabetic telecommunication improves glycemic control (level of HbA1c), but offers a less convincing improvement in diabetes control (adherence to self-monitoring blood glucose). Satisfaction with a telecommunication tool was high, and despite inconsistent measures of ""self-management,"" this item was found to be improved. No adverse events were reported and one study found lower hospitalization rates for diabetic complications. 36 In a very recent study, the use of telemedicine, (eVisit, i.e., a clinical visit performed through a computerized interface, and e-Messaging) allowed more continuous communication and timely follow-ups in pediatric IBD. 14 Even when allowing for the differences between diabetes, asthma, and IBD care, telecommunication and eHealth approaches seem feasible, useful, and safe in the care of children and adolescent patients.Absence from School We have assumed that the fewer days of school absence in the eHealth group observed in this study likewise mirrors less absence from social activities. During the study, patients in the control group had more outpatient visits and more hospitalizations than the intervention group; however, this difference does not explain the aforementioned finding alone. Previous adult IBD eHealth 12 and self-management studies 30 have shown that eHealth allows patients to recognize a flare-up and receive adequate and relevant treatment significantly faster than patients receiving standard outpatient care. It should be noted that school absence in our study was self-reported, with a risk of reporting bias, but as both groups self-reported we expect the effect of any such bias to be minimal.HRQoL We did not find improvement or deterioration in HRQoL comparing the eHealth with the control group. A recent systematic review of eHealth technologies in adult IBD concluded that QoL improvement has been consistent in the reviewed publications. 37 Compared with adult care, pediatric care has a more tightly controlled strategy as patients are seen in the outpatient clinic with 3 months (pediatric) versus 6-to 12-month intervals or on demand (adult). Furthermore, the pediatric IBD-care team is handled by a few IBD-specialists and IBD-nurses, that is, the family has a close relationship to the IBD-care team. Outpatient visits in pediatric settings are calculated to have a duration of 30 to 60 minutes compared with 10 to 15 minutes in the adult care set-up. Pediatric care has more financial resources available per patient compared with the adult care, and a further improvement of care and QoL on behalf of eHealth management in pediatric settings may therefore be more difficult to achieve than in adult settings. The fact that we did not find a deterioration in HRQoL in the web group emphasizes that eHealth is not inferior to standard care.Socioeconomic Perspectives From a socioeconomic perspective, the reduced school absence and fewer outpatient visits in the web group represent an economic gain, as parents do not require leave from work and it saves the time and expense of travel to/from our hospital (because of the hospital's specialized IBD function covering a large geographic area, patients can spend 1 or 2 hours traveling to the hospital). Patients' improved school attendance might also benefit their educational achievements in the long term. Furthermore, the fewer outpatient visits and the fact that the eHealth tool can be nurse-administered (in cooperation with IBD doctors) allows for a redistribution of doctor consultations to patients with active disease.Strengths and Limitations The strength of the study is the use of a novel eHealth application in a challenging patient group, as well as the long follow-up period, which allows the study to reflect the use in a daily, nontrial setting. Patients were included from a public hospital with a dedicated IBD clinic serving patients arriving from a large geographic area and representing a diverse patient population with both severe and mild phenotypes. There is, however, a risk of selection bias, as resourceful families are more likely to participate in trials generally. The study is limited by relatively few participants that were all sourced from one center. The drop out rate during the study was 44% in the web group, 19% before and 26% after 1 year of participation. However, we did not find a difference in time to drop out when comparing the web and control groups. Reasons for drop out were as follows: change to biological treatment (web 4; control 3), wish to withdraw (web 4: control 3), change to adult care (web 1; control 1), unsafe adherence (web 2), lost computer (web 1), and emigration (control 1). The reasons for drop out are highly varied, and no systematical tendency was noted in the web group as compared with the control group. The high drop out rates in both groups may reflect the changeability of circumstances and the difficulties of completing trials among this specific age group. Finally, the study design might have gained from using a noninferior design for the statistical analysis and power calculation. The concept of the pediatric TIBS is built on the TIBS used in adult eHealth trials. [8] [9] [10] 12 The pediatric TIBS was created for this trial and has not previously been validated, which is a limitation of the study. However, the components of the TIBS-both PUCAI and abbrPCDAI-are internationally accepted and validated disease activity indices, and FC is a well-investigated inflammation marker in the management of IBD. 19, 20Perspective In the long term, eHealth may improve self-management and possibly improve the disease outcome in patients with chronic disease. 30 In line with improved self-management, eHealth monitoring might prepare patients for the transition from pediatric to adult care, where more responsibility and self-care is expected. 38 Future studies will test this hypothesis. Because of lifestyle during puberty and changing living conditions (e.g., education, traveling, and studying abroad), young patients need a flexible approach to obtaining the best health care. eHealth might offer an important opportunity to the patient to continue effective disease control without compromising a normal way of life. To further address the use of eHealth as a part of their daily IBD care, the eHealth solution www.young. constant-care.com will be implemented as a standard care option in our department. To our knowledge, this is the first implementation of eHealth monitoring as standard care. 37CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, children and adolescents with IBD can manage self-administered eHealth monitoring without risk of increased disease activity or escalated treatment. Medical adherence and HRQoL neither improved nor deteriorated during this study. School absence and costs of care were reduced. Consequently, eHealth can be safely offered to pediatric and adolescent patients with IBD. As the use of eHealth is likely to become an important part of future health care, future studies addressing the use of eHealth in larger and more varied pediatric populations should be conducted.FIGURE 1 . 1 FIGURE 1.

Evidence suggests that many patients accept and may even prefer LAI administration. 1, 2 Aripiprazole once-monthly is an LAI formulation of aripiprazole that is currently approved in the USA and Europe for the treatment of schizophrenia, and is the first dopamine partial agonist agent available in a long-acting formulation. Aripiprazole once-monthly is administered by gluteal injection and once injected, the active ingredient, aripiprazole, is slowly absorbed into the systemic circulation; there is no release vehicle or release-controlling membrane. In a previous study, aripiprazole once-monthly significantly delayed time to impending relapse compared with placebo. 3 Aripiprazole, a dopamine partial agonist, 4 is an antipsychotic with well-established efficacy and safety over the short and long term. 5 For LAI formulations, a study comparing the efficacy and safety v. the oral form is recommended to support authorisation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) 3 and to demonstrate efficacy, safety and tolerability similar to the established profile of the approved oral product. The objective of the present randomised, doubleblind, active-controlled, non-inferiority study was to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of aripiprazole once-monthly (400 mg) for the maintenance treatment of schizophrenia compared with oral aripiprazole and in comparison with a suboptimal dose of aripiprazole once-monthly (50 mg). A suboptimal dose was included to confirm assay sensitivity (i.e. to demonstrate that the study was able to differentiate an effective treatment from a less effective or ineffective intervention by demonstrating superior efficacy). Method Study design This was a 38-week, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of an intramuscular depot formulation of aripiprazole (OPC-14597) as maintenance treatment in patients with","Background Long-acting injectable formulations of antipsychotics are treatment alternatives to oral agents.Aims To assess the efficacy of aripiprazole once-monthly compared with oral aripiprazole for maintenance treatment of schizophrenia.Method A 38-week, double-blind, active-controlled, non-inferiority study; randomisation (2:2:1) to aripiprazole once-monthly 400 mg, oral aripiprazole (10-30 mg/day) or aripiprazole once-monthly 50 mg (a dose below the therapeutic threshold for assay sensitivity). (Trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov, NCT00706654.)Results A total of 1118 patients were screened, and 662 responders to oral aripiprazole were randomised. Kaplan-Meier estimated impending relapse rates at week 26 were 7.12% for aripiprazole once-monthly 400 mg and 7.76% for oral aripiprazole. This difference (70.64%, 95% CI 75.26 to 3.99) excluded the predefined non-inferiority margin of 11.5%. Treatments were superior to aripiprazole once-monthly 50 mg (21.80%, P40.001).Conclusions Aripiprazole once-monthly 400 mg was non-inferior to oral aripiprazole, and the reduction in Kaplan-Meier estimated impending relapse rate at week 26 was statistically significant v. aripiprazole once-monthly 50 mg.

The study consisted of a screening phase and three treatment phases (phases 1-3). Eligibility was determined during the screening phase (2-42 days). In treatment phase 1 (oral conversion phase, 4-6 weeks), patients were cross-titrated during weekly visits from other antipsychotic(s) to oral aripiprazole monotherapy to achieve a target dose of 10-15 mg/day. Patients receiving oral aripiprazole monotherapy for schizophrenia at screening entered the study directly at phase 2. In phase 2 (oral stabilisation phase, 8-28 weeks), patients were assessed fortnightly and stabilised on oral aripiprazole (10-30 mg/ day). Stability was defined as meeting the following criteria for 8 consecutive weeks: out-patient status; Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) 6 total score 480 and a score of 44 (moderate) on each of the following items (possible scores of 1-7 for each item): conceptual disorganisation, suspiciousness, hallucinatory behaviour, and unusual thought content; Clinical Global Impression -Severity (CGI-S) score 44 (moderately ill); 7 and Clinical Global Impression -Severity of Suicidality (CGI-SS) score 42 (mildly suicidal) on Part 1 and 45 (minimally worsened) on Part 2. The definition of stability was approved by the EMA and was similar to other stability definitions used in previous studies of approved LAIs for the treatment of schizophrenia. 8 In phase 3 (double-blind maintenance phase for up to 38 weeks), eligible patients were randomised 2:2:1 to aripiprazole once-monthly 400 mg, oral aripiprazole (10-30 mg/day) or aripiprazole once-monthly 50 mg. Aripiprazole once-monthly was administered into the gluteal muscle using a double-dummy design such that all patients, including those randomised to oral aripiprazole, received an injection. For patients randomised to aripiprazole once-monthly 400 mg or 50 mg, a one-time option to decrease to 300 mg or 25 mg, respectively, was permitted, as was a one-time return to the original assigned dose. Patients treated with aripiprazole once-monthly 400 mg or 50 mg received concomitant oral aripiprazole (10-20 mg) for 2 weeks from the date of randomisation, and then placebo tablets thereafter. This dosing strategy was based on previous pharmacokinetic studies that demonstrated that 400 and 300 mg aripiprazole oncemonthly exhibited pharmacokinetic and safety profiles similar to those of multiple, consecutive, daily oral doses of 10-30 mg aripiprazole monotherapy. 9 For patients randomised to oral aripiprazole, a one-time change in dose (increase or decrease) and a one-time reversal of the change (decrease in dose if previously increased or increase in dose if previously decreased) was permitted as long as the dose remained within the range of 10-30 mg daily. The study was conducted at 105 centres in Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Chile, Croatia, Estonia, France, Hungary, Italy, South Korea, Poland, South Africa, Thailand and the USA between 26 September 2008 and 31 August 2012. In accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, the ethics committee at each site approved the protocol. After complete description of the study to patients, written informed consent was obtained.Patients Eligible patients were aged 18-60 years and had a diagnosis of schizophrenia according to DSM-IV-TR 10 criteria for 53 years and a history of symptom exacerbation when not receiving antipsychotic treatment. Patients needed to have been responsive to antipsychotic treatment (other than clozapine) in the past year. Key exclusion criteria included a DSM-IV-TR diagnosis other than schizophrenia; uncontrolled thyroid function abnormalities; a history of seizures, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, clinically relevant tardive dyskinesia, or other medical condition that would expose the patient to undue risk or interfere with study assessments. Patients who had been admitted to hospital, including for psychosocial reasons, for 430 days total of the 90 days preceding entry into phase 1 or 2 of the study after screening were excluded. Individuals were also excluded if they met DSM-IV-TR criteria for substance dependence, including alcohol and benzodiazepines but excluding nicotine and caffeine. Additional exclusion criteria are noted in online supplement DS1.AssessmentsPrimary outcome The primary outcome was the Kaplan-Meier estimated impending relapse rate from the date of randomisation to the end of week 26. Patients were assessed for impending relapse, defined as meeting any one or more of the following specified individual criteria at any time during phase 3: (a) CGI -Improvement (CGI-I) of 55 (minimally worse) and either an increase on any of four individual PANSS items (conceptual disorganisation, hallucinatory behaviour, suspiciousness or unusual thought content) to a score 44 with an absolute increase of 52 on that specific item since randomisation, or an increase to 44 on one of those PANSS items and an absolute increase of 54 on the combined score of those items; (b) admission to hospital as a result of worsening of psychotic symptoms; (c) CGI-SS score of 4 (severely suicidal) orOther efficacy outcomes Additional efficacy outcomes included time to all-cause discontinuation following randomisation; mean change from baseline (defined as the last visit with available data prior to randomisation) in PANSS total scores 6 and CGI-S; and mean CGI-I score at end-point. 7Safety outcomes Adverse events were examined by frequency, severity, seriousness and according to whether they resulted in discontinuation from the trial. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events related to extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) were summarised by the following event categories: akathisia, dyskinetic, dystonic, Parkinsonism and residual. The following scales were also used to assess EPS: Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS), 7 Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS), 12 and Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS). 13 The CGI-SS scale and the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) were used to assess the risk of suicide events during the study. 14 Intensity of injection pain was assessed by patients using a visual analogue scale (VAS; 0 mm, no pain to 100 mm, unbearably painful 15 ) and assessed by investigators in domains of pain, swelling, redness and induration. 16 The incidence of clinically relevant changes was calculated for vital signs and routine laboratory tests. Mean change from baseline and incidence of clinically relevant changes were calculated for electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters, prolactin concentration and body weight.Statistical analyses The intent-to-treat (ITT) sample included all patients randomised to the double-blind treatment. The efficacy sample included all patients who received at least one dose of treatment and had at least one efficacy outcome assessment in the double-blind, active-controlled phase. The safety sample included all patients who were randomised to double-blind treatment and received at least one dose of treatment in the double-blind, active-controlled phase.Primary outcome (ITT sample) The primary efficacy analysis evaluated the non-inferiority of aripiprazole once-monthly 400 mg to oral aripiprazole (10-30 mg/ day) using the 95% bilateral confidence interval of the difference in estimated impending relapse rate at week 26 (from Kaplan-Meier curve estimates using the ITT population). In order to compute this confidence interval, the proportion of patients with impending relapse for each treatment group was computed using the Kaplan-Meier estimate at day 182, and its standard error was computed using the Greenwood formula. The Kaplan-Meier estimated impending relapse rates at week 26 were calculated as 1 minus the proportions of patients free of impending relapse events. Standard errors were calculated using Greenwood's formula. The 95% confidence interval of difference in the estimated impending relapse rate between aripiprazole once-monthly 400 mg and oral aripiprazole were provided using the pooled standard error with assumption of normality of the estimated difference. A similar methodology was used in computation of the z-statistic for comparison of aripiprazole once-monthly 400 mg with aripiprazole once-monthly 50 mg in the estimated impending relapse rate at week 26.Secondary efficacy outcomes Time to observed impending relapse and observed rate of impending relapse at week 38 (ITT sample). Time to observed impending relapse (based on all available relapse data through week 38) for aripiprazole once-monthly 400 mg, oral aripiprazole and aripiprazole once-monthly 50 mg was compared using the log-rank test. The observed impending relapse rates were compared between groups using the chi-squared test. Hazard ratios (and two-sided 95% confidence interval for aripiprazole once-monthly 400 mg v. oral aripiprazole and aripiprazole once-monthly 50 mg, and for oral aripiprazole v. aripiprazole once-monthly 50 mg) for risk of observed impending relapse were analysed using a Cox proportional hazard model with treatment as the factor. Responders (ITT sample) and remitters. The proportion of responders at last visit in phase 3 and the proportion of patients achieving remission were analysed using the chi-squared test. Only patients who remained in the trial for at least 6 months were included in the calculation of remission rates.Other efficacy outcomes Time to all-cause discontinuation (ITT sample). Kaplan-Meier curves for the time to discontinuation as a result of all causes were plotted and analysed using the log-rank test. PANSS, CGI-S, and CGI-I (efficacy sample, last observation carried forward and observed cases). Mean changes from baseline in PANSS total score and CGI-S score were analysed by visit using ANCOVA controlling for treatment and baseline value using last observation carried forward (LOCF). Mean CGI-I scores at week 38 were analysed using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel method based on raw mean score statistics using LOCF. Observed cases data are shown in online Table DS1 .Safety outcomes (safety sample, observed cases and LOCF) Safety outcomes, including changes from baseline in weight, metabolic parameters and EPS scale scores (BARS, AIMS, and SAS) during phase 3 were analysed using descriptive statistics (observed cases) and/or ANCOVA with treatment as a factor and baseline (score at the end of phase 2) as a covariate (LOCF). In this main report, safety outcomes are reported as observed cases; the online Table DS2 contains observed cases results for metabolic parameters; LOCF findings for safety data are reported in online Table DS3 , where available.Sample size Sample sizes were estimated to achieve approximately 93% power for the primary non-inferiority comparison at P = 0.05 (two-sided) using large sample normal approximations for the distribution of the difference in binomial proportions. It was assumed that 18% of patients would meet the criteria for an impending relapse at or before week 26 in the oral aripiprazole treatment arm. The resulting sample size was projected to be 260 patients per arm for aripiprazole once-monthly and oral aripiprazole therapies. The predefined non-inferiority margin was 11.5%. This margin was based on data from a previous trial 17 that compared relapse rates for oral aripiprazole and placebo showing estimated relapse rates of 37.4% for oral aripiprazole and 60.6% for placebo at week 26, leading to a one-sided 97.5% lower confidence interval of 15%. Given the potential adherence advantage of an LAI formulation, a conservative margin of 11.5% was selected for the current trial. Non-inferiority was demonstrated if the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval was below the predefined margin. If non-inferiority was established, comparison of aripiprazole once-monthly 400 mg with aripiprazole once-monthly 50 mg was performed by examining the difference between the estimated impending relapse rates using z-statistics for statistical significance at the 0.05 significance level (two-sided).ResultsPatient disposition and characteristics Of 1118 patients screened, 709 patients entered the oral conversion phase (phase 1) and 842 entered the oral stabilisation phase (phase 2), including 228 patients who were already receiving oral aripiprazole and entered phase 2 directly (Fig. 1 ). A total of 662 patients were randomised to double-blind treatment in phase 3 (Fig. 1 ). The number of individuals who dropped out because of adverse events was low in the aripiprazole once-monthly 400 mg group and oral aripiprazole group; the main reason for discontinuation during phase 3 was patient withdrawal of consent (Fig. 1 ). For patients receiving aripiprazole once-monthly 50 mg, the main reason for discontinuation was impending relapse with an adverse event. The ITT sample, efficacy sample, and safety sample each comprised a total of 662 patients, including 265 in the aripiprazole once-monthly 400 mg group, 266 in the oral aripiprazole group, and 131 in aripiprazole once-monthly 50 mg group. Baseline demographic and psychiatric characteristics were similar between treatment groups in the randomised population (Table 1 ). Treatment exposure data are presented in online supplement DS1.EfficacyPrimary outcome (ITT sample) Kaplan-Meier estimated impending relapse rates at week 26 were 7.12% for aripiprazole once-monthly 400 mg, 7.76% for oral aripiprazole and 21.80% for aripiprazole once-monthly 50 mg (Fig. 2a ). The difference of Kaplan-Meier estimated impending relapse rate by week 26 between aripiprazole once-monthly 400 mg and oral aripiprazole was 70.64% (95% CI 75.26 to 3.99), which confirmed non-inferiority by excluding the predefined non-inferiority margin of 11.5%. Superiority of aripiprazole once-monthly 400 mg was shown v. aripiprazole once-monthly 50 mg (P40.001 from z-statistics), confirming assay sensitivity. Observed impending relapse rates at week 26 were similar to the Kaplan-Meier estimate impending relapse rates: aripiprazole once-monthly 400 mg, 6.79% (18/265); oral aripiprazole (10-30 mg), 7.14% (19/266); aripiprazole oncemonthly 50 mg, 18.32% (24/131); confirming non-inferiority for aripiprazole once-monthly 400 mg v. oral aripiprazole (95% CI 75.06 to 4.36, P = 0.8740), and superiority v. aripiprazole oncemonthly 50 mg (95% CI 719.38 to 73.67, P = 0.0005).Secondary efficacy outcomes Time to observed impending relapse and observed rate of impending relapse at week 38 (ITT sample). Time to observed impending relapse for aripiprazole once-monthly 400 mg was similar to that for oral aripiprazole (log-rank test, P = 0.992), with both treatments demonstrating statistically significant delays in impending relapse v. aripiprazole once-monthly 50 mg (P50.0001) up to week 38 (Fig. 2b ). The proportion of observed impending relapsers and the risk of observed impending relapse at week 38 showed comparable and statistically significant benefits with aripiprazole once-monthly 400 mg v. aripiprazole oncemonthly 50 mg (P50.0001; Table 2 ).   (P = 0.0001, Table 2 ). The proportion of remitters did not show any statistically significant differences between treatment groups, although the proportion of patients remaining in the study for 6 months in the aripiprazole once-monthly 50 mg group was lower (n = 72/131, 55.0%) than in the aripiprazole once-monthly 400 mg group (n = 215/265, 81.1%) or the oral aripiprazole group (n = 201/266, 75.6%) (Table 2 ).Responders (ITT sample) andOther efficacy outcome measures Time to all-cause discontinuation (ITT sample). A statistically significant advantage on the Kaplan-Meier time to discontinuation favouring aripiprazole once-monthly 400 mg was observed v. oral aripiprazole (P50.05) and v. aripiprazole once-monthly 50 mg (P50.0001, Fig. 3a ). The all-cause discontinuation rate (a measure of effectiveness) was 25.3% (n = 67/265) for aripiprazole oncemonthly 400 mg, 32.7% (n = 87/266) for oral aripiprazole and 53.4% (n = 70/131) for aripiprazole once-monthly 50 mg. PANSS, CGI-S, and CGI-I (efficacy sample, LOCF). Symptom measures using PANSS, CGI-S and CGI-I showed statistically significant differences for aripiprazole once-monthly 400 mg v. both oral aripiprazole and aripiprazole once-monthly 50 mg (Table 2 ). Mean changes from baseline to end-point in adjusted mean PANSS total score (efficacy sample, LOCF) are shown in Fig. 3b . Statistically significant differences in mean change in PANSS total score between aripiprazole once-monthly 400 mg and oral aripiprazole were observed at weeks 10-14, 18, 26 and study end-point (P<0.05). Statistically significant differences in the aripiprazole once-monthly 400 mg group v. the aripiprazole once-monthly 50 mg group were observed at week 4 and from week 8 onwards (P50.05). Data for other efficacy end-points in the efficacy sample for observed cases can be found in online Table DS1 .Safety and tolerability (safety sample, observed cases) The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (55% in any group) are presented in Table 3 . For aripiprazole once-monthly 400 mg, insomnia, akathisia, headache and weight decrease/increase were reported by 9-12% of patients (Table 3 ). The majority of treatment-emergent adverse events reported in the randomised phase were mild or moderate in severity. During the randomised phase, serious treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in a total of 41/662 (6.2%) patients: 15/265 (5.7%) treated with aripiprazole once-monthly 400 mg; 15/266 (5.6%) treated with oral aripiprazole; and 11/131 (8.4%) treated with aripiprazole once-monthly 50 mg. Serious treatmentemergent adverse events reported in 52% of patients were only observed for patients treated with aripiprazole once-monthly 50 mg, and were psychiatric disorder (n = 4, 3.1%) and schizophrenia (n = 3, 2.3%). Two deaths were reported, one as a result of cardiac arrest in the oral aripiprazole group (15 mg dose, 51-year-old male) and one as a result of suicide in the aripiprazole once-monthly 50 mg group (44-year-old male). Neither death was considered by the investigator to be related to the trial medication. During the randomised phase, discontinuation of doubleblind medication due to treatment-emergent adverse events (including impending relapse with adverse events) was reported in 21/265 (7.9%) patients in the aripiprazole once-monthly 400 mg group, 19/266 (7.1%) patients in the oral aripiprazole 140   events (29/265, 10.9%) and Parkinsonism events (15/265, 5.7%) in the aripiprazole once-monthly 400 mg group, akathisia (18/266, 6.8%) in the oral aripiprazole group and akathisia (11/131, 8.4%) and Parkinsonism events (7/131, 5.3%) in the aripiprazole once-monthly 50 mg group. Extrapyramidal symptoms were also monitored using physician-and patient-rated scales (Table 4 ). No statistically significant differences in SAS, AIMS or BARS least squares mean score changes were observed for aripiprazole oncemonthly 400 mg v. aripiprazole once-monthly 50 mg; the difference in BARS was statistically significant for aripiprazole once-monthly 400 mg (0.06) v. oral aripiprazole (-0.05). The score for CGI-SS and the C-SSRS suicidal ideation intensity total score remained stable across treatment groups throughout the double-blind active-controlled phase (Table 4 ). See online Table DS3 for LOCF data on EPS and suicidality in the safety sample. Rates of concomitant anticholinergic use during phase 3 were 19.6% (n = 52/265; mean daily dose, 1.61 mg) for aripiprazole once-monthly 400 mg, 17.3% (n = 46/266; mean daily dose, 1.50 mg) for oral aripiprazole, and 13.7% (n = 18/131; mean daily dose, 1.66 mg) for aripiprazole once-monthly 50 mg. Concomitant benzodiazepine use data are reported in the online supplement DS1. Mean changes in body weight at week 38 of +0.1 kg (s.d. = 4.8), +1.0 kg (s.d. = 4.8), and 71.6 kg (s.d. = 7.4) for aripiprazole oncemonthly 400 mg, oral aripiprazole, and aripiprazole once-monthly 50 mg, respectively. The difference was statistically significant at week 38 (P50.05) for aripiprazole once-monthly 400 mg v. aripiprazole once-monthly 50 mg. The incidence of clinically relevant weight gain (57% increase in weight from baseline) at any time during the randomised phase was 15.9% (n = 42/264) for aripiprazole once-monthly 400 mg, 16.2% (n = 43/266) for oral aripiprazole and 6.1% (n = 8/131) for aripiprazole once-monthly 50 mg. The incidence of clinically relevant weight loss (57% decrease in weight from baseline) at any time during the randomised phase was 15.2% (n = 40/264) for aripiprazole once-monthly 400 mg, 10.2% (n = 27/266) for oral aripiprazole and 13.7% (n = 18/131) for aripiprazole once-monthly 50 mg. There were no differences in mean change in metabolic parameters, and the incidence of potentially clinically relevant new-onset metabolic parameter abnormalities was low and similar among treatment groups (online Table DS2 ). Similar findings were observed for prolactin (online Table DS2 ). There were also no clinically relevant changes in ECG parameters and no incidents of new-onset QTcF (QT interval as corrected for heart rate by Fridericia's formula) increases 4500 ms during double-blind treatment. Injection-site pain occurred in 7.5% (20/265) of patients in the aripiprazole once-monthly 400 mg group, 2.3% (6/266) of the oral aripiprazole group and 0.8% (1/131) of the aripiprazole once-monthly 50 mg group. Mean intensity of pain, measured using a patient-reported 100-point VAS scale (0 mm, no pain; 100 mm, unbearably painful) showed mild pain during the double-blind treatment phase, with reductions being reported from the first to last injection with aripiprazole once-monthly 400 mg (5.6-3.7 mm), oral aripiprazole (4.9-3.5 mm) and aripiprazole once-monthly 50 mg (3.3-2.4 mm). Absence of any pain, redness, swelling and induration by investigators' evaluations was found for the majority of patients following the first and last injections of aripiprazole once-monthly 400 mg.DiscussionMain findings The current study showed that aripiprazole once-monthly at a dose of 400 mg is non-inferior to oral aripiprazole (10-30 mg) and superior to aripiprazole once-monthly 50 mg on the primary outcome of Kaplan-Meier estimated rate of impending relapse at week 26. The secondary outcome, delay in time to observed impending relapse, was statistically significant with aripiprazole once-monthly 400 mg compared with aripiprazole once-monthly 50 mg at week 38. Also, the delay in time to all-cause discontinuation (non-primary/non-secondary outcome) was statistically significant with aripiprazole once-monthly 400 mg compared with both the oral and aripiprazole once-monthly 50 mg groups.Other findings On other (non-primary/non-secondary) efficacy measures (PANSS, CGI-S and CGI-I), there were statistically significant differences for aripiprazole once-monthly 400 mg v. both aripiprazole once-monthly 50 mg and oral aripiprazole. Although statistically significant, the clinical relevance of the absolute changes in PANSS total score is difficult to interpret. Prior 142 research on the association between CGI-S and PANSS scores suggests that a mild CGI-S score (i.e. 3) corresponds with a PANSS total score of 55-62, 18 indicating that at baseline in the doubleblind, active-controlled phase of the current study, patients demonstrated mild symptoms across treatment groups. Prior research also indicates that no change on the CGI-I (i.e. CGI-I score of 4) corresponds with PANSS percentage change score reductions of 2-3%. 18 Thus, in the current study, the statistically significant treatment differences favouring aripiprazole oncemonthly 400 mg v. oral aripiprazole and aripiprazole once-monthly 50 mg in PANSS total score may be of minimal clinical relevance (treatment differences in least square mean change scores ranged from ~2 to 5 points) because the overall disease severity of patients in all three groups was relatively unchanged. Modest changes in PANSS may be consistent with clinical expectations for patients who were already stabilised with oral aripiprazole therapy. The safety profile of aripiprazole once-monthly was comparable with oral aripiprazole and consistent with that reported for oral aripiprazole in previous registrational maintenance studies. 3, 17, 19 The safety profile reported here is also consistent with data from another maintenance study of aripiprazole once-monthly 400 mg v. placebo. 3 Metabolic changes, weight changes and EPS-related changes were generally comparable across registrational maintenance studies of both oral and once-monthly formulations. The clinical relevance of the statistically significant change in BARS global score observed at week 38 with aripiprazole once-monthly 400 mg v. oral aripiprazole in the current study is unknown. In general, the overall rates of treatment-emergent adverse events, including akathisia, were lower in the maintenance study reported by Kane et al, 3 possibly because of the study design, which required patients to be stabilised on aripiprazole once-monthly for 3 months prior to randomisation. There was no requirement for stabilisation on once-monthly aripiprazole prior to randomisation in the current study. As previously observed, 3 injections were well tolerated; numerically higher rates of injection-site pain treatment-emergent adverse events were observed for aripiprazole once-monthly 400 mg compared with aripiprazole once-monthly 50 mg; however, across all treatment groups, patients reported mild injection pain, with reductions in self-reported injection pain scores from the first to last injection.Advantages and disadvantages of LAIs Recent guideline updates from the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry 20 suggest that the potential advantages of LAI antipsychotics v. oral antipsychotics include improved adherence to treatment, avoidance of gastrointestinal absorption problems and circumvention of first-pass hepatic metabolism. Potential disadvantages of LAIs include diminished flexibility of administration, potential for injection-site reactions and delayed attenuation of adverse effects after treatment discontinuation. 20 The potential benefit of aripiprazole once-monthly 400 mg over the oral and 50 mg dose on time to all-cause discontinuation complements a recent large national cohort study in Finland of 2588 patients admitted to hospital with newly diagnosed schizophrenia, which found that patients treated with LAIs had a lower risk of readmissions to hospital in comparison with those treated with oral formulations of the same antipsychotic medications. 21 In contrast, a controlled clinical study in the USA reported rates of readmission that were comparable between LAI risperidone and any oral antipsychotic therapy. 22 Recent meta-analyses suggest that differences between oral and LAI formulations are less likely to be found in controlled clinical trials where adherence is enhanced owing to multiple clinic visits and more likely to be observed in naturalistic studies. 23, 24Limitations In the current study, treatment initiation of aripiprazole oncemonthly in the randomised phase was carried out in patients who had been stabilised with oral aripiprazole. However, in clinical practice, patients may be switched directly from their current oral antipsychotic to an LAI antipsychotic. This difference from real-life clinical populations may limit the generalisability of our findings. The study population was also limited to patients with chronic schizophrenia of mild severity, which may have contributed to the low rates of relapse and may also limit the generalisability of our findings. Also, because of the very low initial relapse rates, the primary outcome was adjusted (as approved by the EMA; see online supplement DS1) from time to observed impending relapse at week 38 to Kaplan-Meier estimated relapse rates at week 26, because time as a variable can have a disproportional impact on time to events when event rates are low. Revising the primary outcome after the trial started may have introduced some bias; however, the total impending relapse events remained low for the duration of the study, the estimated sample size was slightly increased and non-inferiority v. oral aripiprazole was clearly demonstrated. In addition, the study did not consider the potential for multiple testing concerns, which may have limited the strength of the prespecified statistical analysis plan for secondary and other efficacy outcomes. Another potential limitation is that our trial may not have been long enough to fully detect potential differences between the oncemonthly and the oral formulations of aripiprazole.ScreeningFig. 1 1 Fig.1Patient flow throughout the study.

In this open-label, 28-week, randomized controlled trial, stable patients with schizophrenia treated with risperidone or olanzapine were randomly assigned to the reduction group (dose reduced by 50% in 4 weeks and then maintained) or maintenance group (dose kept constant). Assessments at baseline and week 28 included the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS), Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), and Drug-Induced Extrapyramidal Symptoms Scale (DIEPSS). Sixty-one patients were enrolled; 2 of 31 (6.5%) and 5 of 30 (16.7%) patients prematurely withdrew from the study in the reduction and maintenance groups, respectively. While no significant differences in change in the PANSS total score were observed between the 2 groups, the reduction group showed significantly greater improvements in the RBANS and DIEPSS total scores compared with the maintenance group (mean ± SD, +7.0 ± 7.1 vs -0.1 ± 8.0, P < .001; -0.9 ± 1.7 vs +0.1 ± 1.2, P = .010, respectively). This 6-month pilot study suggests that risperidone or olanzapine dose reduction of 50% can improve cognitive function for stable patients with schizophrenia. Due to the open-label design, small sample size, and short study duration, however, there is a need to confirm the finding through double-blind, larger scale trials with longer follow-up periods. Moreover, potential risks of relapse following antipsychotic dose reduction should be thoroughly investigated in longer term studies.","Introduction While the effects of antipsychotic drugs on cognitive function remain controversial in patients with schizophrenia, 1 excessive dopaminergic blockade has been related to cognitive impairment 2 as well as extrapyramidal symptoms. 3 In fact, recent studies have reported that higher dose of antipsychotics impairs cognitive function in patients with schizophrenia, 4, 5 even treated with atypical antipsychotics. 6 However, to date there has been no clinical trial that has evaluated the effects of atypical antipsychotic dose reduction on cognitive function in patients with schizophrenia. To address this gap in the literature, we conducted an open-label, 28-week, randomized, controlled, pilot study investigating the impact of risperidone and olanzapine dose reduction on cognitive function in stable patients with schizophrenia.MethodsStudy Design and Setting This pilot study represented a multicenter, open-label, parallel-group, 28-week, randomized, controlled trial. It was conducted at 6 psychiatric hospitals and clinics inH. Takeuchi et al Tokyo from April 2009 to August 2011. The trial protocol was approved by the institutional review board at each participating site. After full description of the study, all participants provided written informed consent prior to entering the study. This trial was registered at UMIN Clinical Trials Registry (UMIN-CTR) on March 2009 (UMIN000001834).Patients Patients were included if they were ≥18 years, diagnosed with schizophrenia according to DSM-IV, 7 receiving a stable dose of either risperidone >2 mg/day or olanzapine >5 mg/day as antipsychotic monotherapy for at least 3 months, and in remission with respect to positive symptoms, as defined by a score of ≤3 (mild) on all of the following 4 Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) 8 Positive subscale items: delusion (P1), conceptual disorganization (P2), hallucinatory behavior (P3), and suspiciousness (P6). Patients on antipsychotic polypharmacy were excluded, although concomitant use of ≤50 mg/day of chlorpromazine or levomepromazine was allowed because these medications are often used as hypnotics in Japan, and it was considered that such low doses would not be associated with antipsychotic effects. Concomitant medications other than antipsychotics were allowed. Patients were also excluded if they suffered from any significant medical or neurological illnesses, or were pregnant or lactating.Procedures Patients who met inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to either the reduction or maintenance groups by central randomization stratified by their antipsychotics type (ie, risperidone or olanzapine). In the reduction group, risperidone or olanzapine were reduced by 25% at baseline and week 4, followed by the treatment with half the baseline dose over the next 24 weeks. For safety reasons, the dose was not reduced beyond the lower limit of the dose range recommended for maintenance treatment of schizophrenia, ie, 2 mg/day for risperidone and 5 mg/day for olanzapine. 9 In the maintenance group, patients received the same regimen for the entire 28 weeks. For each treatment arm, concomitant medications, including anticholinergic drugs, were kept constant throughout the study period. Due to the nature of open-label study design, both patients and raters were not blind to patients' group assignment.Outcome Measures The following assessments were performed at baseline and 28 weeks: the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) 10, 11 for cognitive function; the PANSS, the Clinical Global Impression-Severity scale (CGI-S), 12 and the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS) 13 for clinical psychopathology; and, the Drug-Induced Extrapyramidal Symptoms Scale (DIEPSS) 14 for extrapyramidal symptoms. In this study, relapse was defined as a score of ≥4 (moderate) on at least one of the 4 PANSS Positive subscale items identified: delusion (P1), conceptual disorganization (P2), hallucinatory behavior (P3), and suspiciousness (P6).Statistical Analyses Statistical analyses were performed on an intentionto-treat basis. The primary outcome was change in RBANS Total scale scores. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were compared between the 2 groups by the Fisher's exact test for categorical variables and by the Student's t test for continuous variables. The between-group differences in changes at last visit from baseline in all the efficacy endpoints were tested by the Student's t test using a last observation carried forward (LOCF) method as a primary analysis. A 2-tailed P value of <.05 was considered statistically significant for all tests. All statistical analyses were conducted using the IBM SPSS Statistics version 19 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY).Results A total of 61 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to the reduction group (n = 31) or the maintenance group (n = 30). A total of 54 patients completed all study procedures; 2 and 5 patients prematurely withdrew from the study in the reduction group (6.5%) and the maintenance group (16.7%), respectively; this did not represent a statistically significant difference (Figure 1 ).Patient Characteristics Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients are shown in Tables 1 and 2 . There were no statistical differences in any baseline values between the 2 groups (Tables 1 and 2 ). In the reduction group, 10 patients (32.3%) received an antipsychotic dose reduction of less than 50%; each received a dose reduction of onethird, in keeping with the position that dose reduction was not performed beyond the lower limit of the recommended dose range (ie, risperidone 2 mg/day or olanzapine 5 mg/day), as described in ""Methods"" section.Cognitive Function A significantly greater improvement in the RBANS Total scale score was observed in the reduction vs maintenance group (Table 2 ), and effect size (Cohen's d) for the endpoint was large, .95 (P < .001). When patients who took anticholinergic drugs were excluded, a significant difference was also found between the reduction group (n = 16, mean ± SD = +8.1 ± 7.7) and the maintenance Risperidone and Olanzapine Dose Reduction and Cognition group (n = 22, mean ± SD = -1.6 ± 7.8) (P < .001). No significant difference was found between the patients undergoing a one-half and a one-third reduction. Exploratory analyses for the 5 cognitive domains revealed significant improvements in the Immediate Memory and Language index scores in the reduction group compared with the maintenance group (Table 2 ), although improvement in the Immediate Memory index score failed to remain significant after Bonferroni correction (ie, P value multiplied by 5).  No significant differences in all values between the 2 groups.H. Takeuchi et alClinical Psychopathology and Extrapyramidal Symptoms Only 1 patient in each group met criteria for relapse. No significant differences between the 2 groups were found in overall changes from baseline to last visit on the PANSS Total, Positive or General Psychopathology subscale scores, as well as the CGI-S and CDSS (Table 2 ). On the other hand, a significant reduction in the PANSS Negative subscale score was observed in the reduction group compared with the maintenance group (Table 2 ), although it failed to remain significant after Bonferroni correction (ie, P value multiplied by 3). As expected, the DIEPSS total score decreased significantly in the reduction group compared with the maintenance group (Table 2 ).Discussion To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the impact of atypical antipsychotic dose reduction on cognitive function in stabilized patients with schizophrenia. Our preliminary findings are 2-fold: (1) cognitive function can be improved by reducing the doses of risperidone and olanzapine and (2) dose reduction of risperidone and olanzapine did not increase the risk of worsening in clinical psychopathology over a 6month interval in patients who currently do not demonstrate significant positive symptoms. Most notably, a simple dose reduction strategy resulted in significant improvements in cognitive function; moreover, the effect size of general cognitive improvement between groups was large, ie, .95. This is striking when one considers that clinical trials for cognitive enhancers in schizophrenia have demonstrated only modest efficacy or failed to show a separation from placebo, 15 and highlights the potential of dose reduction as a strategy that may be effective through minimizing antipsychotic-induced cognitive impairment. Other studies have reported that dose is inversely correlated with general cognitive function 4, 6 as well as specific cognitive domains such as processing speed 5 and verbal learning in patients receiving risperidone or olanzapine. 6 Our results are consistent with these findings; both verbal memory and processing speed were improved by reducing antipsychotic dose. This said, the point has been made that a single generalized cognitive score should be used because specified domains do not exist independently. 16 From this perspective, the improvement in the RBANS Total scale score in the reduction group also endorses the benefits of this strategy in enhancing cognition. From a mechanistic point of view, cognitive improvement following antipsychotic dose reduction may be a product of decreased dopamine D 2 receptor blockade. This notion is in line with our recent cross-sectional analysis, using the data from the CATIE study, whichRisperidone and Olanzapine Dose Reduction and Cognition demonstrated impaired general cognitive function in patients with antipsychotic-related high estimated D 2 receptor occupancy. 2 Another possible mechanism is that of anticholinergic activity, which is also associated with cognitive impairment, especially in the domains of attention and memory. 17 Regardless of mechanism, though, findings underscore the need for using the lowest possible antipsychotic dose, typical or atypical, to minimize or prevent such cognitive side effects. The risk of worsening in clinical psychopathology was not increased after dose reduction, at least over an interval of 6 months. This favorable result may be due to the inclusion of clinically stable patients without significant positive symptoms (ie, scores ≤3 on P1, P2, P3, and P6). In addition, our study did not allow for a dose decrease beyond the lower limit of currently recommended doses (ie, risperidone 2 mg/day or olanzapine 5 mg/day). Indeed, our recent meta-analysis revealed that the efficacy of moderately low and standard doses are comparable in preventing relapse in schizophrenia, while less than half the standard dose may increase the risk of relapse. 18 Thus, low-dose strategies are effective in maintenance treatment although there still may remain a lower threshold beyond which risk of relapse rises. There are limitations related to the present study that warrant comment. First, the open-label design could have influenced results; more specifically, the cognitive improvement in the reduction group may have been attributable to patients' and raters' expectation bias. Second, the follow-up period of 6 months may be too short to assess long-term outcomes, especially relapse rates, in schizophrenia. In fact, while one previous 6-month study reported no increase in relapse after approximately a 25% dose reduction of olanzapine, 19 a 1-year study did demonstrate an increase in relapse after a 50% dose reduction of risperidone. 20 In addition, previous longer term randomized controlled trials of typical antipsychotic dose reduction have shown that the relapse rates keep gradually increasing also beyond 6 months although the doses were reduced to one-fifth or less in those studies. [21] [22] [23] Third, the sample size was small, which did not allow us to separately analyze the data for risperidone and olanzapine. Finally, medication adherence was assessed based on clinical interview at each visit without any objective measures such as pill count or electronic monitoring. Going forward, doubleblind, larger scale, and longer term trials are needed to replicate our findings. In conclusion, a 50% dose reduction in risperidone or olanzapine improved cognitive function without increasing risk of worsening in clinical psychopathology in stabilized patients with schizophrenia over 6 months in this pilot study. This highlights the fact that risperidone and olanzapine can induce cognitive impairment in a dosedependent fashion, although these preliminary findings should be confirmed in further studies.Fig. 1 . 1 Fig. 1.

Methods: The program included home visits by nurses or care managers every 3 months for 24 months, with a systematic assessment of care needs to prevent functional decline. Eligible participants (N = 360) were randomly assigned to the visit (VG: n = 179) or control group (CG: n = 181). Functional parameters were gathered via mail questionnaires at baseline and at 12-and 24-month follow-ups. Care-need levels in the LTCI were obtained at 12-, 24-, and 36-month follow-ups and the utilization of the LTCI service through 36 months. Results: Participants in VG were significantly more likely to maintain their activities of daily living (ADL) functioning (p = .0113) and less likely to increase care-needs level, compared with CG participants, over 24 months. A generalized linear model showed that the estimate of the effect on increase in care-needs level (ie, functional decline) was -0.53 (p = .042) over 36 months. Conclusions: These results suggest that the updated preventive home visit program could be effective for the prevention of ADL and careneeds deterioration, and these effects could continue up to 1 year after program completion.","Frailty in older adults is a clinical state of heightened risk for developing dependency requiring multidimensional care and death when exposed to a stressor (1, 2) . Preventive home visits (PHVs) remain as a practical strategy for maintaining independence in frail older adults living at home (2) (3) (4) (5) . Although a few meta-analyses or systematic reviews have questioned the efficacy of PHVs (6) (7) (8) , conclusions of these reviews are based on examination of a heterogeneous group of studies that vary greatly in design (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) , and various models have been suggested as being most effective (9) . Japan, an aging society with 25.1% of its adult population aged 65 years or older in 2013 (10) , has been operating a public Long-term Care Insurance (LTCI) system since 2000 (11) . Using funds from the LTCI system, community-based integrated centers were established in every district with municipalities of approximately 20,000 residents. They provide outreach with home visits and preventive benefit care management to ambulatory frail older adults certified at the two lowest care-need levels (Support Level 1 or 2) (12) . We have developed and implemented for over a decade an evolving PHV program model, which includes outreach home visits to frail ambulatory older adults in community-based care settings (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) . In our previous randomized controlled trial, we showed that an early design of the PHV program was ineffective (14) (15) (16) , possibly due to the long interval between visits (6 months) or to the fact that the clinical recommendations did not focus on the prevention of functional decline in older adults (15) . The findings of the previous study led to modification of the PHV program including the use of a systematic structured needs' assessment and an increase in home visits' frequency to every 3 months for 24 months (17) . The aim of the present randomized controlled trial was to determine the effects on functional parameters of the updated PHV program over 24 months in ambulatory frail older adults certified at the two lowest care-need levels in the Japanese LTCI system. In order to confirm the long-term effects of the PHV program, we followed up care-need levels as well as the utilization of LTCI service for an additional 12-month period after the PHV program ended.MethodsProcedure and Participants The study design comprised a single-blind randomized controlled trial. Study settings, derivation of study participants, intervention protocol, and measurements were as described previously (17) . The PHV program was provided from October 2011 to September 2013 to participants in the visit group (VG). Participant surveys of functional parameters were conducted via mail questionnaires at baseline (ie, July 2011) and at 12-(ie, September 2012) and 24-(ie, September 2013) month follow-ups. We obtained data on care-need levels in the LTCI at 12-, 24-, and 36-month (ie, September 2014) follow-ups, as well as the monthly costs of the LTC service through 36 months from local government records. The present population-based study was carried out in three suburban municipalities in Osaka, Japan: Daito (population at April 2011 = 126,701), Sennan (64,186), and Misaki (17, 268) . A total of 1,068 potential participants identified from the three local government records in May 2011, aged 65 years or older who were certified as being at Support Level 1 (less frail) or 2 (more frail), were included in the baseline survey (17) . (Persons in Support Levels 1 and 2 were typically ambulatory, without serious cognitive disorder, with little difficulty in IADLs in general, and ineligible for facility-based care in the LTCI.) After the baseline survey, 505 individuals were enrolled excluding participants who did not respond, returned invalid responses, were certified with a Care Level, were institutionalized, were hospitalized, or died during the survey. From these 505 individuals, 360 potential study participants were randomly extracted in order to enroll approximately 60 participants to the intervention in each community based on sample size estimates described elsewhere (17) (Figure 1 ). Using computer-generated random numbers, stratified on the basis of gender, age group, and community, these 360 participants were randomized to either the visit group (VG) allocated to the updated PHV program (n = 179) or the control group (CG; n = 181). At each follow-up time points, both the VG and CG lost a few participants due to death or moving out the area. Data regarding care-need levels or service utilization in the LTCI system were analyzed only for participants who remained in their respective follow-up groups (ie, excluding those lost to follow-up due to death or moving) at each time point or monthly over 36 months. Data from mail surveys were analyzed for participants who were living at home, hospitalized, or institutionalized at each time point. The response rates in the VG and CG at 12-and 24-month follow-ups based on the number of baseline participants were 154 (86.0%) versus 151 (83.4%) and 138 (77.1%) versus 142 (78.5%), respectively. We informed participants about the survey and study overview via mail at baseline survey. We obtained both oral and written informed consents from participants in VG. The study was approved by the Nursing Research Ethical Committee of Osaka City University (no. 23-3-4, June 22, 2011) . The study protocol was registered in the UMIN Clinical Trials Registry approved by International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (no. UMIN000006463, October 4, 2011).Outcome Measures Primary outcome measures included functional parameters at 12and 24-month follow-ups and care-need levels in the LTCI system at 12, 24, and 36 months. Secondary outcome measures included LTC service utilizations over the 36-month period. Functional parameters included activities of daily living (ADLs), instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), depression, cognitive capacity, daily life satisfaction related to social activities, and selfefficacy for health promotion. In addition, we asked about the occurrence of any health-related events in the past year which could affect functional parameters, including falls, hospitalizations, or death of a family member. ADLs were measured by a self-rated form based on the Barthel Index (18) , a well-known scale with established reliability and validity, with ADL scores ranging from 0 to 100. IADLs were measured by the Index of Competence developed by the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology (19) , which consists of 13 items. The response to each item is given a score of either 1 for ""yes"" or 0 for ""no"" (range 0-13). High scores for instrumental self-maintenance indicate relatively high levels of ADL and IADL functioning. Depression was measured by the Japanese translation (20) of the 5-item Geriatric Depression Scale (21) , which is widely used in Japan. High scores (range 0-5) indicate worsening depression. Cognitive capacity was assessed by the capacity subscale of the short Japanese version (22) of the Metamemory in Adulthood Questionnaire (23, 24) . It contains seven items, asking respondents to rate their agreement with statements on memory capacity. High scores (range 5-35) indicate a high level of self-reported confidence in cognitive capacity; the mean score reported for healthy older Japanese is 20.0 (22) . (Although the subscale has not yet been validated for performance-based cognitive function tests, memory complaints including confidence could be an early sign of cognitive function decline (25) ). Daily life satisfaction related to social activities was measured by the Social Activities-Related Life Satisfaction Scale (26) , which has previously shown sufficient validity and internal consistency. It contains 14 items, and high scores (range 14-70) indicate a high degree of satisfaction from social activities. Self-efficacy for health promotion was measured by the 15-item Self-Efficacy for Health Promotion Scale (27) . Items include daily activities related to general health promotion. Each item is given a score ranging from 1 for ""not confident at all"" to 4 for ""very confident"" (range 15-60). Local governments certify care-need levels in the LTCI system according to a national standardized computer-aided system that calculates estimated care time, after comprehensive examinations by independent investigators hired by each local government. Careneed levels consist of seven categories, starting with Support Level 1 or 2 and Care Level 1 (less disabled) to 5 (most disabled). The criteria for estimated care time for Support Level 1 is less than 25 minutes, whereas the estimated times for Support Level 2, Care Level 1, Care Level 2, Care Level 3, Care Level 4, and Care Level 5 are 25-32, 25-32, 50-70, 70-90, 90-110, and more than 110 minutes, respectively. The estimated care times for Support Level 2 and Care Level 1 are the same, and the care-need levels are determined by certificate board member discussions in each local government based on narrative descriptions of the examination and estimated care time. Typically, individuals in Care Levels 1-5 have dementia or are chair-or bed-bound, and individuals certified as Care Level 3-5 are eligible for admission to nursing facilities offering constant care. We collected data related to these seven categories and calculated the frequency of decline to Care Level 1-5 from Support Levels 1 or 2 at baseline. We also collected data related to the monthly costs of LTC service utilization, including facility-based and home-based care.Interventions Routine PHVs were provided every 3 months for 24 months by community care nurses, social workers, or care managers who worked at all six community-based integrated centers in the three municipalities. PHVs were conducted with rigorous recommendations, based on a systematic structured assessment sheet of care needs, including four domains: health, mental health, activities, and participation (17) . After assessing care needs and client and/or family care preference, comprehensive recommendations were made, which included ""sustain self-care,"" ""need observation or supervision from visitors,"" and ""need continuous or long-term health care"" (17) . PHVs over the period were implemented for the majority of participants living at home in VG (first visit, 87.7%; second, 79.3%; third, 78.1%; fourth, 70.8%; fifth, 73.6%; sixth, 72.0%; seventh, 70.1%; and eighth, 74.0%), and additional visits were not conducted. Participants in the CG received the usual care in the Japanese LTCI system, which includes unstructured visits from communitybased integrated centers, every 3 months to individuals utilizing home-based LTC services. The same visitors could see participants in both the VG and CG but did not use assessment sheets for those individuals in the CG. Visitors of community-based integrated centers could know the group allocation, but investigators related to certification of careneed levels were blinded.Statistical Analysis All analyses were conducted by intention to treat (including participants who declined PHVs), using SAS version 9.4, with a two-tailed probability level less than .05 indicating statistical significance. To demonstrate the effect size of .50 on outcome parameters (ADLs and IADLs), 180 participants per group were required, as described previously (17) . In order to compare the changes in continuous variables related to functional parameters over time between groups, we performed two-way repeated analysis of covariance using PROC MIXED in SAS procedure, adjusting for each baseline score to test both groups and the interaction of ""Group × Time"" effect. To compare the rate of occurrence in health-related events between groups at 12-and 24-month follow-ups, chi-square tests or Fisher's exact tests were conducted. To determine the effect on care-need level decline between groups, estimates over 36 months, and odds ratios at each follow-up, we performed a generalized linear model utilizing logit function, with dependent variables including 1 for ""remaining at Support Level or uncertified"" and 0 for ""declining to Care Level"" and independent variables including group and time point. A mean of the total LTC service costs per person over the study period was compared between groups, utilizing the t test after log transformation. Average LTC service costs per person per 3 months were calculated for each group.ResultsCharacteristics of Participants at Baseline Table 1 shows the characteristics of participants at baseline. The mean age was 79.2 years. About 75% of the study population was women, and about half was in each Support Levels 1 and 2. Primary Outcomes: Functional Parameters and Care-need Levels in the LTCI System The number of participants who died over 36 months were 22 (12.3%) in VG and 17 (9.4%) in CG, with no statistically significant difference between the groups. Changes in functional parameters over 24 months are shown in Table 2 . Two-way repeated analysis of covariance, adjusting for each baseline score of functional parameters, showed that ADLs in CG participants were significantly worse over time, compared with VG participants (F value of ""Group × Time"" effect = 4.52, p = .011). However, daily life satisfaction related to social activities in VG participants was significantly worse, compared with CG participants (F value of ""Group × Time"" effect = 3.25, p = .040). We performed the sensitivity analysis including participants (n = 280) who were living at home, hospitalized, or institutionalized at 24-month follow-up in the same way. It also showed that ADLs in CG participants were worse over time, compared with VG participants (F value of ""Group × Time"" effect = 3.82, p = .022), but daily life satisfaction related to social activities in VG participants was worse, compared with CG participants (F value of ""Group × Time"" effect = 4.30, p = .014). Analysis of the events which could affect functional parameters revealed the rates of falls occurring in the prior year in each group: 24.7% (n = 38) for VG (n = 154) and 27.8% (n = 42) for CG (n = 151) at 12-month follow-up (n.s.), and 29.7% (n = 41) for VG (n = 138) and 33.8% (n = 48) for CG (n = 142) at 24-month follow-up (n.s.). Rates of hospitalization in the prior year in each group were 16.9% (n = 26) for VG and 15.9% (n = 24) for CG at 12-month follow-up (n.s.), and 18.8% (n = 26) for VG and 25.3% (n = 36) for CG at 24-month follow-up (n.s.). Rates of death of a family member in the prior year in each group were 9.1% (n = 14) for VG and 5.3% (n = 8) for CG at 12-month follow-up (n.s.), and 5.8% (n = 8) for VG and 5.6% (n = 8) for CG at 24-month followup (n.s.). Figure 2 shows the percentage changes of participants who were certified as Care Level (disabled) at follow-ups from Support Level (frail) at baseline in the LTCI system. According to the generalized linear model utilizing logit function, estimate for the effect on careneed level increase crossing from Support Level to Care Level over the study period was -0.53 (SE = 0.26, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -1.03 to -0.01, p = .042), and the odds ratios of VG, compared with CG, were 1.01 (95% CI = 0.54 to 2.17, n.s.) at 12 months, 0.56 (95% CI = 0.32 to 0.96, p = .037) at 24 months, and 0.59 (95% CI = 0.35 to 0.98, p = .042) at 36 months.Secondary Outcomes: LTC Service Utilization No statistically significant differences in total LTC service costs per person over 36 months between VG and CG groups were obtained (mean credits [SD]: VG = 3,507 [5, 400] , CG = 3,562 [5,066], n.s.). Supplementary Figure 1 shows the mean of LTC service costs and those in both groups increased over the study period. Supplementary Table 1 shows changes in mean LTC service utilization rates, which increased slightly in both groups over the study period. At least 61%-66.9% of participants in the CG received unstructured routine home visits in the LTCI system every 3 months from community-based integrated centers during the study period.Discussion This randomized controlled trial suggests that the PHV program with rigorous recommendations, based on the systematic structured assessment of care needs of ambulatory frail elderly individuals living at home, was effective for the prevention of decline in ADL functioning and increase in care-need level, and remained effective for the prevention of care-needs increase 1 year after PHV program completion. Because ADLs or care-need level are considered as one of strongest outcome measures related to quality of life in the elderly population, most intervention studies have targeted such measures (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) . Although the present PHV program has been updated from a previous randomized controlled trial (14) (15) (16) which was not effective for functional outcomes, including ADLs or care-need level, we could interpret the results as follows: First, the positive effects of the present PHV program on ADLs could be explained by the fact that the program had a more structured assessment as well as an initiating recommendation sheet provided by each home visitor, compared with the previous program (14 -16) . Our results are consistent with those from a recent metaanalysis showing that an intervention program with multidimensional assessment could be effective for the prevention of functional status decline (4). The recommendation sheet used in our study was designed to be as simple as possible, setting recommendations from mainly eight care-needs domains. Simple recommendation sheets are helpful in terms of feasibility, as well as to facilitate explicit clinical thinking, as home visitors are able to focus on formulating recommendations rather than complex paperwork. Second, the effectiveness of the present study could be explained by a higher frequency of planned PHVs, that is, every 3 months, for 24 months, compared with previous PHVs provided every 6 months, although the visit frequency did not relate to the effects of PHV, according to a previous meta-analysis (4) . Three-monthly visits could provide continuous recommendations to participants. However, visit compliance decreased from 87.2% at the first visit to 70.1% at the eighth visit. Of note, visit compliance remained at approximately 70% after the fourth visit. In contrast, a previous study (15) showed visit compliance remaining mostly constant, from 87.0% to 83.9%, over 24 months. It is possible that participants thought their functions had stabilized and therefore declined further 3-monthly PHVs. Third, our findings suggest that the impact of PHVs on careneed level was effective at 24 months, lasting up to 1 year after completion of the PHV program. Although we did not find any further evidence regarding the long-term lasting effects of PHVs, we could recommend providing PHVs for at least 24 months. Clinically, it is important to emphasize the important implication of a decline to Care Level from Support Level in frail elderly people, as those certified as Care Level have a higher risk of mortality (28) . However, our PHV program was not effective in several other areas. First, there were no significant differences in the increase in LTC service cost and utilization between the two groups over the study period. It is possible that home visitors recommended LTC service utilization to participants in the present study in both groups, as well as the ambulatory frail elderly participants who did not use the LTC service at baseline in the previous study (15) . Second, our results showed that daily life satisfaction related to social activities in VG was somewhat worse than that in CG over the study period. One possible explanation is that participants in VG experienced a somewhat higher rate of death in their families, compared with those in CG, although this was not statistically significant. Such specific events can have a negative impact on psychological health and might be difficult to be addressed by the present PHV program. In addition, function-deficit-focused visits from the a Comparing changes from baseline to follow-up between groups: two-way repeated analysis of covariance, adjusting for each baseline score. Elderly adults who were certified as Care Level were more severely disabled than Support Level adults in the LTCI system. Participants who had died or moved out the area were excluded at 36-month follow-up. Visit group vs control group n = 149 vs n = 157. Estimating the effect of PHVs, according to a generalized linear model, over the study period, with independent variables including 0 = remain at Support Level or uncertified and 1 = decline to Care Level. Estimate = -0.53, SE = 0.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) = -1.03 to -0.01, p = .042. Odds ratio at 12-month follow-up = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.54 to 2.17, p = .817. Odds ratio at 24-month follow-up = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.32 to 0.96, p = .037. Odds ratio at 36-month follow-up = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.35 to 0.98, p = .042. formal care system might have negative effects on these perceptions. Further research on this PHV model might include self-care efficacy for social activities that might also be sensitive to large doses of PHVs of this sort. Lastly, the present PHV program had no effect on mortality, which is in agreement with results from other studies (4, 5) . The mean age of study participants at baseline was 79.2 years, which would make life prolongation a goal difficult to achieve (6) . The process of participants' death might be investigated as an outcome of PHVs in future studies, as one of the aims of PHVs includes optimizing quality of life during the end of life, as well as prevention of functional decline. The present study has several limitations. First, because the surveys were conducted via mail and self-reported, participants having problems (ie, cognitive impairment) might not complete the survey or provide inaccurate information related to cognitive function, medical condition, or hospitalizations. Second, home visitors could provide a similar type of PHV assessment to participants in CG even though they did not use structured sheet. Third, relationships between compliance with recommendations during the PHV and effects should be clarified in future analysis. Lastly, the present intervention could be categorized as ""outreach home visits"" (9) focusing on needs assessment rather than clinical care. Future programs could be built based on primary or medical care settings, targeting illness management that involves physicians or advanced nurses (29) , which might prove more effective for improving major clinical outcomes. We conclude that our PHV program with rigorous recommendations, based on the systematic structured assessment of care-needs, could be beneficially applied in clinical practice for the prevention of functional decline among ambulatory frail elderly people living at home.Figure 1 . 1 Figure 1.

Methods: This was a stratified randomized trial. There were 791 participants, community-dwelling people in Bern, Switzerland, older than 75 years. The participants' risk status was based on 6 baseline predictors of functional deterioration. The intervention consisted of annual multidimensional assessments and quarterly follow-up in-home visits by 3 public health nurses (nurses A, B, and C), who, in collaboration with geriatricians, evaluated problems, gave recommendations, facilitated adherence with recommendations, and provided health education. Each nurse was responsible for conducting the home visits in 1 ZIP code area. Results: After 3 years, surviving participants at low baseline risk in the intervention group were less dependent in instrumental activities of daily living (ADL) compared with controls (odds ratio, 0.6; 95% confidence interval, 0.3-1.0; P = .04). Among subjects at high base-line risk, there were no favorable intervention effects on ADL and an unfavorable increase in nursing home admissions (P = .02). Despite the similar health status of subjects, nurse C identified fewer problems in the subjects who were visited compared with those assessed by nurses A and B. Subgroup analysis revealed that among low-risk subjects visited by nurses A and B, the intervention had favorable effects on instrumental ADL (P = .005) and basic ADL (P = .009), reduced nursing home admissions (P = .004), and resulted in net cost savings in the third year (US $1403 per person per year). Among low-risk subjects visited by nurse C, the intervention had no favorable effects. Conclusions: These data suggest that this intervention can reduce disabilities among elderly people at low risk but not among those at high risk for functional impairment, and that these effects are likely related to the home visitor's performance in conducting the visits.","T HE INCREASING health and social care services required by disabled older persons will be a growing burden and a major societal concern. 1, 2 One possible means of coping with this development would be to devise and implement strategies for detecting and modifying biological, psychological, social, and environmental risk factors for disabilities in order to prevent or delay their onset. 3 Several investigators have developed and tested preventive home visitation programs in community-dwelling older people as a strategy for delaying the development of disabilities and reducing nursing home admissions in older people. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] Although some studies have shown favorable effects on health status and health care use in older people, 4, 6, [8] [9] [10] 12 others have not. 5, 7, 11 Some of the discrepancies in these findings might be explained by differences in the design of the preventive interventions, such as the duration and intensity of the home visits. 13 However, other factors might also explain the variable study findings. First, it is uncertain whether all or only subgroups of the older population benefit from preventive home visits. Exploratory subgroup analyses of one trial suggested that subjects with good baseline functional status benefit from preventive home visits. 14 Second, we identified variations in the intervention approach between the nurses conducting the home visits in an earlier study. 4 Although such variations in the intervention process might influence outcomes in any type of preventive home visitation or comprehensive geriatric assessment program, none of the previous studies addressed this issue. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] To address these uncertainties, we conducted a randomized controlled trial to test the hypothesis that preventive home visits with annual multidimensional as-sessments have more favorable effects on functional status and nursing home admissions in low-risk compared with high-risk older persons. In addition, we used a study design that would permit an analysis of the impact on patient outcomes of differences in the intervention process among nurses.RESULTS The overall comparison between intervention and control groups showed comparable baseline characteristics, with the exception of a higher rate of people who depended on others to perform basic ADL in the intervention group compared with controls (12% vs 7%; P = .02) (Table 1 ). Of the 264 persons in the intervention group, 7 persons declined to be visited, and 8 persons died during the first year of the study. The remaining 249 persons received 8.5 ± 2.9 home visits (mean ± SD) during the 2 years of the intervention. A single visit lasted 74 ± 12 minutes (mean ± SD), with yearly assessments taking approximately 2 hours and quarterly visits approximately 1 hour. More than 90% of the participants' primary care physicians were contactedSUBJECTS AND METHODSSTUDY PARTICIPANTS The study was approved by the institutional review committee at the University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland. The study population was drawn from a health insurance list of community-residing subjects aged 75 years and older living in 3 ZIP code areas in Bern. This approach allowed us to obtain a representative study sample (more than 95% of older people in Switzerland had health insurance coverage in 1993) and to have access to health care use and expenditure data. First, we took a random sample of 1998 subjects from this list (57% of total enrollment) and excluded 806 of them for the following reasons: 165 people had died, 595 were living in nursing homes or board and care facilities, 17 had moved away, 17 did not speak German, and 12 reported that they had a terminal disease. Before asking the remaining subjects if they would participate in the study, we decided that only 1 member per household should be represented, since the unit of randomization was the individual subject and randomizing 1 eligible household member to the intervention group and another to the control group would not have been feasible. Therefore, we excluded subjects whose household partner had already agreed to participate in the study and replaced these subjects with persons who were randomly selected from the original health insurance list but matched for household membership status. Overall, among the eligible 1192 subjects, 401 (34%) declined and 791 (66%) agreed to participate in the study (Figure). There were no significant differences among participants and refusers by sex (women, 73% vs 73%, age (81.6 vs 81.8 years, respectively), self-perceived health (fair or poor, 33% vs 37%), and number of physician consultations in the 6 months prior to baseline assessment (6.6 vs 6.6 consultations).BASELINE DATA COLLECTION The baseline interview of the study participants was conducted at home. Trained interviewers using a structured interview form collected information on sociodemographic factors, basic activities of daily living (ADL) (bathing, dressing, feeding, transferring from bed to chair, and moving around inside the house), 19 instrumental ADL (cooking, handling finances, handling medication, shopping, using public or private transportation, and using the telephone), 19 selfperceived general health, 20 cognitive function, 21 depression, 22 gait and balance performance, 23 medication use, 24 and self-reported chronic conditions. Information about the subjects' baseline economic situation was obtained from tax files. Before randomization, subjects were classified according to their risk for future nursing home admissions, which we determined by developing a list of 6 criteria based on a literature search. [25] [26] [27] A total of 347 subjects fulfilled one or more of these criteria: (1) need for assistance in at least one of the basic ADL 19 ; (2) score higher than 5 on the Geriatric Depression Scale, Short Form 22 ; (3) Mini-Mental State Examination score lower than 24 21 ; (4) impaired gait and balance (score Ͻ19) 23 ; (5) more than 3 self-reported chronic conditions; and/or (6) use of 6 or more medications (as a proxy for comorbid conditions).RANDOMIZATION Based on the prerandomization baseline interview, all subjects who gave written informed consent were assigned to the appropriate risk stratum and listed within each of the 2 risk strata separately in ascending sequence of preassigned random numbers. As soon as 3 participants were available in any 1 risk stratum, an independent test center calculated the treatment assignment based on a random letter table and informed the project team. One subject from each triplet was allocated to the intervention and 2 were allocated to the control group. Since randomization was conducted separately within each risk stratum, the ratio of the number of subjects in the intervention group to the number of subjects in the control group was 1 to 2 within each risk stratum.INTERVENTION The subjects in the intervention group underwent annual multidimensional geriatric assessments in their homes. Three health nurses (certified registered nurses with an additional degree in public health nursing based on an 8-month postgraduate course) obtained medical histories, gave physical examinations, and measured hematocrit and glucose levels in blood samples. In addition, they performed a comprehensive geriatric assessment by evaluating subjects for hearing, vision, nutritional status, oral health, appropriateness of medication use, safety in the home, ease of access to the external environment, and social support. 28, 29 Based on this in-home visit and on the information collected at the prerandomization interview, the nurses prepared a problem list and discussed each case with one of the project team's geriatricians, developed rank-ordered recommendations, and conducted in-home follow-up visits at least once during the project by one of the project team's geriatricians.PRIMARY OUTCOMES At the 3-year follow-up, the analysis of the entire study sample revealed surviving subjects in the intervention group were less dependent on others to perform instrumental ADL compared with controls (P = .03) (Table 2 ). The intervention effects on the other main outcomes were not statistically significant. Table 2 reveals that the favorable ef-fect on instrumental ADL occurred among the subjects at low baseline risk (P = .04). In contrast, among subjects at high baseline risk, the intervention had no effect on basic and instrumental ADL and a significant unfavorable effect on nursing home admissions (P = .02). Sensitivity analyses based on alternate outcome definitions (eg, combining death with poor functional outcome, combining basic and instrumental ADL) did not change the conclusions. Interaction analyses revealed that the odds ratio (OR) for the intervention effect on nursing home admissions among subjects at low risk (OR, 0.5) (Table 2 ) was sig-every 3 months to monitor the implementation of the recommendations, make additional recommendations if new problems were detected, and facilitate compliance. In exceptional circumstances, the nurse telephoned the participant or was available by telephone. Nurses also provided health education, encouraged subjects to participate in selfcare, and attempted to improve their ability to discuss problems with their physicians. If participants gave their permission, their primary care physician received a letter from the project team with selected findings of the baseline geriatric assessment and selected recommendations to the physician; in urgent and complex situations, one of the project team's geriatricians called the primary care physician to discuss a problem or a recommendation. In addition, an interdisciplinary team (physical therapist, occupational therapist, dietitian, and social worker) was available to the nurse for discussing complex problems. Because health nurses have little training in physical assessment and gerontology in the Swiss system, the nurses received additional training in these areas and in conducting preventive home visits before and during the project. The rate of identified problems in older persons was measured with a method that we developed in an earlier study. 30 The nurses listed all identified problems of each older person and allocated these problems to a list of 24 predefined problem categories.OUTCOME DATA COLLECTION Primary outcome measures were the need for assistance in basic and instrumental ADL 19 at 3 years and the number of permanent admissions to nursing homes during the 3-year follow-up. Trained telephone interviewers independent of the intervention and blinded to the treatment assignment of study subjects collected information on ADL at 3 years. Information about nursing homes and survival was collected from proxies by telephone and was verified based on records from government and health insurance registries. This follow-up was conducted at 3 years, since the nurses gave additional recommendations at the final 2-year intervention visit; thus, older people were expected to implement these recommendations during the third year. We did not offer additional intervention follow-up visits during the third study year because of financial constraints. Secondary outcome measures were collected in the homes of all surviving study participants at the 2-year follow-up visit. For this purpose, nurses collected information on affect, 22 cognitive function, 23 gait and balance, 24 general health, 20 number of medications being taken, and influenza vaccination status. Health care cost and utilization data covering 6 months before and 2 years after randomization of all participants were obtained from insurance files. Data from the second half of the third year were not available because of a reform of the Swiss health care system. For the cost analysis, third-year ambulatory care cost data were imputed from data for the first half of the third year. It is a peculiarity of the Swiss health system that the financing of institutional care is shared between insurance companies and the public sector. Since hospital cost insurance records reflect only part of total hospital cost, public sector subsidies had to be imputed. In 1995, the daily cost for nursing home care was SFr 222 (US $133), and the daily cost for hospital care ranged from SFr 475 (US $285) to SFr 1579 (US $947), depending on the type of hospital. 31STATISTICAL ANALYSIS We calculated the sample size needed to detect a relative 30% risk reduction for disability in the intervention group compared with controls. In addition, for budgetary reasons, we decided to use a 1:2 ratio of the number of people in intervention vs control groups, since research study costs per subject in the intervention group were much higher than those for controls. Based on a power of 0.8 and a prevalence of instrumental ADL limitation of 50% among controls, required sample sizes were 138 for the intervention group and 276 for controls. In order to be able to analyze the high and low baseline subgroups separately, we doubled these sample sizes to 276 and 552, respectively. All analyses were by intention to treat, including subjects who refused intervention. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were employed to analyze dichotomous outcomes; multivariable regression analyses were used to analyze outcomes measured as scores (eg, cognitive performance); and multivariable Poisson regression analyses corrected for overdispersion 32 to analyze the number of hospital admissions and physician visits. Sensitivity analyses were conducted by repeating the analyses without adjusting for baseline characteristics of the participants and by using nonparametric procedures. For analyzing differences of intervention effects between risk strata or between ZIP codes, interaction analyses were conducted. The statistical models predicted outcomes (eg, basic ADL and instrumental ADL) with the following independent variables: a term indicating intervention group assignment, the interaction term (eg, intervention in subjects at high risk), a term indicating the risk stratum (or the ZIP code), age, sex, baseline functional status, and baseline self-perceived health status. nificantly (P = .03) different from the OR for the intervention effect on nursing home admissions among subjects at high risk (OR, 2.1) (Table 2 ).HEALTH STATUS, VACCINATION STATUS, AND MEDICATION USE Table 3 depicts the secondary outcomes for subjects at low baseline risk. At the 2-year follow-up, the mean gait and balance score was significantly higher in intervention subjects compared with controls. Clinically, this difference corresponds to the difference of whether or not a person had to use his or her hands for standing up from a chair and is related to an overall increase in strength, particularly lower-extremity strength. There were no significant differences in the affective or cognitive scores. The influenza vaccination rate was higher among subjects in the intervention group compared with controls (33% vs 25%, P = .01) (Table 3 ). At 2 years, the mean number of medications taken by subjects in the intervention group was higher (mean difference, 0.6) than among controls. There were no significant differences for hospital care use. The number of visits to primary care providers but not the number of visits to specialist physicians was higher for the intervention group compared with controls (P = .05). There was no difference in traditional home care use between the intervention and control groups. In contrast, the intervention had no effects on secondary outcomes (PՆ.10 for all) among subjects at high baseline risk. (Tabulated data are available from the authors on request.)NURSE PERFORMANCE After the first year of the intervention, despite similar training of the 3 nurses, nurse C identified significantly fewer problems compared with nurses A and B (PϽ.001) (Table 4 ). Differences in problem identification were found particularly for problems that required clinical judgment (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, medication management, social and environmental problems). Differences in the health status of people living in different ZIP code areas might account for minor differences among the nurses but not a variation of this kind. Over the 2-year period, the number of problems for which nurse C intervened (ie, gave recommendations) was significantly lower compared with the number of problems for which nurses A and B intervened (Table 4 ). *P values from bivariate analysis for differences between groups were not significant ( PϾ.05), with 1 exception (the proportion of subjects with dependence in basic ADL was higher in the intervention group compared with the control group [ P = .02]). All subjects were white. ADL indicates activities of daily living. †Values are mean ± SD. ‡Based on tax files.

We therefore analyzed outcomes for subjects in the ZIP code areas visited by nurses A and B (ZIP codes A and B) and compared them with the outcomes for subjects in the ZIP code area visited by nurse C (ZIP code C). Because the primary analyses showed differences in intervention effects according to the risk status of the study populations, we conducted these subgroup analyses separately for subjects at low and high baseline risk. Among subjects at low baseline risk in ZIP codes A and B, 2 persons (3% of 77 surviving subjects) from the intervention group compared with 22 (12% of 177 surviving subjects) from the control group were dependent on assistance for at least 1 of the ADL at the 3-year follow-up (Table 5 ). None of the 85 persons allocated to the intervention group, compared with 11 controls (6% of 191 subjects), was admitted to a nursing home during the study period. In contrast, there were no favorable effects for low-risk subjects in ZIP code C. Interaction analyses revealed that for subjects in ZIP codes A and B, the intervention effect on basic ADL was significantly (P = .047) more favorable compared with the intervention effect on basic ADL for subjects in ZIP code C. Among subjects at low risk in ZIP codes A and B, the intervention had a favorable effect on gait and balance (P = .005), but no effect in ZIP code C (P = .26). Among subjects at low risk in ZIP codes A and B, the intervention increased the influenza vaccination rate (39% vs 24%; P = .01), but among subjects at low risk in ZIP code C, the intervention did not affect the influenza vaccination rate (26% vs 29%, P = .37). Among subjects at high baseline risk in ZIP code C, the intervention had a statistically significant unfavorable effect (P = .002), with a higher number of nursing home admissions in the intervention group compared with controls (Table 5 ). Among high-risk subjects in ZIP codes A and B, there was no significant difference in nursing home admissions between the intervention and control groups (P = .54). Interaction analyses revealed that the intervention effect on nursing home admissions for highrisk subjects in ZIP code C was significantly different (P = .003 for interaction term) from the effect on nursing home admissions for high-risk subjects in ZIP codes A and B. Among high-risk subjects in ZIP codes A and B, there was a trend toward higher mortality in the intervention group compared with controls (Table 5 ), but the intervention effects on mortality did not differ between the ZIP codes A and B and ZIP code C (P = .69 for interaction term). The intervention did not have significant effects on secondary outcomes (PՆ.10 for all; data available from the authors on request).IMPACT OF PROGRAM ON HEALTH CARE COSTS Based on 3-year outcomes, the average yearly health care cost for people in the intervention group was approximately SFr 1500 (US $900) more than that for controls (a table with cost analyses for the entire sample is available from the authors on request). Table 6 presents the results in the subgroup of subjects with favorable results (ie, low baseline risk, ZIP codes A and B). Table 6 also shows the net cost difference per person and by year for subjects in the intervention group compared with con- §Number of persons with dependence among surviving project participants (for example, in the entire sample, 47 of the 264 people allocated to the intervention group died during the 3-year follow-up; 217 survived). Information on basic and instrumental ADL is based on telephone interviews with 608 study participants and 68 proxies (family members or professional caregivers) at the 3-year follow-up. Information was not obtained from one member of the control group (refusal). No. of persons permanently admitted to a nursing home over the 3-year follow-up period (data were available for all project participants). trols. In the first and second years of the program, the annual cost of the intervention itself was SFr 460 (US $276) per subject allocated to the intervention group. Since there was no cost for the intervention among control subjects (those who did not receive the intervention), the net difference for the intervention was SFr 460 (US $276) per subject per year. At the beginning of the third year of the study, the final annual in-home visit was conducted, and there were no follow-up home visits in the third year of follow-up. Therefore, the intervention costs were only SFr 184 (US $110) in the third year. In addition, the intervention resulted in additional net costs because it increased ambulatory care costs compared with those for controls. This increase of ambulatory care costs was a result of the fact that the intervention increased the number of visits to primary care physicians (Table 3 ). As depicted in Table 6 , the increase in ambulatory care costs was most pronounced in the first 2 years of the project. Among subjects at low risk in ZIP codes A and B, the mean yearly acute-care hospital cost for the intervention group was SFr 16 (US $10) less than that for the control group. Since analyses of 2-year outcomes revealed that the intervention had no statistically significant effect on acute-care hospital use (number of admissions, length of stay), this difference was rounded to 0. Finally, the intervention resulted in a reduction of nursing home admissions in subjects at low risk in ZIP codes A B. Among subjects at low risk in ZIP codes A and B, 11 persons from the control group were permanently admitted to a nursing home compared with none from the intervention group (Table 5 ). In the control group, the net costs for nursing home care were SFr 636 (US $382) per person in the second year of follow-up and SFr 2683 (US $1610) per person in the third year of follow-up. Overall, in the first 2 years of follow-up, total health care costs for subjects in the intervention group were higher than those for controls. However, in the third year of the project, the prevention of nursing home admissions in the intervention group resulted in substantial savings that more than offset the additional costs for home visits and ambulatory care, which resulted in net savings of SFr 2336 (US $1403) per person per year.OLDER PERSONS' SATISFACTION WITH INTERVENTION At 1 year after baseline assessment, in all ZIP codes, over 90% of subjects said they liked the home visits, and over .08 *All values are mean ± SD unless otherwise indicated. CI indicates confidence interval; ⌬, difference between the intervention and control groups; OR, odds ratio; and IRR, incidence rate ratio (the control group is the reference group). Effect estimates, CIs, and P values are adjusted for age, sex, baseline self-perceived health status, baseline functional status, and the baseline value of the dependent variables, except for effects on number of hospital days ( t test, based on participants with hospital admissions only) and on costs ( t tests, with unequal variances). †The denominator is 138 to 140 for the intervention group (8 persons died, 0-2 persons with missing data) and 278 to 280 for the control group (16 persons died, 0-2 persons with missing data). Scores were transformed to scales ranging from 0 to 100, with 100 representing the best possible health status. The affect score is based on the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale score 22 ; the cognitive function score on the 30-item Mini-Mental State Examination 21 ; the gait and balance score on a 28-point gait and balance examination 23 ; and the general health score on 3 items (overall condition, pain, and emotional health) of the COOP questionnaire. 20 ‡Based on 2-year follow-up health insurance data. For 14 persons who changed to other health insurance carriers during follow-up (7, intervention group; 7, control group), data are based on observation periods of less than 2 years. §Calculated by dividing the number of admissions by the period at risk (ie, time survived). Calculated by dividing costs by time survived. ¶Calculated by dividing the number of visits by the period at risk (ie, time survived minus time spent in institutions). 70% said the visits had been helpful. At 3 years, an independent interview was conducted with surviving subjects who had participated in the intervention. There were no significant differences in the proportion of subjects from the 3 ZIP code areas who said that, as a result of the intervention, they knew more about their medications (38% of interviewed subjects), felt more confident discussing their problems with their physician (36%), or had increased their level of physical activity (29%). However, the proportion of subjects who said that they were sorry the visits had stopped was significantly higher in ZIP code C (69%) compared with ZIP codes A and B (52%) (P = .04).COMMENT In this trial, we used an intervention strategy similar to that used in an earlier trial in Santa Monica, Calif. 4 Despite comparable study populations, the intervention effects differed between the 2 studies. The intervention effects of the Bern trial on functional status outcomes were weaker compared with those in the Santa Monica trial. It is likely that the low problem-detection rate in ZIP code C was a main factor contributing to the weaker intervention effects in the Bern trial. However, other factors must play a role, since the intervention effects were weaker in the Bern trial compared with the Santa Monica trial even if ZIP codes A and B were analyzed alone. The duration of the intervention in Bern was 2 years compared with 3 years in Santa Monica. The length of follow-up has been shown to be a key factor in determining the effects of geriatric assessment programs. 13 Furthermore, physician adherence to preventive recommendations in Bern was lower than in Santa Monica. For example, the influenza vaccination rate was lower in Bern compared with the rate in Santa Monica (31% vs 62%). The unfavorable intervention effects on nursing home admissions among subjects at high baseline risk were unexpected. This increase in nursing home admissions was caused by an increase of nursing home admissions in ZIP code C. Thus, the unfavorable effect of the intervention on nursing home admissions among highrisk subjects might be related to the intervention process of nurse C (eg, failure of the nurse to recognize early signs of catastrophic conditions). The trend toward a higher mortality rate in the intervention group among high-risk subjects in ZIP codes A and B compared with controls was probably a result of chance. A survival follow-up at 40 months in the high-risk subjects of ZIP codes A and B showed that the P value for the mortality difference between the intervention and control groups increased to .23. Overall, these results suggest that preventive home visits probably have no favorable effects on outcomes in high-risk older people, and, under certain circumstances, might even have unfavorable effects. We believe that for older persons at high risk, programs combining rehabilitation and care coordination should be used instead of preventive home visitation programs. For example, randomized studies have shown favorable effects of programs emphasizing tertiary prevention and rehabilitation in patients with recurrent congestive heart failure, 15, 16 in patients requiring home care services, 17 or in patients with dementia. 18 The finding of favorable intervention effects among low-risk subjects is consistent with our hypothesis that this type of intervention is more effective among well-  †Based on 1-way analyses of variance comparing the 3 groups or 2 tests. ‡For the methodological approach, see the ""Subjects and Methods"" section. §The number of problems identified during the initial 9 months of the intervention. The number of problems for which the nurse gave at least one recommendation or made one referral during the 2-year follow-up. ¶Includes referrals to physicians (eg, to discuss a symptom or a physical finding or to suggest a medication change) or to nonphysician health care professionals or community agencies (eg, community counseling or social support service) during the 2-year follow-up. #Based on health insurance record data for a 6-month period prior to randomization. functioning elderly people. In fact, secondary analyses of the Santa Monica study confirmed that favorable intervention effects were more pronounced in elderly people who were better functioning at baseline. 14 The present study lends insight into possible mechanisms that contribute to the benefit of the intervention. The intervention resulted in better gait and balance function but had no relevant impact on cognitive function, sug-gesting that this intervention does not reduce nursing home admissions related to dementia. The increase in primary care physician visits among intervention subjects compared with controls underscores the fact that the recognition of problems that physicians were unaware of and referrals to patients' primary care physicians contribute to the benefit. 34 While the intervention increased overall medication use among low-risk persons, data on medication categories suggested that this observed difference resulted from an increase in medications that were previously underused (eg, antihypertensive agents) and a decrease in previously overused medications (eg, benzodiazepines, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents). The results of this study demonstrate that the adequate detection of risk factors for functional status decline and the implementation of recommendations to address them are probably key factors contributing to the success of in-home prevention programs. The development of improved validated multidimensional assessment tools and guidelines for preventive recommendations could help to improve the intervention process. Based on a systematic literature review of risk factors for functional status decline, 35 we are currently validating a new multidimensional preventive assessment tool. 36 Computer technology might then be used to analyze the collected information and create checklists or individualized recommendations that could help the person performing the intervention to implement optimal individualized intervention plans. The results of the present study also suggest that home visits by volunteers (ie, performance of nurse C) may not be effective and that the intervention should be conducted by specially trained and selected professionals. To ensure the implementation of an adequate intervention process, comparative analyses of identified problems or the number and type of recommendations might help to identify potential deficits in the preventive interventions. In addition, use of ""tracer"" conditions (ie, the influenza vaccination rate, control of arterial hypertension, or level of patients' physical activity) and, in like fashion, ongoing monitoring of outcomes could be used for quality assurance. Although patient satisfaction with the preventive home care program is important for program success, measures of patient satisfaction are inadequate for judging the performance of the home visitors, and may, as shown in this study, even be misleading. The cost analysis revealed that in the subgroup with favorable outcomes (ie, among low-risk subjects in ZIP codes A and B), there was a temporal pattern (Table 6 ). The program resulted in additional costs in the early phase of the intervention, but in the third year, the additional health care costs (for preventive home visits and additional physician visits) were more than offset by savings in nursing home costs, indicating that this intervention requires an initial investment, with savings occurring only after time. The analysis of the impact of the intervention process on outcomes was based on the differences in performance among 3 nurses. Studies based on larger numbers of persons who perform interventions would be needed to analyze the impact of the intervention process on outcomes in more detail. Theoretically, factors other than the process of the intervention, such as differences in patient characteristics among those living in different ZIP code areas, might account for differences in outcomes between them. However, this is unlikely, since the results remained significant after controlling for baseline population factors. The classification into 2 risk strata was based on a combination of 6 individual risk factors, as used by others in the literature. Future studies with larger sample sizes would be needed to refine these criteria and identify those factors that best predict who might benefit from preventive home visits. With regard to the entire field of geriatric assessment, the findings regarding nurse C suggest that the intervention approach used by the professional conducting the assessment might be a key factor for determining effects and, together with risk status, might account for some of the previously unexplained discordant effects among earlier studies of comprehensive geriatric assessment. 14 Limitations of the study include the following: (1) Although we cannot exclude the possibility that the significant prerandomization difference in basic ADL between the intervention and control groups may have influenced, in part, the outcomes among highrisk subjects, it is unlikely that that this had an impact on the findings because the results for high-risk persons remained significant after controlling for baseline differences. (2) Since some of the secondary outcomes (health status and medication use) were collected by the nurses, we cannot exclude a measurement bias for these variables. (3) The hypothesis of weaker intervention effects in ZIP code C compared with ZIP codes A and B was formulated after and not prior to the ran-domization. However, although these analyses must be classified as secondary analyses, they were conducted according to an analytic plan with hypotheses formulated before outcome data collection. Thus, the present study suggests that preventive home visitation programs are effective in preventing functional decline in low-risk older people and may result in long-term cost savings by reducing the number of nursing home admissions in this population, and that favorable effects are likely related to the home visitor's performance in conducting the visits.21 * 21 Values are mean ± SD unless otherwise indicated.

Several inpatient geriatric health services have proven effectiveness in frail persons. However, the wish to live independently and policies that promote independent living as an answer to population aging call for community intervention models for frail elderly people. Maybe models such as preventive home visits, comprehensive geriatric assessment, and intermediate care qualify, but their efficacy is controversial, especially in frail elderly persons living in the community. With the Dutch EASYcare Study Geriatric Intervention Programme (DGIP) we developed a model to study effectiveness of problem based community intervention models in frail elderly people. Methods/Design: DGIP is a community intervention model for frail elderly persons where the GP refers elderly patients with a problem in cognition, mood, behaviour, mobility, and nutrition. A geriatric specialist nurse applies a guideline-based intervention with a limited number of follow up visits. The intervention starts with the application of the EASYcare instrument for geriatric screening. The EASYcare instrument assesses (instrumental) activities of daily life, cognition, mood, and includes a goal setting item. During the intervention the nurse regularly consults the referring GP and a geriatrician. Effects on functional performance (Groningen Activity Restriction Scale), health related quality of life (MOS-20), and carer burden (Zarit Burden Interview) are studied in an observer blinded randomised controlled trial. 151 participants were randomised over two treatment arms -DGIP and regular care -using pseudo cluster randomisation. We are currently performing the follow up visits. These visits are planned three and six months after inclusion.","Process measures and cost measures will be recorded. Intention to treat analyses will focus on post intervention differences between treatment groups. Discussion: The design of a trial evaluating the effects of a community intervention model for frail elderly people was presented. The problem-based participant selection procedure satisfied; few patients that the GP referred did not meet our eligibility criteria. The use of standard terminology makes detailed insight into the contents of our intervention possible using terminology others can understand well.Background In frail elderly persons chronic conditions and loss of function challenge their autonomy. This harms their wellbeing, and often leads to institutionalisation and high health care costs. There is much heterogeneity in the degree to which frailty affects older people. While some have many problems, others age successfully [1] . The introduction of the concept of successful aging voiced a change in our thinking about 'age-related' decline [2] . It marked the awareness that we cannot simply regard functional loss and dependency as consequences of the aging process itself when disease is absent. With this understanding these 'age-related' deficits became amenable to intervention. Of course, intervention should take the heterogeneity of the population into account; because of their complex clinical presentations and needs frail persons require another approach than people who age without many complications [3] . Although special services for frail older people have proven effectiveness in the form of inpatient geriatric health services [4] , several societal developments ask for community equivalents. People prefer to stay at home, even with considerable disability [5] . Another drive behind the development of community intervention models comes from policies that promote independent living as an answer to the questions raised by population aging [6] . Possibly, models such as preventive home visits, in home comprehensive geriatric assessment, and intermediate care provide effective health services for frail older people in the community. Unfortunately, both the definition and efficacy of these community intervention models remain subject of a vivid debate [7] [8] [9] [10] . The debate stems from the fact that the models gathered under these names show much heterogeneity as well as considerable overlap [11] . The lack of detailed insight into the content of these care models further complicates comparison [12, 13] . One of the major issues is the effectiveness of these models in the expanding group of frail older people. Despite the diversity, from literature we can distil certain elements that are used in many community intervention models. These are elements such as multidimensional and multidisciplinary working, person centred care, partici-pant selection, and treatment adherence. Empirical evidence is available for some of these elements. In this paper we will briefly summarise this knowledge on multidimensional assessment and management of elderly people in the community. This information grounds the choices we have made in designing a new community intervention model for frail elderly people living at home. Then, we will present the outlines of our intervention model and the design of the randomised trial in which we are currently evaluating the model. At this moment the recruitment period is already completed, and we are performing the follow up visits. Therefore, in addition to the details of the design, we will highlight some results of the conduct of the recruitment phase of our study.Evidence on intermediate care models Most research has been done on preventive home visits and comprehensive geriatric assessment, less scientific knowledge is available for intermediate care models. The studies that have been evaluating intermediate care focused mainly on the evaluation of intermediate care alternatives (e.g. rapid response teams, hospital at home, early discharge schemes) in direct comparison with hospital care [11, 14] . For most of the models that are not intended as direct alternatives to hospital care (e.g. residential rehabilitation, and community assessment and rehabilitation services) only descriptive data are available [15] .(Evidence-based) elements of community intervention models Virtually all community intervention models for older people share a similar multidimensional nature covering a variety of medical, psychological, functional, and social domains. As multidimensional working is a ubiquitous feature of these models, it is in itself not thoroughly studied. There are some discussions on which domains are to be included [8] . Both in preventive home visits and comprehensive geriatric assessment it is suggested that models with a multidisciplinary team are more effective than models with a unidisciplinary approach [8, 16] . Effectiveness is also claimed for longer follow up and more home visits, although a recent trial did not confirm this [16, 17] . Many models provide person centred care. Some even argue that 'patient-centred, problem-driven, goal-oriented management' is a 'key minimum specification' [16] . Another element that might strengthen the effectiveness of comprehensive geriatric assessment is to secure control over the implementation of the recommendations done in the programme [4] . Models implemented in regular care often do not have complete clinical control over the enforcement of the recommendations following from the programme. In this scenario, it is very important to involve the primary care provider who will be responsible for the implementation of the proposed plan [8] . This is also important because providers' co-operation is a determinant of patient adherence to program recommendations [18] . It is difficult to change physicians' behaviour and this urges the use of high intensity programmes. Furthermore, programme effectiveness might benefit from stronger emphasis on direct recommendations to participants, and should not rely too much on the uptake of recommendations by the primary care provider [8] . Participant selection is a feature of community intervention models for elderly people that received much attention in literature. This discussion focuses on two matters: participant selection on the basis of age and on the basis of participants' needs. Age as a selection criterion is not discussed much, but causes controversy. Some authors state that home visits are more effective in persons aged 75 and over, compared to younger individuals [19] . One meta-analysis did not find an age effect, and another meta-analysis concluded most benefits are to be expected in the youngest old [13, 20] . Frailty has received much more attention than age with respect to targeting these health services models to those who will benefit most. Most authors agree that too healthy elderly persons should be excluded, because both preventive home visits and comprehensive geriatric assessment are ineffective in these sprightly people [13, 21] . There is more dispute about the effectiveness of these models in frail older persons. While some exclude the frailest participants, because in these persons there are too few possibilities for reversibility, other authors stress the importance of including the frailest [8, 13, 21, 22] . Combining the evidence on the relevance of both age and frailty for participants selection Stuck concludes that health risk appraisal with individual reinforcement is beneficial to healthy persons aged 60 to 75, preventive home visits should focus on independent people aged 75 and over, and that other types of (institutional) services are needed for the frailest [23] . Unfortunately, considered this is true, this conclusion still disregards the population of frail elderly persons living in their own home.Considerations on designing the Dutch EASYcare study We wonder whether the effectiveness of community intervention models for frail elderly people can be enhanced using an alternative way of participant selection. In addition to selecting participants on the basis of age and frailty criteria, we ask the general practitioner (GP) to initiate the intervention when a problem requiring action emerges. This problem-based approach may enhance effectiveness because of better timing of the intervention. Others have shown this type of targeting can be effective, albeit in a non-randomised design [24] . General practitioner's and participant's compliance may also benefit, because both have discussed and agreed on the involvement of another health provider. The general practitioner is directly involved in the intervention model which realises more control over the clinical management. Direct involvement of the GP also provides feedback possibilities to better tailor the intervention and it safeguards continuity of care. We presume this continuity prevents the occurrence of negative effects that could result from discontinuation of the intervention. Hypothetically, the result is that the intensive involvement of health workers than other the general practitioner and regular home care is needed only temporarily. If an informal carer was involved, we actively engaged this person in our intervention. We believe this involvement is a precondition for an effective community intervention model focussing on frail elderly people. However, to our knowledge, this caregiver involvement has not received much attention in the empirical studies of community intervention models.Objectives The objective of our study is to determine the effects of the Dutch EASYcare Study Geriatric Intervention Programme (DGIP) compared to regular medical care in improving health related quality of life in independently living elderly persons and in improving caregiver burden. Moreover, we want to determine the costs of the Dutch EASYcare Study Geriatric Intervention Programme.Methods/DesignStudy design and setting The study is an observer blinded randomised controlled trial. Pseudo cluster randomisation was used to randomly allocate the participants to the DGIP or to a regular care group. Pseudo cluster randomisation is a randomisation method that aims to prevent both the occurrence of selection bias and contamination in a single design. We will discuss it in more detail below. The Ethical committee of the Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre approved of the study.Study population 54 general practitioners from 36 GP practices in and around Nijmegen, the Netherlands, were willing to recruit subjects. We started with 38 GPs, but increased this number during the recruitment period because of disappointing inclusion rates. During the inclusion period of 21 months 155 eligible participants were randomised. We decided not to include in follow up and analysis those participants who experienced severe intercurrent disease necessitating hospital admittance, were admitted to a nursing home, died, or withdrew informed consent within one week after randomisation. The possibility of the study to have effect within one week after randomisation was judged as negligible, because it took about a week before nurses started the intervention, and the follow up visits were judged to be too strenuous for these seriously ill patients. Therefore 151 participants were included in follow up and analysis; 85 were included in the group that received the intervention model, and 66 were included in the regular care group.Eligibility criteria Subjects had to be eligible for participation in our intervention model (table 1 ). All participants had to be living in their own home or in a home for the aged and had to be 70 years or older. When we started recruiting participants we applied an age criterion of 75 years or older. Unfortunately, seven months after the start of the recruitment the inclusion rates fell short of expectations. We decided we were able to broaden the age criterion, because the combination of frailty criteria and a problem driven approach safeguarded selection of eligible participants. We restricted participant inclusion to those who scored below maximum (indicating good performance) on at least one of the following instruments: Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), MOS-20 subscale mental health, or Groningen Activity Restriction Scale (GARS) [25] [26] [27] . For the MMSE the cut off was equal to or less than 26 out of 30, for MOS-20 mental health equal to or less than 75 out of 100, and for GARS the cut off was equal to or greater than 25. The GARS score ranges 18 to 54, where 18 indicates best functional performance. We excluded participants with an MMSE of less than 20 or a proved moderate to severe dementia (Clinical Dementia Rating scale [CDR] > 1, 0) and no informal caregiver, because we expected serious problems in the acquisition of research data in these persons. Persons already receiving forms of intermediate care or health care from a social worker or community-based geriatrician were also excluded, because this made it difficult to establish which effect was measured. Receiving home care, however, was not an exclusion criterion. Persons already on the waiting list for a nursing home, or who had a life expectancy of less than six months, because of terminal illness, were excluded as well.Inclusion criteria 70 years of age and over The patient lives independently or in a home for the aged The patient has a health problem that was recently presented to the GP by the patient or informal caregiver The request for help is related to the following problem fields: cognitive disorders, behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia, mood disorders, mobility disorders and falling, or malnutrition The patient/informal caregiver and GP have determined a goal they want to achieve Fulfil one or more of these criteria: MMSE (Mini Mental State Examination) equal to or less than 26, GARS (Groningen Activity Restriction Scale) equal to or greater than 25 or MOS-20/subscale mental health equal to or less than 75Exclusion criteria The problem or request for help has an acute nature, urging for action (medical or otherwise) within less than one week The problem or request for help is merely a medical diagnostic issue, urging for action only physicians (GP or specialist) can offer MMSE < 20 or proven moderate to severe dementia (Clinical Dementia Rating scale [CDR] > 1, 0) and no informal caregiver (no informal caregiver is defined as: no informal caregiver who meets the patient for at least once a week on average) The patient receives other forms of intermediate care or health care from a social worker or community-based geriatrician The patient is already on the waiting list for a nursing home because of the problem the patient is presented with in our study Life expectancy < 6 months because of terminal illness As a result of a mistake, in one case the age criterion was violated. However, the intervention team agreed that this younger case (age of this participant was 69 years) fitted well into the model. As exclusion was judged to be in disagreement with the ethical treatment of participant data, this participant was kept in follow up and analysis.Treatment arms and randomisation Participants were randomly allocated over two treatments arms: DGIP and regular care. No restrictions were imposed on the care participants were allowed to receive in the regular care group. Given the nature of our intervention we considered the use of two different allocation procedures available in literature: cluster randomisation or individual randomisation [28] . The use of a cluster randomised design may have had an advantage over the use of an individual randomised design, because of the possible occurrence of contamination in our trial when individual randomisation was applied [29] . On the other hand a cluster randomised design had several disadvantages. The GP would have known the allocation outcome for his cluster after the first patient in a fully cluster randomised design. This might have caused selection bias resulting in incomparability of treatment arms [30, 31] . At the same time we presumed it likely that the recruitment of subjects in the control clusters would progress slowly. Why should a GP bother to refer a patient to a study, when the GP knows already that the patient will enter the control group? There is also evidence for differential recruitment rates in cluster randomisation [32] . We therefore choose to use an innovative two-step pseudo cluster randomisation procedure [28, 33] . First the GPs were randomised into two groups; group I and group C. The results of this randomisation were not revealed. Then within each of these groups randomisation at the patient level was carried out. This randomisation was stratified by GP and performed in such a way that in group I the majority (approximately 80%) of the participants received the intervention treatment, while the others received standard treatment. In group C the dysbalance was reversed: the majority received standard treatment and the others got the intervention treatment. This approach had important advantages. The GP did not know in advance which treatment a patient was going to get, so this reduced the chance of selection bias. It also prevented the occurrence of negative recruitment effects that might have resulted from being randomised to a control cluster. Had the GPs known in advance the group they were assigned to (I or C), the predictability of an individual randomisation decision had been larger than in an individually randomised trial. However, the randomisa-tion of GPs occurred blinded. In such a situation, the GP can only gain knowledge on the randomisation proportion through the recruitment of participants. As the number of enrolled patients per practice was expected to be no more than 10, the chances to correctly guess the odds for each individual treatment are limited. We expect the contamination due to the intervention treatment to be negligible in group C, because there are only a limited number of participants in this group on the experimental treatment. As the majority of the patients is on intervention treatment, the contamination may be a problem in patients in group I who are on standard treatment, but then it probably affects only a small portion of the patients. A randomisation procedure with adaptive weights (minimisation) was used to ensure a balanced distribution of high versus low percentage of elderly per GP-practice and of the availability of a nurse practitioner in GP practice in the two groups I and C [34] . The patients were randomised with adaptive weights to get evenly distributed numbers of sex, and presented health problem. A person not related to the study conduct performed the randomisation.Intervention model: DGIP GPs referred independently living older patients to our model when there was a problem in cognition, nutrition, behaviour, mood, or mobility. The problem had to urge for nursing assessment, co-ordination of care, or therapeutic monitoring and case management. Requests were rejected if they had an acute nature or if they were purely medical diagnostic requests. A suitable case is for example a widow living on her own in a flat on the second floor with no elevator. The GP has doubts about her cognitive abilities and she has depressive symptoms as well. This seems to affect her daily functioning, although to what extent is unclear. She has only a daughter to look after her. After negotiating a preliminary goal with the patient, the referring GP contacted the geriatrician involved in the study. Within two weeks a geriatric specialist nurse visited the patient at home. The instrument EASYcare was applied during this first visit [35] . EASYcare is an instrument for geriatric assessment that consists of items about (instrumental) activities of daily life, cognition, mood, and ends with a goal setting item. The goal initially negotiated by patient and GP was further elaborated in an operational objective. If an informal carer was present, the nurse provided this person a carer burden assessment and the results were implemented in the care plan.

The nurse, geriatrician, and general practitioner frequently discussed the necessary nursing interventions, the effect of the interventions, the level of care that was needed, and the possibilities for reversibility. If necessary the nurse consulted and advised other involved health care workers, such as home care or physical therapist. We had two nurses and two geriatricians available for the execution of our intervention. We developed guidelines based on best nursing practice for each health problem to structure activities, because literature has pointed at the possibility that the effects of home visiting programmes are related to the home visitor's performance in conducting the visits [36] . Therefore, we structured the intervention in order to diminish this effect, without harming the flexibility of the model. We piloted our intervention model in a feasibility study [40] . With some minor changes, this model was judged to be applicable in the current study.Data collection and outcome measures Within one week after referral a researcher (RM, ME) interviewed patients at home to obtain written informed consent and to collect baseline demographic characteristics and data on general health conditions. If the participant was not able to give informed consent we asked a proxy to do so. The participants always gave verbal assent and did not reject the measurements. Before the interview the participant received a written confirmation of the appointment and a questionnaire. We asked the partici-pant to fill out the questionnaire before the appointment. If the participant was unable to fill out the questionnaire independently, we allowed help from another person. In some cases the interviewer filled out the questionnaire during the interview. We recorded the amount of help the participant received in filling out the questionnaire. The participants provided data on the following measures: age, gender, type of residence, and the use of home care. Also, data were collected on functional abilities, cognitive condition, mobility, health-related quality of life, and loneliness. If an informal carer was available we collected data on informal carer characteristics using a questionnaire. We collected data on type and amount of care provided, time spent on caring, and carer burden. These measurements are repeated three and six months after inclusion. The same researcher that performed the baseline visit carries out these interviews. This researcher is not involved in the intervention nor does the researcher know the allocation decision. After each follow up visit the researcher indicates whether blinding remained intact or not. Primary outcome measures relating to participant characteristics are functional performance in (independent) activities of daily living measured using Groningen Activity Restriction Scale and mental health using subscale mental health MOS-20. Primary outcome measure in informal carers is carer burden using the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) [41] . An overview of secondary outcomes and a complete list of all measurements are provided in table 2 .Process evaluation We collect data on the following set of process variables: the content of the intervention programme, the adherence of participants and informal carers in the intervention group to advices given during an intervention, experiencesNativity Own questionnaire Co-morbidity Cumulative Illness Rating Scale-Geriatrics (CIRS-G) [51] from medical history in GP Information System Use of home care of participants and informal carers with the intervention model, and data on GP care and care of other involved professionals in both treatment arms. We collect data on the content of the intervention process, because this may help to identify which programme characteristics are most beneficial. An abstract form is used to extract this information from the nursing records after completion of all individual interventions. We extract information on treatment goals, nursing diagnoses (NANDA) [37] , nursing interventions (NIC) [38] , nursing outcomes (NOC) [39] , and the employed diagnostic instruments. Compliance of participants and informal carers is an important determinant of carrying out a successful intervention. When an individual intervention is finished the nurse that executed the intervention indicates in an MS Access ® form which of a number of pre-specified advices were given. Another nurse calls the participant or informal carer one month later to check compliance on these advices. We score subjective treatment effects in treatment group using a questionnaire that participants and informal carers filled out after the first follow up visit. Data on GP care will be collected in both treatment arms from the information that is routinely available from the General Practice's Information System (Huisartsen Informatie Systeem). We collect the following data: medical history using ICPC-2 (International Classification of Primary Care) [42] , number and content of contacts during six months of follow up using ICPC-2, number and nature of referrals, and medication using ATC classification (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical drug classification) [43] . Data on the use of home care are collected in the participant questionnaire. The data on GP care will be collected at the end of the follow up period. These data are collected in order to be able to clarify the observed intervention effect and to establish costs.Costs To be able to calculate costs, data will be collected on the following cost variables. Nurses will register the time spent on the intervention using the MS Outlook ® agenda. They will register the number of visits per participant. They also register the time spent on consultation, phone calls, travelling, and administration. Data on the workload of the GP and the geriatrician will be extrapolated from the workload of the nurses. The data we collect on the care provided were already described in the paragraph 'process evaluation'. Finally, we will derive salary costs, administrative costs, and costs for materials.Sample size considerations A change in the primary outcome measure of functional performance (GARS-3) of 4.5 points on a scale ranging from 18 (complete independence) to 54 (complete dependence) can be found with a power (1-β) of 0.80 and α (two sided) of 0.05 in comparing two groups of 77 subjects, when pseudo cluster randomisation is applied. We use a standard deviation of 8.5, which we calculated from a pilot study. This standard deviation is well in the range of the measures of spread other studies have found [27] . A mean increase of 4.5 points is chosen as clinically relevant, because a 4.5 point increase of the overall score indicates an improvement of 25% of all items by one functional class (each item's score is classified as follows: completely dependent 3 point, partly dependent 2 points and completely independent 1 point). Cluster size is estimated to be approximately 10 participants per GP. The exact calculations and considerations are extensively described in Teerenstra et al [33] .Statistical analysis Descriptives will be used to assess comparability of both intervention and control group for background and confounding variables. Our primary analysis will focus on the treatment arms' differences in the primary outcome measures' changes from baseline (GARS, MOS-20 subscale mental health, and Zarit Burden Interview) at three months of follow up (T 1 ). This will be done in intentiontreat-analysis. We will use mixed linear model analysis (Proc Mixed in SAS ® 8) to quantify these differences. We will account for clustering at the level of the GP through the addition of a random intercept for GP to the three models. The baseline measurements of GARS, MOS-20 subscale mental health, and Zarit Burden Interview will be added to the respective models as a covariate. The factors we stratified for in the randomisation (GP-characteristics, sex of participant, and participant's presented health problem) will also be added to the models as covariates. No further corrections will be made. A conditional analysis of the treatment arms' differences in changes from baseline at six months (T 2 ) will be performed if there is a significant effect at T 1 . Apart from replacing the scores at three months with those at six months the same three models will be used. The secondary analyses will be performed on the treatment arms' differences in time trend of the primary outcome measures GARS, MOS-20 subscale mental health, and Zarit Burden Interview during follow up. Secondary analysis will further focus on the differences between treatment arms of the secondary outcome measures at three and six months of follow up. Kaplan-Meier estimates and hazard ratios will be used to quantify the intervention's effect on living conditions and mortality. Subgroup analyses will be performed for the following subgroups: living in one's own home versus living in a home for the aged, and higher versus lower levels of cognitive function. All analyses will be performed in SAS ® 8.Discussion In this paper we presented the design of a randomised controlled trial that evaluates the effects of a community intervention model for frail elderly people living on their own. The design of this study has shown to be very challenging. Although the recruitment of the participants took much effort, we have included a number of subjects that should be large enough to provide reliable answers to our research questions. Our participants were selected using a problem-based approach in which the GPs decided in co-operation with the geriatrician which patients were suitable for this intervention model. This participant selection procedure satisfied; only a minor number of the referred patients did not meet our eligibility criteria based on frailty and age. Probably, piloting our intervention model was important to achieve this. As discussed earlier, there is a lack of insight into the content of most community intervention models studied. We decided to use standard terminology such as ICPC, NANDA, NIC, NOC and ATC codes to provide insight into our intervention when used in practice. This makes detailed insight possible using terminology others can understand well. The selection of the best randomisation method was a final major issue we had to deal with and that took much of our time. We think this randomisation procedure satisfies. Nevertheless, we will closely monitor and report in future papers how the randomisation procedure performs in practice.Dissemination of the results of this study is planned for 2006. flow chart Dutch EASYcare Study Figure 1 flow chart Dutch EASYcare Study.

Spherical equivalent refractive error (SER), axial length (AL), pupil diameter (PD), and amplitude of accommodation (AMP) were measured every 4 months. After 2 years, the SER changes were -0.80 (0.52) D, -0.93 (0.59) D and -1.33 (0.72) D and the AL changes were 0.62 (0.29) mm, 0.72 (0.31) mm and 0.88 (0.35) mm in the 0.02% and 0.01% atropine groups and control group, respectively. There were significant differences between changes in SER and AL in the three groups (all P < 0.001). The changes in SER and AL in the 2nd year were similar to the changes in the 1st year in the three groups (all P > 0.05). From baseline to 2 years, the overall decrease in AMP and increase in PD were not significantly different in the two atropine groups, whereas the AMP and PD in the control group remained stable (all P > 0.05). 0.02% atropine had a better effect on myopia control than 0.01% atropine, and its effects on PD and AMP were similar to 0.01% atropine. 0.02% or 0.01% atropine controlled myopia progression and AL elongation synchronously and had similar effects on myopia control each year.","The prevalence of myopia is significantly increasing worldwide, especially in Asia [1] [2] [3] . It is predicted that by 2050, about half of the population will be suffering from myopia; as many as 10% of the cases are expected to be of high myopia 4 . High myopia and excessive eye growth can cause sight-threatening ocular complications, resulting in a huge socio-economic burden 5, 6 . Several studies, including those carried out in Singapore, mainland China, Hong Kong China and other countries, have shown that moderate-and low-concentration atropine eye drops (e.g., 0.01%, 0.025%, 0.05%) may effectively and safely slow the progression of myopia in children [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] .However, most of these studies, including our previous study 18 , were 1-year short term follow-up studies, except the 5-year follow-up study in Singapore ( Atropine for the Treatment of Myopia, ATOM), 2-year follow-up studies in Hong Kong China (Low-Concentration Atropine for Myopia Progression, LAMP) and in the United States 8, 11, 12 . Notably, in the ATOM2 study 7 , 0.01% atropine had comparable efficacy in controlling myopia progression with 0.1% and 0.5% atropine. Moreover, 0.01% atropine was more effective in the second year than in the first year. The changes in axial length (AL) and spherical equivalent refractive error (SER) were not synchronous; the degree of myopia was stable, while AL continued to increase between 8 and 24 months after using 0.01% atropine. However, these phenomena were not observed with higher concentrations of atropine (0.1% or 0.5%). During the second-year observation in the LAMP study 11 , which lacked a control group, low-concentration atropine had a dose-related effect on myopia control. The efficacy of 0.05% atropine was double than that of 0.01% atropine. Compared with the 1st year, the 2nd year efficacies of 0.05% and 0.025% atropine were similar, with a mild improvement in the 0.01% atropine group. Also, 0.01%, 0.025%, and 0.05% atropine controlled both myopia progression and AL elongation. In a 2-year retrospective study in the US 12 , 0.01% atropine had a better effect on myopia control during the second year than during the first year. However, only refractive error, but not AL, was measured in that study. Our 1-year study found that 0.02% atropine had a better effect on myopia control than 0.01% atropine, but 0.02% and 0.01% atropine showed similar side-effects 18 . This 2-year study was a continuation of our previous OPEN 1 The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, No. 1 Jianshe Road, Zhengzhou 450000, China. 2 These authors contributed equally: Can Cui and Xiujuan Li. * email: fuaicun2019@qq.com Changes in SER and AL over 2 years for 0.02%, 0.01%atropine, and control groups. An atropine concentration-dependent response was observed for myopia control after 24 months of treatment. The SER changes were -0.80 (0.52) D, -0.93 (0.59) D, and -1.33 (0.72) D and the AL changes were 0.62 (0.29) mm, 0.72 (0.31) mm, and 0.88 (0.35) mm in the 0.02% and 0.01% atropine and control groups, respectively. There were significant differences between the changes in SER and AL in the three groups (all P < 0.05) (Fig. 2A, B and Table 2 ). In total, 49.5%, 45.2%, and 26.9% of the subjects progressed by less than 1.0 D in the 0.02% and 0.01% atropine and control groups, respectively, whereas 16.2%, 18.8%, and 34.8% subjects progressed by more than 2.0 D in the 0.02% and 0.01% atropine and control groups, respectively. mm during the first year of treatment and 0.32 (0.21) mm, 0.35 (0.22) mm, and 0.42 (0.34) mm during the second in the three groups, respectively. The changes in SER during the 1st year were similar to those during the 2nd year in the three groups (all P > 0.05), and AL showed a similar trend to that of SER in every year. The correlation between the changes in AL (independent variable) and SER (dependent variable) after the 2-year treatment was -1.40 (P < 0.0001). Multivariate regression analyses after adjusting for baseline SER showed a strong relationship between the changes in AL and SER (β = -1.42, 95%CI, -1.61 to -1.21, P < 0.0001) (Fig. 2A, B , and Table 2 ).

There were no dose-dependent effects of atropine on AMP or PD in the atropine-treated groups. From baseline to 4 months, AMP decreased and PD increased significantly in the two atropine groups (all P < 0.001). From 4 to 24 months, AMP and PD remained stable. From baseline to 24 months, the overall changes in AMP (P = 0.67) and PD (P = 0.51) were not significantly different in the two atropine groups, whereas the AMP (P = 0.28) and PD (P = 0.19) in the control group remained stable (Fig. 3A ,B and Table 3 ).    Adverse events. During 1st year, 32 (23%, 0.02% atropine) and 33 (24%, 0.01% atropine) children were photophobic in bright sunlight, but no other discomfort in normal indoor or daily outdoor light was experienced in either of the atropine groups. In one of the cases, photophobia disappeared during the 2nd year (after 18-month treatment with 0.01% atropine). Photophobia was resolved by wearing sunglasses or sun hats during outdoor activities. No child was allergic to 0.01% or 0.02% atropine or showed any other discomfort associated with atropine during the 2nd year. Three children in the control group were photophobic in bright sunlight for about 2 months in the first year, but had no other discomfort in normal indoor or daily outdoor light.Discussion Our 2-year study showed that once-nightly use of 0.02% atropine had a better effect on myopia control than 0.01% atropine, and its effects on PD and AMP were similar to those of 0.01% atropine for children in mainland China. Treatment with 0.02% or 0.01% atropine controlled myopia progression and AL elongation synchronously and had similar effects on myopia control each year. Comparisons between the current study and other studies are shown in Table 4 . This study showed that 0.02% atropine had a better effect on myopia control than 0.01% atropine over 2 years, which was consistent with the studies in Singapore, Hong Kong China, and Korea 7, 10, 17 . They all demonstrated that there was a dose-related myopia control response to atropine. The higher the concentration of atropine, the better the myopia progression control. To date, three studies 7, 11, 12 reported the efficiency of low-concentration atropine in controlling myopia progression for more than 2 years. The ATOM2 study 7 in Singapore found that 0.01% atropine was more effective during the second year, as the change in SER was only -0.06 D during the second year compared with -0.43D during the first year. During phase 2 of the LAMP study in Hong Kong China 11 , which did not involve a control group during the second year, the efficacy of 0.01% was slightly better during the second than the first year. A multicenter case-control retrospective study in a multiethnic cohort of children using 0.01% atropine in the USA 12 showed a change in SER of -0.3 D during the first year and -0.2 D during the second year, which also showed that the efficacy of 0.01% atropine during the second year was better. They postulated that the better efficacy of 0.01% atropine during the second year was due to cumulative effects over time and suggested that the initial treatment should be continued for at least 2 years 7, 11 . However, the efficacies of 0.02% and 0.01% atropine during the second year were similar to those recorded during the first year in the current study. A difference in the increase in the degree of myopia each year after the use of low-dose atropine has not been established yet, and it necessitates further exploration. According to our 2-year results, if the efficiency of 0.01% atropine during the first year is not reasonable, increasing the atropine concentration or combining 0.01% atropine with OK lenses [19] [20] [21] [22] may improve the efficiency of myopia control. Few studies have reported the efficacy of low-dose atropine in slowing axial elongation. To date, five studies 7, 11, 13, 17, 18 have reported AL changes after using low-dose atropine (Table 4 ). In the current 2-year study, the control rates of SER progression by 0.01% and 0.02% atropine were 32.9% and 45.7% during the first year and 27.0% and 33.3% during the second year, respectively. The respective control rates of AL elongation were 19.6% and 34.8% during the first year and 16.7% and 23.8% during the second year. There was a strong association between the changes in AL and SER (β = -1.42), suggesting that low-dose atropine controlled myopia progression and AL elongation synchronously. When assessing the efficacy of low-dose atropine in controlling myopia progression in children, both SER and AL must be measured. However, there was a large range of ages and initial SER in the 0.02% and 0.01% atropine and control groups. It has been suggested that lens thinning may have a greater role in emmetropisation (and therefore changes in refractive error) in younger age groups than older [23] [24] [25] .The potential influence of the lens and its role may confound the expected relationship between AL and SER in different age groups, which requires further study. Similar results to the current study on the relationship between the changes in AL and SER were reported in Hong Kong China, Korea, and mainland China studies 11, 13, 17 . However, the ATOM2 study 7 found that 0.01% atropine only controlled myopia progression but not AL elongation; while the degree of myopia was stable, AL continued to increase between 8 and 24 months after using 0.01% atropine, but this study did not have a proper placebo group to compare AL elongation. The control of SER progression using atropine varies by race and ethnicity. Studies showed that 0.01% atropine over 12 months controlled SER progression by 50.5-83.3% in White children and 21-59.2% in East Asian Children (Table 4 ). However, moderate-dose and high-dose atropine may significantly slow myopia progression in Asian children compared with White children 26 . The reasons for the different effects of atropine use by race and ethnicity remain unknown. The remaining question that needs to be clarified in future studies is as follows: ""what is the specific mechanism for the race/ethnicity difference in the effects of different concentration atropine?"" Further randomized clinical trials should be conducted to confirm the present findings. In the four studies 11, 13, 17, 18 on East Asian children using 0.01% atropine, the control rates of AL elongation were similar (14.6%, 18.2%, 20%, and 22%), except for the Singapore study 7 (no effect). Meanwhile, the control rate of AL elongation was less than that of SER progression, whereas AL was not measured in the four studies 12, [14] [15] [16] on White children after using 0.01% atropine. Consistent with other studies [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] , there was a higher proportion of major ocular symptoms such as photophobia and near-vision blur during the early stage after using low-dose atropine, then the proportion of ocular symptoms decreased and remained stable. Approximately 17% of the children in both atropine groups had photophobia in bright sunlight but no other discomfort symptoms during the second year. Different proportions of photophobia (0-24%) and near-vision blur (0-5.9%) have been reported by different studies [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . Photophobia may show individual differences, regardless of age, gender, myopic degree, and other parameters 27 . Overall, the major ocular symptoms after using low-dose atropine are mild and tolerable and do not affect the studies and daily activities of children. The strength of this study is that it used a control group throughout. Although advice from our human ethics committee mandated that subjects were to be offered either atropine or no atropine and double-blinded randomization to be carried out only for the two active arms of the study, the control and test groups had similar demographic and clinical parameters, and the subjects were recruited using identical inclusion criteria, contemporaneously, and from the same population. In conclusion, our 2-year findings showed that 0.02% atropine had a better effect on myopia control than 0.01% atropine, and 0.01%and 0.02% atropine showed similar effects on PD, AMP, and discomfort symptoms after 24 months of treatment in children in mainland China. The two low concentrations had a similar efficiency for myopia control each year. Individualized corrective methods (such as increasing the atropine concentration from 0.01 to 0.02%, combining lose-dose atropine with OK lenses) should be adopted to improve the myopia control effects in children with unreasonable efficiency after using low-dose atropine for 1 year. Low-dose atropine controlled myopia progression and AL elongation synchronously.Methods Details of the methods and study design have been published elsewhere and are briefly described here 18 . The inclusion criteria were Chinese children aged 6-14 years with myopic SER of -1.25 to -6.00 D in both eyes, astigmatism of less than 2.0 D, anisometropia of less than 1.0 D, monocular best-corrected visual acuity of 16/20 or better, and intraocular pressure (IOP) between 10 and 21 mmHg, with no other eye diseases or surgery. Those who had previously used atropine, pirenzepine, or rigid gas-permeable or OK lenses or multifocal contact lens to control myopia progression or were unable to comply with the study schedule were excluded. This study was registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (registration number: ChiCTR-IPD-16008844, first registration in 14/07/2016) and approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University (Approval Number: 2016-35). Under the premise of following the Declaration of Helsinki, all the candidates and guardians provided and signed an informed consent form. At the randomization visit, eligible subjects were given the option of atropine or no atropine, per human ethics committee of requirements, and the atropine groups were subsequently assigned in a double-blinded and randomized manner either to 0.01% or 0.02%. All subjects were prescribed best-corrected spectacles for constant wear during the day. The children in the atropine treatment group received 0.01% or 0.02% atropine eye drops in both eyes once every night. The 0.01% and 0.02% atropine eye drops (pH = 5.4-5.6, 3 mL sealed bottle, 15-25 °C room temperature storage, discarded eye drops after opening the bottle for 1 month) were prepared by diluting 1% atropine eye drops (Eye and ENT Hospital Affiliated to Fudan University) with 0.9% normal saline under sterile conditions and subsequently, adding a preservative (0.3 mg/mL ethylparaben). The atropine eye drops were degraded less (about 1.8%) after opening the eye drops bottle for 1 month and its properties were relatively stable. The shelf life was over 6 months. Neither the examiner nor the subject knew the concentration of the eye drops. All eye drops were kept and distributed by the same doctor. Standardized ophthalmological examination for all subjects was performed at baseline, at the 1-month monitoring visit, and then every 4 months until 2 years after treatment. Examinations in the second year were the same as those in the first year as described previously. All examinations were performed by the same physician in the morning. Axial length (AL), corneal power, and anterior chamber depth (ACD) were evaluated using a non-contact partial coherence interferometer (IOLMaster; Carl Zeiss Meditec AG, Germany). On each occasion, five successive measurements were taken and their mean was used for analysis. The pupil diameter was measured with an autorefractor (NIDEK, AR-1, Japan) under bright light indoors. The light in the examination room was constant with the illumination of 300 to 310 lx (TES-1332A illumination photometer). The children had to adapt to the ambient light in the examination room for 10 min before the measurement. Three consecutive measurements were taken, and the average value was recorded. Accommodation amplitude (AMP) was measured monocularly by the push-up technique. The children wore their fully corrected spectacle prescription and focused on the previous line of best-corrected visual acuity with the right eye while the left one was occluded. The children were instructed to focus on a letter as the chart was moved closer. They were told to keep the letter as clear as possible until it could no longer be held in clear focus. The inverse of the final distance in meter was recorded as the child's AMP. AMP was recorded three times and the average taken. Discomfort symptoms in the experimental groups were assessed using a paper questionnaire 18, 24 during each follow-up visit. Cycloplegic autorefraction was performed using four drops of compound tropicamide eye drops 28, 29 (0.5% tropicamide and 0.5% neo-synephrine) (Santen, Japan) administered to both eyes at an interval of 10 min. Ten minutes after the last drop, cycloplegic autorefraction was measured three times by an autorefractor (Topcon RM 8000A, CA). Three readings, all within a difference of 0.25 D, were averaged for analysis. SER was calculated as the sphere plus half of the cylindrical power. Continuous baseline variables were expressed as mean (SD) and evaluated by analysis of variance. Categorical variables, such as sex and parental myopia status, were expressed as percentages (%) and evaluated using the Chi-squared test. A generalized additive mixed model was used to estimate the longitudinal trend with time (baseline, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 months) for dependent variables (SER, AL, PD, and AMP) and the differences in the rate of change between the three groups. The change represents the slope for each treatment group of dependent variables over time, and the change difference represents the difference in the slopes of the dependent variables over time of the groups. A P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using Empower (WWW. EMPOWERSTATA COM; X & Y Solutions, Boston, MA) and R.Figure 1 . 1 Figure 1.

Due to complex political and administrative reasons, 3 areas had benefited from drainage improvements, 3 from both drainage and sewerage improvements, and 3 from neither. An extensive questionnaire was applied to collect information on each child and on the conditions of the household, and mothers recorded diarrhoea episodes in their children aged < 5 years daily for 1 year, using calendars. Formightly home visits were made to collect the data. The incidence of diarrhoea in children in neighbourhoods with drainage was less than two-thirds, and in neighbourhoods with drainage and sewerage less than one-third, of the incidence in neighbourhoods with neither. After controlling for potential confounders, the proportion of children with 'frequent diarrhoea' showed the same significant trend across the study groups. Though the groups were not exactly comparable, more than one child was monitored per household, and it was not possible to rotate fieldworkers between study groups, the study provides evidence that community sanitation can have an impact on diarrhoeal disease, even without measures to promote hygiene behaviour.","Introduction There has been increasing concern in recent years that excreta disposal has been neglected in comparison with water supply in the developing world, and that as a result the extension of coverage with sanitation has lagged behind (WHO/ UNICEF, 2000) . Excreta disposal is one of the primary barriers to the transmission of faeco-oral infections, and it has been argued that sanitation has a greater impact on health than water supply (Bateman, 1991; Esrey et al., 1991) . Better evidence of the health benefits of sanitation is an essential requirement of the advocacy needed to improve this situation. Unfortunately, most of the existing evidence comes from observational studies which compare households which have installed latrines with others which have not. They are therefore based on self-selected exposure groups and are thus beset by serious problems of confounding by socio-economic status (Cairncross, 1990) and hygiene awareness (Hoque et al., 1995) . As their unit of study is the individual household, they neglect the substantial externalities in terms of the additional health benefits which accrue when sanitation is improved for the community as a whole (Bateman & Smith, 1991) . Most of the studies also relate to rural settings, whereas the health impacts of sanitation are likely to be greater in the urban areas in which half of the world's population now live (Esrey & Sommerfelt, 1991) . We report the results of a study of the health impact of environmental sanitation in poor urban areas in Salvador, Brazil, considering diarrhoeal disease as an indicator.Methods and Study PopulationStudy site and intervention The study was conducted in 1989-90 in the Camurujipe Valley, an area of Salvador in north-east Brazil with a number of informal low-income settlements. In the early 1980s, the Municipality of Salvador constructed low-cost surface water drainage systems (which are used also for sewage disposal) in 17 of 34 Address for correspondence: Prof. Sandy Cairncross, Department of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Keppel Street, London WC1E 7HT, UK; fax +44 (0)20 7636 7843, e-mail sandy'caimcr°ss@lshtm'ac'uk neighbourhoods. In the mid-1980s, they constructed simplified sewerage systems in 11 others. These measures were accompanied by paving of some streets and, in some areas, by improvements in the water distribution system and by giving the residents land tenure. By the time the project funds were fully spent, 6 neighbourhoods had still not been provided with either drainage or sewerage. It had been planned to cover all 34 with both services, but unfortunately this did not prove financially possible. This pattern of sanitation development thus resulted in 3 groups of communities, those with sewerage and drainage, those with drainage only, and those without either. Communities were not allocated randomly to these groups but selected on politico-administrative criteria. The explicit criteria for selection of priority neighbourhoods for intervention were ease of access for construction, area occupied, current lack of basic services, level of community organization, type of housing, proportion of households with low and casual incomes, and physical characteristics such as vulnerability to flooding or landslides. No health criteria were utilized. In practice, however, political patronage and pressure from construction firms preferring to work in the easiest terrain also played a part. Simplified sewerage systems were added to the intervention when the programme was already under way, so that the first 17 neighbourhoods selected did not benefit from them. We believe that, in practice, socioeconomic status, environmental quality and health status played little part in the selection of the communities to benefit from the programme; we investigated and controlled for differences in group characteristics in the assessment of health impact. The drainage system installed in this area was characterized by a system of rainwater drainage channels made from prefabricated components of reinforced concrete. They are covered and also serve as footpaths or stairways (Fig. 1 ). Lateral openings allow for the entry of surface water and sewage connections from nearby houses. They are connected to large, lined interceptor drainage channels which discharge into the Camurujipe River. The simplified sewerage system, where installed, involved 100 mm diameter plastic pipes laid at a shallow depth along either side of the channel, discharging into the same interceptors. House connections were the same size, with simplified junction boxes and usually a grit and grease trap.Selection of study population, and consultation Three groups of 3 neighbourhoods, 9 in all, were chosen from the full list of 34 by stratified random sampling, according to the environmental infrastructure available: group 3 consisted of 3 neighbourhoods which had both drainage and simplified sewerage systems throughout; group 2 consisted of 3 with drainage systems used for both purposes; and group 1 (the control) consisted of 3 with no intervention. In each selected neighbourhood, about 120 households were randomly selected, with the objective of recruiting a nominal 130 children aged < 5 years from each community. Further details are given in Moraes (1996) . Public meetings were held in each neighbourhood to explain the nature and purpose of the research and to seek the residents' collective consent. A total of 66 such meetings were held before and during the study.Social and environmental data collection A pre-coded questionnaire was administered at the beginning of the fieldwork to each selected household to collect information on socio-economic, demographic, cultural, environmental and health aspects. The questionnaire included information on the family members, breastfeeding, weaning practices, diarrhoea episodes in children aged < 5 years, environmental and household sanitation, and socio-economic status. Housing characteristics included the number of rooms, area, floor, walls, roof, electricity, and water supply, storage and usage. The questionnaire also included excreta and sullage disposal and solid waste disposal facilities; all sites within 10 m of the house door with visible sewage on the ground, sewage overflowing from stairways, or rubbish were observed and counted; any reported increase of vectors during the last year (rats, cockroaches and flies) was noted; income, religion and ownership of goods (a radio, a refrigerator, a television and the house plot) were also recorded. The questionnaire was administered by the 9 trained female fieldworkers, who were residents of the neighbourhoods they covered, as it was dangerous for outsiders to walk about at all hours. The compliance of the respondents was over 98%.Diarrhoeal morbidity A 2-week 'calendar' designed for use by illiterate adults, and bearing a photograph of each child aged < 5 years, was used to avoid recall bias while keeping to only one home visit per week. Mothers were encouraged to record diarrhoea episodes on these. In this study 'diarrhoea' was defined for all children aged < 5 years as looser than usual stool consistency and increased frequency, as noted by their mothers or guardians. The fieldworker also interviewed the mothers every 2 weeks about each episode of diarrhoea in their children; an episode was defined as 1 or more days of diarrhoea separated from any other episode by at least 2 diarrhoea symptom-free days (Morris et al., 1994) . This information was collected over a period of 1 year. During this period, all children who reached the age of 60 months or moved away were dropped from the study and all children born in the study households were enrolled.Quality control measures Each questionnaire and each completed form or diarrhoea calendar from the field was reviewed by the field supervisor and the quality control officer. A subsample of 10% of these were then reviewed by the principal investigator. Only 3% of the questionnaires were returned to the field to correct and complete. During the diarrhoea monitoring, unannounced household visits were carried out by the field supervisors and by the principal investigator to check that the calendars were being duly completed. Each household was visited at least twice per fortnight.Data handling and analysis Additional quality control checks were performed before and after data entry. The analyses of the data were conducted using SPSS/PC+ 4.0.1. (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Incidence rates, expressed as episodes per child per year, were computed from the ratio between the number of new episodes occurring and the number of childfortnights of observation obtained from the calendars. Incidence rates were compared by calculating the incidence density ratio (IDR), which is the incidence rate experienced in one study group divided by the incidence rate in another. Test-based 95% CIs for the IDR (Kleinbaum et al., 1982) were calculated, although these confidence limits should be interpreted with some caution because repeated episodes of diarrhoea in a child are not always independent events. Logistic regression analysis was used to study the combined effects of several potential confounding factors and of study group. The analysis followed the approach used by Aziz et al. (1990) , and the observed number of episodes that a child experienced in a year was compared to the expected number of episodes for a child of the same age group and followed-up over the same time period in the year, eliminating the age and seasonal effects in the calculations. Those children who had more than twice the expected number of episodes were classified as a 'frequent diarrhoea' group. The proportion of children classified as having 'frequent diarrhoea' was compared between the 3 study groups. The method used in the logistic regression was forced entry, by which all variables are entered in a single step (Norusis, 1990) .ResultsCharacteristics of the study population At the beginning of the study 1162 children aged < 5 years were living in 732 of 1005 households surveyed in the 9 neighbourhoods. In addition, 113 children in the same households born during the 12-month follow-up diarrhoeal study were incorporated in to the study, resulting in 1275 children aged < 5 years studied in the period from November 1989 to November 1990. The mean age of the children was 27.9 months at recruitment to the study, and 52.4% of them were male. In all 3 study groups there were slightly more children in the age group < 12 months than in the other 12-month intervals due to the continued recruitment of newborns. No significant differences were found between the study groups regarding the age and gender distributions of the children.Characteristics of the three study groups Table 1 compares the 3 study groups, separating the variables likely to have been affected by the environmental improvements from those which were independent of them. No significant differences between the 3 groups were observed in access to electricity, number of bedrooms, household size, religion, animals in house and type of water supply. A number of differences between households in the control group (no intervention) and the other study groups arose from the fact that the former were more recently established settlements. Half of the mothers in the control group originated from rural areas compared to a quarter in the drainage group and a third in the group which also had sewerage. Households in the intervention areas had a longer mean duration of residence (17.4 years) than in the control areas (11.2 years) (P < 0.001). The mean level of schooling of the household heads in the control group was less than in the other study groups (P < 0.001). This was also true of the mothers, who also tended to be younger in the control group. No significant differences were found between the study groups regarding the household heads' and mothers' occupations. Most of the heads worked as construction workers, security guards, lorry drivers or as manual labourers, while the mothers, if employed, were engaged as domestic workers or as casual workers in the local service industries. There were significant differences between the 2 intervention groups and the control group, attributable to the intervention. Excreta and sullage disposal were better and more streets were paved in the intervention groups (P < 0.001), and this made an improved rubbish collection service possible. The number of sites within 10 m of the house door where sewage was visible on the ground or where rubbish had accumulated was highest in the control and lowest in the sewerage group (P < 0.001). The reliability of water supply distribution was also better in the intervention groups than in the control group (P < 0.001). Such differences were to be expected in view of the nature of the interventions. To the extent that a factor may have predisposed some communities to receive the intervention, while itself being directly associated with better health status, it was a potential confounding factor. If, however, it was a consequence of the intervention, then any improvement in health status it bestowed could be considered to be a health benefit of the intervention itself. The 3 study groups, while being of low-income population, presented several differences in socio-economic, cultural and environmental aspects, and this had some implications when comparing them. The health impact assessment analysis took these differences into account.Comparison between study groups Table 2 shows that the overall incidence of diarrhoea in the control group was more than 3 times that in the sewerage group, with the 'drainage only' group in an intermediate position. There was also a significant difference in incidence rates between the 2 intervention groups; children living in neighbourhoods with a sewerage system experienced half as many episodes of diarrhoea as those living in neighbourhoods with only drainage. The prevalence--the mean percentage of days that children had diarrhoea--fell progressively from group to group in the same way, representing a significant difference when the groups were compared. Persistent episodes (those lasting more than 14 d) accounted for only a very small proportion of all episodes in the 3 study groups, and less than 17% of diarrhoea days.Controlling for confounding facwrs As noted above, there were differences between the 3 groups, some of which could be associated with the risk of diarrhoeal disease. The factors that showed significant associations with diarrhoea and were not considered to be consequences of improved environmental sanitation were the child's age, gender and birth order, the number of children in the household aged < 5 years, crowding, mother's education, monthly per capita income, exclusive use of kitchen, animals in the house, presence of a washstand, water usage and house floor material. These factors were selected as potential confounding variables for inclusion in the multivariate logistic regression analysis, which was then used to control for their combined effects on the association between diarrhoea and environmental sanitation. Variables which were not significantly associated with diarrhoea (such as rural vs. urban origin) were not used in that analysis. The outcome variable used was 'frequent diarrhoea' (more than twice the expected number of episodes). Complete data for analysis were available for 961 children. Table 3 shows the results in the form of unadjusted (crude) and adjusted odds ratios (ORs). The OR was roughly equivalent to the ratio between 2 study groups of the risks to children of having 'frequent diarrhoea', other things being equal. The study groups were compared with the least exposed group (the group with both drainage and sewerage), so that an OR greater than unity implied that the association with the risk factor was in the expected direction. After adjustment for potential confounders, the estimated ORs were slightly lower than the crude values, but the association between diarrhoea incidence and environmental sanitation (excreta and sullage disposal) remained highly significant (P < 0.0001).Age-and gender-specific impact Age-specific diarrhoeal morbidity measures were calculated, and the overall incidence rates are shown in Fig. 2 . The difference between age groups was most marked, and consistently in the expected direction, in children aged > 12 months but not so clear in infancy.  CThe two-sided normal test was used for all quantitative variables, and X 2 (or Fisher's exact test) for all others: NS, not significant at 5% level; *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ~***P < 0.0005. The difference between study groups was similar for males and females.Individual household sanitation Most of the children (87.8%) were in households with flush toilets, though in the control group these discharged into the street. Most of the remainder (9.5%) had no excreta disposal facility, although 2.7% had pit latrines. Diarrhoea incidence among children in households with a flush toilet was 3.02 episodes/child/ year, significantly less (P < 0.001) than the incidence (6.19 episodes/child/year) among those with with no facility at all. Among those with pit latrines, the incidence was 4.34 episodes/child/year.Discussion The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of environmental sanitation on diarrhoeal at FundaÃ §Ã£o CoordenaÃ §Ã£o de AperfeiÃ §oamento de Pessoal de NÃ-vel Superior on January 13, 2014 http://trstmh.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from  morbidity in young children. The incidence of diarrhoea was consistently lower in the groups with improved community sanitation throughout the study period, and lowest in the group with the fullest provision-sewerage and drainage systems. The sewerage and drainage systems still had a significant effect on diarrhoeal morbidity after controlling for confounding factors. The incidence of diarrhoea in the group with a sewerage and drainage system (group 3) was one-third, and in the group with a drainage system only (group 2) it was two-thirds, of that in the group lacking sanitation infrastructure (group 1). The intervention groups enjoyed a slightly more reliable water supply service than the control group, but it is unlikely that the differences we describe were principally attributable to that, for 2 reasons. First, there was little difference in continuity of the water supply between the 2 intervention groups, but the group with a full sewerage system had substantially less diarrhoea. Second, we controlled for water usage as one of the potential confounding factors. Children in the same household were not statistically independent. On average there were 1.74 children in the study per household. However, the differences between the study groups would still be significant if half of the children were dropped from the study to leave at FundaÃ §Ã£o CoordenaÃ §Ã£o de AperfeiÃ §oamento de Pessoal de NÃ-vel Superior on January 13, 2014 http://trstmh.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from only one child per household, as can be seen from the confidence intervals in Tables 2 and 3 . Repeated bouts of diarrhoea in a single child were also not independent, but that problem did not affect the analysis of the risk of 'frequent diarrhoea' (Table 3 ). The difference in diarrhoea incidence between the study groups was unlikely to be due to observer bias. Although each fieldworker was a resident of her community and it was not possible to interchange observers or rotate them between communities, the consistency of their data was supported by the fact that the incidence of diarrhoea in the 3 individual communities within each environmental sanitation group was not significantly different. The study had some methodological limitations, including the absence of preintervention data and the small number of communities (3) in each group. We attempted to address this through the control of confounding variables in the data analysis. Furthermore, the magnitude of the effect observed and the 'dose-response' effect seen according to type of sanitation, lead us to conclude that improved environmental sanitation can have a positive impact on diarrhoeal morbidity in young children in poor periurban areas such as those studied. This might not seem a new conclusion, as the health benefits of sanitation have been documented before (Esrey et al., 1991) . However, much of the existing evidence for the impact of sanitation on diarrhoeal disease is weak as it is based on self-selected exposure groups and is not safe from the possibility of confounding by socio-economic status, awareness of hygiene, or any other factor which predisposes individual households to install a family toilet (Cairncross, 1990; Cairncross & Kolsky 1997) . Moreover, such studies neglect the amplification of impact which is likely to result when a whole community benefits from sanitation improvements, and the important degree to which diarrhoea is transmitted in the public environment, as compared with the household, when community sanitation infrastructure is lacking (Koopman, 1980) . It is noteworthy that the crude ratio of diarrhoea incidence between households having a latrine and those without was 2, but that this increased to more than 3 (Table 2 ) when the comparison was made between whole communities with sanitation infrastructure (sewerage and drainage) and those with none. The difference in the peak age of diarrhoea incidence between the sewerage and the control groups (Fig. 2 ) suggested that the component of diarrhoea transmission which was prevented by the environmental sanitation was largely among children aged > 1 year rather than among infants; this is not surprising, as children aged > 1 year are more likely to play in the street and be exposed to the faecal contamination of the environment in the public domain (Cairncross et al., 1996) than infants. Differences in the proportion of persistent episodes could be due to differential impact on persistent, relative to acute diarrhoea; but the number of persistent episodes in each study group was too small (< 40 in each group) to draw firm conclusions. Contrary to what has been suggested in one recent study (Esrey, 1996) and in recent debates in Brazil about the national level of coverage with sanitation (Anonymous, 2000) , the impact of sanitation in individual households was not significantly affected by the type of toilet; there was no significant difference in the incidence of diarrhoea between households with a cistern-flush toilet and a rudimentary pit latrine, though the number of households with pit latrines was too small to detect small differences. The present study has demonstrated that community sanitation infrastructure can have a significant impact on diarrhoeal disease, even without any significant measures to promote hygiene behaviour changes within the household. Further study of the mechanisms un-derlying this impact would help to define the mixture of environmental infrastructure and health promotion interventions likely to produce the greatest health benefit.at Fig.1.

Globally, about 1 billion people practice open defecation, and an estimated 2.4 billion people were living without improved sanitation facilities in 2015. Much of the previous research investigating the effect of improved sanitation has been based on observational studies.

This preventable and curable disease accounts for 11 % of child mortality [2] . The lack of improved sanitation is the most important contributing factor to diarrheal disease in many low-income countries [3] . During the Millennium Campaign period, sanitation coverage has not progressed as planned and remains a daunting challenge for the next campaign of the Sustainable Development Goals [4, 5] . Globally, approximately 1 billion people practice open defecation, and an estimated 2.4 billion people lived without improved sanitation facilities in 2015 [1] . Sub-Saharan Africa showed slower progress in sanitation coverage, reaching 31 % in 2015 from 24 % in 1990, whereas South Asia has increased coverage to 49 % from 22 % in the same period [1] . Inequality in coverage also exists between rural and urban areas. In contrast with 40 % of the urban population accessing improved sanitation in sub-Saharan countries, only 23 % of people in rural areas have access to improved sanitation [1] . Ethiopia shows a high child mortality rate, with 74.4 children out of 1,000 live births dying before they reached the age of five in 2013. Diarrheal disease accounts for 9 % of child mortality, ranking as the fourth most frequent cause of child deaths [6] . In Ethiopia, 72 % of the people are living without improved sanitation facilities [7] . Much of the previous research investigating the effect of improved sanitation has been based on observational studies [8] [9] [10] [11] . According to the results of a recent systematic review [12] , few studies have involved a clusterrandomized controlled trial on sanitation intervention. Recently, several studies [13] [14] [15] have investigated the effect of improved sanitation, executing a clusterrandomized controlled trial. These studies did not demonstrate any protective effect of improved latrines against child diarrheal prevalence. However, none of the recent studies achieved universal or even a sufficient level of coverage required for fostering herd immunity. Without universal or at least a sufficient level of latrine coverage, the effect of improved latrines on the prevention of diarrheal disease is difficult to determine. Furthermore, most of the recent studies employing rigorous methodology have been conducted in South Asia. Since a number of people are living without improved sanitation in sub-Saharan Africa, a strong need exists for further evidence of the effect of improved sanitation in rural sub-Saharan Africa. This study aims to explore the net effect of improved latrines on reducing diarrhea in children under five, particularly when latrine coverage reaches a certain threshold level. In addition, we aim to investigate the effect of improved latrines on the diarrheal duration of children by recording diarrheal incidence on a daily basis. This study was designed as a cluster-randomized trial in the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' Region (the SNNPR State), Ethiopia, with the aim of finding evidence of the effect of improved latrines on diarrheal diseases in children under five. To our knowledge, this is the second study to assess the effects of improved latrines on child diarrheal reduction through the application of Community-Led Total Sanitation.Methods/designStudy setting The Cheha District and Enemore Ena Ener District, the target area of the project, are located 185 km southwest of Addis Ababa. According to the District Statistics Office, the total population of each district was 133,233 and 204,937, respectively, in 2014. Both districts are predominantly rural areas with 90 % of the entire land used for farming, and the major sources of income are crop production and livestock farming. Coffee, chat, and oil seeds are among the major cash crops in both districts, and plantations of eucalyptus trees for income are also very common. The dominant ethnic group, which accounts for more than 80 % of the population in the area, is the Gurage people, after which the administrative zone of the area is named (Gurage Zone). Of the population in the area, 64 % are Muslim, whereas 33 % identified themselves as Ethiopian Orthodox Christian (Fig. 1 ).Study design The study was approved by the National Research Ethics Review Committee under the Ministry of Science and Technology, Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia (NRERC 3.10/032/2015; July 29, 2015) and was registered as an ISRCT on March 13, 2015 (ISRCTN82492848). In the study, a gott, the Amharic word for village, was taken as the randomization unit because we expected that improved latrines could impact diarrheal transmission across households within a gott, where people interact with one another most closely. All the interventions related to latrine improvement will be performed at each gott level. A phase-in and factorial design will be used for the study. The intervention for improving latrines will be implemented in the intervention arm during the first phase, and the comparable intervention will be performed in the control arm during the second phase. During the second phase, a water pipe will be connected to the gotts in the intervention arm. After the second phase is completed, the control group will receive the intervention of a water pipe connection. With the design, we will investigate not only the effect of improved sanitation but also the combined effects of improved water and sanitation interventions. A preliminary survey was carried out to develop this water, sanitation, and hygiene (WaSH) project intervention design in March to May 2013. Water pipes will be connected to 212 gotts, of which, 48 gotts were selected as the study area of the trial. In the intervention gotts, the procedures of the Community-Led Total Sanitation including pre-triggering, triggering, and follow-up will be carried out for latrine improvement beginning in November 2015 and will continue to October 2016.Primary endpoint The primary endpoint of the study is diarrheal prevalence in children under 5 years of age. We will use 7-day prevalence of reported diarrhea in the household, which will be based on parental reports. The survey will be conducted five times at the household level: the first four rounds will be carried out in the first phase to explore the effect of improved latrines, and the last one, in the second phase to assess the combined effects of improved water and sanitation. In addition to diarrheal prevalence, we will measure diarrheal incidence and diarrheal duration. For documentation of diarrheal incidence and duration, we will have the mother or caregiver record the diarrheal episodes of her youngest child on a ""Sanitation Calendar"" (Amharic language: Yenezehenna Gize Saleda) on a daily basis (Fig. 2 ).Sample size calculationPeriod prevalence of diarrhea The prevalence of diarrhea was estimated to be 24 % on the basis of a preliminary survey in the SNNPR State, and we expect that our intervention will lead to a 30 % relative reduction on the basis of systematic review results [16] . Assuming a design effect of 2.14 and a coefficient of variation of 0.15, an 80 % study power resulted in 48 clusters (48 gotts) and 600 children per arm. We employed a two-stage cluster-sampling method for the study. Among the 212 gotts targeted by the project for the water pipe connection, 48 gotts were chosen as primary sampling units.Incidence density of diarrhea in terms of child-weeks The expected value of the incidence density, E (s 2 ), is given by E s 2 À Á ¼ λAv 1=y j þ σ 2 c ¼ λAv 1=y j þ k 2 λ 2 ; where λ is the true mean rate, y j corresponds to the child-weeks of follow-up in the j th cluster, Av() indicates the mean overall clusters, σ c 2 is the between-cluster variance of the true rates, and k is the coefficient of variation of those rates [17] . Based on the preliminary survey, the overall diarrheal rate in the 48 gotts was 0.18 (or 18 cases per 100 child-weeks). The empirical standard deviation of the observed diarrhea rates was 0.092189, and the average of the reciprocal child-weeks per neighborhood was 0.001667. Therefore, k was estimated as σ 2 ¼ 0:092189 2 -0:18 Â 0:001667 ¼ 0:008199; and therefore; k ¼ √ 0:008199=0:18 ð Þ ¼ 0:213422: We assumed that the diarrhea rate in the control gotts remained constant at λ 0 = 0.18, and we required 90 % power (z β = 1.28) if the intervention reduced the diarrhea rate by 21 %. Assuming 600 child-weeks of observation (24 weeks of follow-up for 25 children) in each gott, the number of neighborhoods required for each treatment group is given by c = 1 + (1.96 + 0.28) 2 [(0.18 + 0.1422)/ 600 + 0. 213422 2 (0. 18 2 + 0. 1422 2 )]/(0.18 -0.1422) 2 = 22.55.Household sampling methods A list of households with children under 5 years of age was established by four supervisors in each gott before the baseline survey. Supervisors required 8 days to produce a complete household list for all 48 gotts. Using SPSS 21 Statistics software, the survey team leader randomly sampled 25 households from each gott. Enumerators will recruit the youngest child under five from each household, from the fifth week of October through the second week of November 2015. If the mother or a household caregiver is absent at the time of the recruitment visit, the enumerator will revisit the same household two more times. If the mother or caregiver refused to be registered, a neighboring household with a child under 5 was visited to replace the household (Fig. 3 ).Eligibility criteria and randomization The criteria for gott-level eligibility were (1) the lowest coverage of improved sanitation, (2) the lowest coverage of improved water, (3) similar population size, (4) similar distance from the main road, (5) road accessibility, (6) sufficient number of households with an under-five child, (7) sufficient distance between study gotts to prevent contamination, and (8) no other WaSH projects are to be implemented during the study period. To select eligible gotts for the study, we used the data from the preliminary survey and from the special survey for the water pipe connection. The preliminary survey was carried out in March through May 2013, and the special survey was conducted in August 2014 in 212 gotts across the two target districts. The criteria for household level eligibility are (1) having a child under 60 months at the time of recruitment and (2) agreeing to register with informed consent. The age of a child will be verified with an immunization card, which shows the birth date of the child. Informed consent from 1200 households registered will be obtained from the mother or caregiver in written form. A structured questionnaire will be administered regarding water, sanitation, and hygiene, including demographics and socioeconomic characteristics. The gotts in the study area were stratified according to the administrative unit (kebelle, in Amharic, which is the administrative unit above the gott) so that every kebelle contained both intervention and control gotts. By doing so, we were able to increase the balance between the intervention and control arms because gotts in the same kebelle were expected to have more common characteristics in terms of economic status, tribe, religion, geographical conditions such as altitude, and WaSH-related behaviors. In addition, local government officials of the study area also requested that we allocate the same number of study gotts in each kebelle to prevent any conflicts of interest among the kebelles. To avoid contamination, we allocated a buffer zone between the intervention and control gotts in every kebelle. A closed cohort design will be employed for the study. Any new baby born during the longitudinal survey period will not enrolled for the study.Intervention In alignment with the National Hygiene and Sanitation Strategic Action Plan (2011-2015) [18] , the Ethiopian Government's policy on sanitation, we applied the principles of Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) for the study. The Gurage zonal office, the SNNPR State of Ethiopia, and the Re-shaping Development Institute (ReDI) are implementing the project. The project is funded by the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA).CLTS implementation In accordance with the Ethiopian government's guidelines on this issue, the primary approach for implementation of latrine improvement and hygiene promotion adopted for this program is Community-Led Total Sanitation. Of 48 gotts selected in the project area, 24 gotts in the project area were selected (intervention arm) and will receive the CLTS intervention and undergo intensive follow-up throughout the first phase of the implementation period (approximately 12 months) for latrine improvement. As the first step of CLTS, a team of trained CLTS facilitators will conduct the triggering process in each of these 24 gotts. During this triggering process, facilitators will use participatory tools, such as transect walk, sanitation mapping, and calculating feces deposition to help community members realize the health effects of open defecation practices in their gotts. In the process, basic human emotions, including shame and disgust, will be aroused among the gott members regarding their own defecation practices. Successfully implemented, the triggering activities of the CLTS, which normally take half a day for each gott, can be a very effective tool to motivate community members to stop  In accordance with the core principle of CLTS, no material or financial subsidies will be provided for the construction of individual household latrines. Household members will take responsibility for the whole process of latrine construction including (1) pit-hole digging; (2) constructing a slab and pit-hole cover; (3) constructing the walls, door, and roof; and (4) installing handwashing facilities. The community member's labor cost for construction of a latrine is expected to be approximately US$5.95 (125 Ethiopian birr as of October 23, 2015) per household. Ten full days of labor are estimated to be required for the construction of an improved latrine per household if two adults were to work together for the procurement of materials (wood, thatch, stone, and so on) and construction of the latrines. We produced an operational definition for an improved latrine for the project as having (1) a pit-hole with at least 2.5 m of depth, (2) a slab, (3) a pit-hole cover, (4) a superstructure, (5) a door, (6) a roof, and (7) hand-washing facilities (Fig. 4 ). We did not prescribe the materials for any component of the latrine, expecting those to be locally available and affordable materials to ensure sustainability. If a latrine lacks any of the elements specified above, it would not qualify as an improved latrine.WaSH promoter At the beginning of the implementation period, one (1) villager from each intervention gott be designated and trained as a WaSH promoter to carry out posttriggering or follow-up CLTS activities in his/her gott. To ensure the coverage and quality construction of the latrines in each gott, and also the long-term utilization of the latrines to be built, these WaSH promoters will employ a combination of various approaches including technical advice on latrine construction, collective awarenessraising, and household visits. For this purpose, during the initial phase of implementation, WaSH promoters in each gott will be trained on key issues regarding latrine construction and use. Once trained, these WaSH promoters are to be the leading agents to promote and follow-up on the latrine improvement and sanitation-related behavior change in the promoter's respective Gott. More specifically, WaSH promoters will be responsible for activities including household visits, community conversations, technical advice on latrine design, organization of and participation in monthly review meetings with stakeholders, and so on. In line with the Ethiopian government's CLTS Guideline, no material subsidies will be provided for the construction of individual household latrines. Instead, most of the resources, both human and financial, of the project are to be allocated for activities aimed at promotion of latrine construction and use, as well as the sanitation behavior change of the community.Water intervention When the CLTS intervention is completed, the second phase starts, during which water pipes will be connected to 24 gotts from one single spring on a mountain in each district. A spring capable of supplying sufficient water across the district is already identified and designing a water-pipe connection plan is under process. Immediately after the final round of the survey is finished, the water pipe will be connected to all the other 24 gotts.Sanitation mapping To assess the progress of latrine uptake, a sanitation map will be drawn and updated on a monthly basis. In addition to the households recruited for the longitudinal household survey, all the households in the 48 gotts will be registered to assess the real-time latrine status. All the households in the 48 gotts will be endowed with an identity number and marked with red, yellow, or green. If a household completes construction of an improved latrine, the WaSH promoter will mark that household in green on the sanitation map. If the latrine is under construction, that household will be marked in yellow. If the uptake of an improved latrine does not occur, the household will be marked in red on the sanitation map. Each WaSH promoter will present the sanitation map for his/her gott during a monthly review meeting of WaSH promoters, which is intended to stimulate healthy competition between the gotts. A system of evaluation and reward at the gott level is established, and this system is expected to create peer-pressure within the gott. WaSH promoters will educate gott residents on the herd immunity effects [19] of improved latrines and the importance of universal or sufficient coverage of improved latrines. If a gott reaches 80 % improved latrine coverage, it will be as a ""healthy gott"" by the local government and will be rewarded by the project team. Material rewards will be given to both WaSH promoters individually and to those gotts collectively that show fast progress in improved latrine uptake.Scoring latrine improvement status by household For the assessment of improved latrine coverage in each gott, only the households with improved latrines will be counted. Households not practicing open defecation, but using communal or neighbor's latrines will not be counted in the latrine coverage assessment. To avoid subjectivity of WaSH promoters in categorizing the realtime status of latrine uptake, photos will be taken of a latrine by WaSH promoters and will be assessed and scored by supervisors and the team leader. Direct observation will be made, especially of the latrine construction, utilization, and open defecation status. As for the latrine status, we will not only observe the presence of latrines but will also assess the latrine type for categorization by each element (e.g., pit more than 2.5 m deep, slab, pit-hole cover, superstructure/ wall, roof, door, and hand-washing facility within 3 m of the latrine). To evaluate latrine utilization, odor, a spider web at the entrance, fresh feces, and a worn path to the latrine will be observed. To evaluate for ongoing open defecation, the presence of human feces around the household compound and in the gott will be observed. In addition, to avoid measurement errors, 3-m-long sticks marked every 50 cm will be provided to WaSH promoters to measure the pit-hole depth. The presence of wet feces around the pit-hole and a spider-web at the entrance, and a worn path to the latrine will be observed to assess latrine utilization.Health outcome assessment with a sanitation calendar We distributed a sanitation calendar to all registered households beginning in December 2015 and asked mothers or caregivers to mark ""O"" or ""X"" depending on the presence of diarrheal disease of her youngest child every day over the 12-month period of longitudinal observation from December 2015 to November 2016. WaSH promoters have been monitoring the recording status of the sanitation calendar on a weekly basis and continue to educate and encourage mothers or caregivers to continue recording appropriately. We devised an incentive mechanism to encourage the mothers or caregivers to record diarrheal episodes on the sanitation calendar properly by establishing a system where a well-maintained calendar can be used as a voucher. A well-recorded calendar, regardless of whether it contains Os or Xs will be exchanged with a gift-in-kind, probably sanitation-related materials such as soaps, nail clippers, toothpastes, or the like. WaSH promoters will take a photo of the sanitation calendar using a mobile phone and submit to a supervisor and the team leader. For the study, diarrhea is defined as three or more watery stools in 24 hours according to the WHO definition.Intermediate outcomesSanitary survey In each of the five rounds of the household survey (October 2015; March, July and November 2016; and July 2017), the presence of feces both inside and outside the household compound, and within the gott will be observed. The practices of child feces disposal will also be assessed by administering a structured questionnaire and observation.Fly counts Flies are known to be key vectors transmitting diarrheal pathogens from human feces. We will count the number of flies with glue traps. For all five rounds of the household survey, enumerators will be provided with glue traps of the same length per each household, and they will hang them around the pit-hole of a latrine, if any, before starting the interview. The enumerators will count the number of flies stuck on the glue traps after 30 minutes (Fig. 5 ).Data analysis We will conduct intention-to-treat analysis to assess the effects of improved latrines on child diarrheal reduction. For the main independent variables, the incidence density, 7-day recall period prevalence, and diarrheal duration will be calculated. We will use generalized estimating equations to investigate the effect at the cluster level and a logbinomial model to calculate the incidence rate of diarrhea. Taking into consideration the between-cluster variation by assuming that there are cluster-level effects, we will use the random effects model. We will also conduct a multilevel analysis to explore the effects of coverage of a gott on the diarrheal incidence of an individual. (Coverage is defined as low if it is below 33 %; medium, 33-66 %; and high, above 66 %).Discussion This study seeks to assess the effects of improved sanitation on the health gains of children under 5 years of age and to explore the behavioral factors associated with latrine improvement. Several studies [13] [14] [15] have been conducted for a similar purpose with rigorous methodology in South Asian countries; however, those studies failed to reach universal or sufficient coverage of improved latrines. Furthermore, the results of recent randomized controlled trials cannot represent the effect of Community-Led Total Sanitation because they provided material or financial subsidies, although these were to the marginalized groups in the community. For example, a recent study [20] on improved sanitation, conducted in Bangladesh, revealed that subsidies could increase latrine ownership both in subsidized and unsubsidized households; however, those authors did not investigate the effects of the approaches for latrine improvement on scalability and sustainability, nor did they explore the effects on maintenance. For this study, we strictly applied the main principle of Community-Led Total Sanitation, paying close attention to the potential for scalability and sustainability. In the trial, community members will fully contribute to constructing their own household latrines, including digging a pit-hole; obtaining materials for the slab, pit-hole cover, walls, and roof; and completing installation. For the study, a sanitation calendar has been devised to track child diarrhea more efficiently. We estimate the incidence density of diarrhea. With the sanitation calendar, the potential of recall bias [21] and respondent fatigue [22] due to frequent visits, which were the limitations of previous studies, are expected be reduced. Moreover, the sanitation calendar will help us to investigate the effects of improved sanitation on the duration of diarrheal diseases through the daily recording of diarrheal episodes. Assessing the effects of improved sanitation on the diarrheal duration has continuously been recommended as a future study topic in previous studies. To ensure objectivity and avoid information bias, latrine improvement status will be photographed with tablet PCs or mobile phones provided to enumerators and WaSH promoters. Assessments of the latrine improvement status will be made by supervisors and team leaders, not by the enumerators or WaSH promoters, which helps avoid overestimating the coverage of improved latrines. Latrine improvement status will be scored on the basis of the photos taken. Using the scored results, the degree of the effects of the improved latrines will be explored according to the improved status. To avoid contamination between the intervention and control gotts in the same kebelle, we excluded any neighboring gotts of either intervention or control gotts from selection, thus making those gotts serve as a buffer zone [23] . In this trial, keeping records on the sanitation calendar is one of the most important features. In order to encourage mothers or caregivers to record diarrheal incidence every day, WaSH promoters will visit registered households on a weekly basis. The sanitation calendar will be photographed on this visit, and the supervisors and team leader will randomly revisit some of the households to verify the results. The system of encouragement and verification will be strictly maintained, particularly during the first 2 months of the intervention period, so the mothers or caregivers of registered households will be familiar with recording cases of diarrhea. A community meeting will be convened every month, and the WaSH promoter will correct substantial errors related to sanitation calendar utilization. Our intervention is not to provide any financial nor material subsidy to community members. Rather, our intervention is to encourage community members to construct latrines for their own household members using locally available materials. We strictly comply with the key principles of Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS). Therefore, like all the previous studies, we have similar limitations such as the possibility of insufficient coverage. This study will provide sound evidence for determining the effects of improved latrines on the prevalence,Fig. 1 1 Fig. 1 Project area and study areaFig. 2 2 Fig. 2 Sanitation calendarFig. 3 3 Fig.3 diagramFig. 4 4 Fig. 4 Model latrineFig. 5 5 Fig. 5 Fly trap"," Jung S, Doh YA, Bizuneh DB, Beyene H, Seong J, Kwon H, et al.

We aimed to investigate patient impact of patient education using objective assessments of adherence. Methods: A 14-month randomised, prospective clinical trial of adherence to mesalamine was conducted in 248 patients with ulcerative colitis [UC], Colitis Activity Index [CAI] ≤ 9, receiving standard care [n = 122] versus a standardised patient education programme [n = 126]. Primary endpoint was adherence at all visits (5-aminosalicylic acid [5-ASA] urine levels). Secondary endpoints included quality of life (inflammatory bowel disease questionnaise [IBDQ]), disease activity, partial adherence, and self-assessment of adherence. Results: Patient allocation was well balanced. Baseline non-adherence was high in quiescent/ mildly active UC [52.4%] without difference between the groups (52.4% of patients in the education group versus 52.5% in the standard care group [p = 0.99]). No difference between the intervention group and standard care was seen in IBDQ, partial adherence, self-assessment of adherence, or therapy satisfaction at all visits. We suggest a model in which individual risks for non-adherence are driven by patients with young age, short disease duration, and low education levels. Conclusions: Non-adherence is frequent in a population with quiescent/mildly active UC. Although more than 25% of the population was not in remission at the various time points, no relationship between disease activity and adherence was seen over the 14-month observation period. Physicians should maximise their efforts to motivate high-risk patients for adherence. Future trials should use objective exposure assessments to examine the impact of continuous education and consultations on the background of individual risks to develop non-adherence.","Background Ulcerative colitis [UC] is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease with significant negative impact on quality of life and psychological, physical, and social well-being. Typically, acute phases alternate with phases of remission, in which anti-inflammatory therapies used to control disease activity can be reduced. 1, 2, 3 However, 30-50% of patients develop a chronic active disease. 1 The aetiology of the disease is unknown, but relates to a polygenic susceptibility affecting innate and adaptive immune regulation and epithelial cell health, among other factors. 4 Chronic pharmacotherapy of UC targets both asymptomatic as well as symptomatic phases. It focuses on induction of remission by reducing signs and symptoms of disease and promoting mucosal healing. Maintenance therapy is used to prolong remission periods; 5-aminosalicylates [5-ASA, such as mesalamine] represent the most widely used class of drugs for induction and maintenance of remission in mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. Many patients can be maintained on mesalamine monotherapy. Besides its anti-inflammatory mechanism, retrospective correlative studies have suggested that the long-term use of mesalamine in IBD patients may significantly reduce the risk of development of UC-associated colorectal cancer and may prevent sporadic colorectal carcinoma, too. 5, 6 The optimisation of this maintenance strategy would be therefore beneficial to the overall long-term outcome of disease. Non-adherence to chronic medication in IBD is high, with 43% to 60% of patients showing non-adherence. 7, 8, 9 In addition to the direct medication-related costs, non-adherence to mesalamine therapy during remission appears to be an important factor that is associated with relapse in UC. 8, 10, 11 The reasons for non-adherence are largely unknown. The load of tablets and the daily frequency of administration may be parameters that influence adherence. 12 A lack of understanding of the benefits of a chronic medication may contribute to non-adherence behaviour. 13 Patient education can dramatically improve patient knowledge. 14 Recall of medical information that is administered through education was a significant predictor for self-reported medication intake behaviour. 15 The use of a web-based concept for patient education was accompanied by a higher intake rate for mesalamine during acute disease. 16, 17 Patient education may therefore improve adherence. However, access to telemedicine did not improve patients' quality of life or self-reported adherence. 18 Nevertheless, self-reported adherence may not reflect true intake of drugs. We investigated the influence of a structured patient education intervention on mesalamine adherence using an objective readout [ie urine excretion of 5-ASA and metabolites] in a 14-`1month randomised, prospective clinical trial. A secondary aim was the investigation of sociodemographic and clinical parameters associated with non-adherence.Patients and MethodsStudy design We report the results of a multi-centre, open, randomised, interventional, two-armed, controlled, non-blinded trial. The trial has been registered under the German Clinical Trials Register [drks] [www. drks.de] under the acronym 'AdCo' [Adherence Colitis], Clinical Trial number: DRKS00008905; 259 patients were eligible for inclusion. One patient withdrew consent before randomisation; 248 patients were randomised to either receive standard care alone or to receive an additional standardizsd education intervention. For the exact study flow plan, see Figure 1 .Inclusion criteria Minimum age was 18 years and the diagnosis of ulcerative colitis had to be confirmed by colonoscopy and histology, with a minimum duration of disease of 2 years. Individual exceptions by the lead principal investigator could be given to included patients at and above 16 years. At inclusion, disease activity had to reflect remission or mild disease (colitis activity index [CAI] ≤ 9) 19 and the patient had to be on a treatment with mesalamine [irrespectively of any other treatment] or had to be willing to start a treatment with oral mesalamine with a dose of 1.2 to 4.8 g/day [d] upon inclusion. Rectal formulations of mesalamine alone did not qualify for inclusion. Mesalamines prescribed in the study by the outpatient physician comprised the Claversal ® , Mezavant ® , Pentasa ® , and Salofalk ® formulations. It was not requested to prescribe a particular formulation. All patients included in this study were insured in the German health care system. Therefore medication was provided to all patients by the insurance system, without patients having to pay for it. All patients had to give written informed consent and had to be willing and able to follow a standardised education programme.Exclusion criteria Patients with Crohn's disease or indeterminate colitis were excluded, as well as patients with significant comorbidities. Patients with a CAI > 9 were excluded as well as patients with intolerance/contraindication to mesalamine. Also patients after colectomy, as well as patients with a current ostomy, could not participate in the trial.Concomitant medication All concomitant medication was allowed, with no restrictions to the dose.EndpointsPrimary endpoint Primary endpoint was durable adherence to mesalamine treatment, compared between patients undergoing education and the standard care group (intention-to-treat [ITT] population). Adherence was assessed by Morisky Medication Adherence Scale [MMAS] 19 at each visit. It should be pointed out that the MMAS has been previously validated in other chronic diseases, including arterial hypertension, 20 but not IBD; 0-1 points on the MMAS scale are considered as low adherence, 2-3 points as medium adherence, and 4 points [maximum] as highly adherent. The adherence rating was corrected [decreased] in case of missing confirmation of drug exposure in urine samples. Missing or delayed [more than 4 weeks] visits were rated as low adherence. A patient was considered adherent [primary endpoint] if all visits in the follow-up phase were at medium or high adherence or if at most one visit was rated as low adherence. Patients with two or more low adherence visits were considered non-adherent.Secondary endpoints Secondary endpoints included short-term adherence, quality of life, disease activity, and self-assessment of adherence. Secondary endpoints were evaluated in the ITT population. Self-assessment of adherence was measured by the MMAS 21 as described above. To evaluate short term adherence, adherence data at the end of the supervision phase were used. Data of the MMAS-scale were correlated with results of the 5-ASA-measurements in the urine and corrected, if applicable.Evaluation of quality of life Quality of life [Qol] was measured by an Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire [IBDQ-D] comprising 32 questions [validated German translation]. 22 Items on the IBDQ were assessed on a 7-point Likert scale. The IBDQ total score was calculated as total sum of points across all items. The IBDQ subscales [bowel, emotional, systemic, social] were assessed by subscale. Thus, IBDQ score ranges between 32 and 224 points with high values representing good, low values bad, quality of life. The bowel subscale [10 items] ranges between 10 and 70 points. The systemic subscale [5 items] ranges between 5 and 35 points. The emotional subscale [12 items] ranges between 12 and 84 points. The social subscale [5 items] ranges between 5 and 35 points.Evaluation of disease activity Disease activity was measured by a validated index [Colitis Activity Index, CAI] 19 comprising 7 objective as well as subjective criteria. Maximum score is 0-23, remission is defined as a CAI < 4, mild to moderate activity is defined as a CAI of > 4-9, definition of an acute flare is a CAI > 9. 23 Mesalamine, its metabolite, and quality of life [QoL as IBDQ-D sum] were evaluated over time. Data for patients whose measurements were below the lower limit of quantification were imputed by 1.25 and 2.5 for mesalamine and its metabolite, respectively. We applied generalised linear mixed models [GLMM] to cope with nonnormality of the outcomes and the repeated measures during the study. For all outcomes and analysed influencing factors 2.9. Study procedures 2.9.1. Education programme sPatients randomised to the education group received a standardized education programme delivered by either a certified nurse or the trial physician, who used a standardised slide set and underwent training beforehand. This was followed by a group session in which all participants asked questions. A contact for further individual questions [eg by telephone or email] was established, which was used in up to 70% of the patients in both groups without difference. A mandatory training programme ensured standardised delivery of the programme. The education programme, which was administered within 4 weeks after inclusion, comprised slide presentation of at least 2 h and consecutive discussion. The presentation comprised modules summarising aetiology of UC, course of disease, complications, therapy regimen [including the necessity and benefits of mesalamine therapy], and strategies to prevent acute relapses. Patients randomised to the control group were offered participation in the education programme also after termination of the study. The German education slide set is attached as a supplement, available at ECCO-JCC online.Statistical analysisMeasurement of 5-ASA [urine analysis] Measurements of 5-ASA and the metabolite N-acetyl-5-ASA were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography [HPLC], similarly to a previously described method. 25 Urine samples were thawed on the day of analysis. HPLC analysis was performed on an Agilent 1200 system equipped with quaternary pump G1311A, degasser G1322A, autosampler G1329A, and fluorescence detector G1321A. The injection volume was 5 µl. HPLC separation was performed on a Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C18 column [150 × 4.6 mm I.D., 5-µm particle size, Agilent, Waldbronn, Germany] using: [A] a mixture of sodium citrate buffer (0.1 M, pH 3, with EDTA [80 µM], disodium hydrogenphosphate [10 mM], and 1-heptane-sulfonate [4 mM]), and acetonitrile 980:20 [v/v]; and [B] acetonitrile as mobile phases. Gradient runs started with 0% B and a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min until 3 min, then linear increase to 1.2 ml/min to 3.5 min, remaining at 0% B and 1.2 ml/min to 8 min, then increase to 25% B to 10 min, remaining at 25% B and 1.2 ml/min to 13 min, then re-equilibration to 0% B and a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. Calibration samples were prepared by adding varying amounts of 5-ASA and N-acetyl-5-ASA to blank urine [3.125 µg/ml to 200 µg/ml for 5-ASA and 6.25 µg/ml to 400 µg/ml for N-acetyl-5-ASA]. 2.10. Visit schedule 2.10.1. Screening phase A baseline physical examination was conducted and patient demographics were recorded. Patients were also asked to fill in a questionnaire regarding their education level, date of diagnosis, operations, current complaints regarding their disease, and medication intake habits. At day 0 [d0, visit 1] patients were randomised to either the standard care or the education group.Supervision-phase At visits 1 and 2 [d0 and Week 8, respectively], blood was drawn as a standard care procedure and values of haemoglobulin [Hb]  and erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR] were recorded. At both visits patients, were asked to collect urine 24 h before the respective visit and an aliquot of the urine was retained and frozen at -20°C for subsequent determination of 5-ASA. Patients were asked to fill in two questionnaires: the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire [IBDQ] for determination of life quality and the Morisky Medication Adherence scale [MMAS] to determine selfassessment of adherence.Education visit Education was administered during a dedicated study visit between d0 and Week 4. No knowledge test about the disease and its therapy was taken at study entry because of a concern that this could have already an educational input influencing adherence.Follow-up visits and end of the trial [visits 3-6] Follow-up visits were at MonthPatient disposition and study flow In all, 259 patients with inactive or mildly active UC were assessed for eligibility. Of the 258 randomised patients, 248 were included in the ITT collective; 11 patients were excluded from the ITT collective in accordance with the study protocol. There was no particular exclusion of patients receiving biologics. Detailed reasons for withdrawal are given in the CONSORT statement [Figure 1Primary endpoint The primary endpoint of improved durable adherence to mesalamine treatment throughout the study through an education programme was not met. Non-adherence in both groups was similar, with 52.4% patients in the education group in comparison with 52.5% in the standard care group [p = 0.99]. An additional perprotocol analysis was conducted. This analysis [N = 99] also does not show a significant difference between the education group [27.7% non-adherence] and the standard care group [15.4% nonadherence; p = 0.1357].Secondary endpoints All secondary endpoints were not different between the intervention group and standard care. Neither the IBDQ, short-term adherence, nor self-assessment of either adherence or therapy satisfaction at all visits showed any significant differences between groups.Subgroup analyses-anti-TNF Since anti-TNF medication was the only baseline variable that was different between the two study arms, we repeated the primary analysis under consideration of anti-TNF medication. The stratified analysis, using the Cochrane-Mantel-Haenszel test, shows under adjustment for anti-TNF medication that the study arms cannot be considered different with respect to their adherence rates [ITT collective, p = 0.Sociodemographic and disease characteristics and adherence A planned analysis of the influence of sociodemographic and disease characteristics was conducted for the primary endpoint [Identifying factors influencing adherence In the multivariable model, ie adjusting for confounding factors, we could show that older patients have a higher probability of being adherent; females are more likely to be adherent by factor 3. Patients who judge themselves as adherent on the MMAS scale are very likely adherent. Also patients with higher scores on the IBDQ emotional subscale have a higher chance of being adherent. Interestingly, patients with less clinical activity as evidenced by lower disease activity scores and higher IBDQ values are more likely to be adherent. Therefore disease activity could be an important driver for adherence.Modelling adherence We used the multivariate regression analysis to develop a hypothetical score that related to adherence in our study [see Table 2 , Figure 3A and B ]. The receiver operator curve in Figure 3C demonstrates a satisfactory predictive power [AUC = 0.822, 95% CI: 0.765-0.877]. A cut-off value of 0.5 [on the probability scale] shows a modest specificity [48%] and a considerable sensitivity [80%] to predict adherence. The score calculated in this model putatively described the individual risk for each patient to develop non-adherence, but needs to be confirmed by a replication experiment.Urine levels of 5-ASA and its metabolite, sociodemographic factors, and disease characteristics In a post-hoc analysis we related adherence to sociodemographic and disease characteristics [Figures S1-S2 , available at ECCO-JCC online]. Figure S1 demonstrates the relationship with age, which was already detected using aggregated data. This association is seen in the analysis of 5-ASA metabolites, too [Figure S2 ].Internal validation of the score We used a cross-validation approach to assess the model properties.Discussion Non-adherence to prescribed medications is a common problem and can be observed in many chronic diseases. 26, 27 It is one of the most serious problems with regard to direct costs by lost medications and by increasing general health care costs as a result of poor health outcomes, disease-related complications, lost productivity, and compromised quality of life. 28 It has been previously shown that greater belief in treatment necessity positively influences adherence in chronic immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. 29 It can be assumed that the education intervention has improved patient knowledge and insight about the necessity of medical treatment. Written information when reinforced verbally, as it was administered here, is most effective in improving patient knowledge. 30 The education tool used in the trial had been previously developed and optimised by the German Competence Network for IBD in a patient and physician-assisted version. In previous studies, such interventions led to increased patient knowledge and satisfaction. 28, 31 In most studies, selfreported adherence was assessed in a non-controlled design and it was not verified through objective assessments [ie drug exposure testing]. In our study, we could not show a difference in adherence between patients receiving patient education and the control group. All secondary endpoints that allowed for a less stringent definition of adherence also failed to show a difference. The use of urine levels of 5-ASA provides an objective assessment for adherence. The use of this more objective measure could have contributed to the negative outcome of the study which contrasts other studies showing that patient education had a positive effect on self-reported adherence.  In addition, it is impressive to see high non-adherence rates in a situation in which patients know that objective parameters of drug exposure are analysed on an individual level. The high level of non-adherence seen in the study clearly underscores need for measures to improve patient adherence. The under-use of mesalamine may be driving factor of relapse, which is associated with large health care costs. 32 Frequent relapses eventually will promote development of a problematic long-term course of disease 33, 34 with chronic anatomical destruction due to non-controlled inflammation. Whereas mesalamine is a good indicator for overall adherence it is most likely that non-adherence is a problem that is seen across all medications. Medication use statistics [ie prescription renewal] indicate that use of these drugs also suffers from a significant non-adherence rate. 35 With the trend to more effective [and more expensive] oral and subcutaneous therapies for IBD, non-adherence is a large problem that conflicts with the desired positive impact on outcome in IBD. Adherence to therapy with mesalamine was used as a marker in our study to characterise patient behaviour. Theoretically, patients may not have taken their mesalamine because they were not convinced about its [low level] of efficacy in comparison with other, more powerful options. We think this is unlikely, because no difference in adherence was seen between patients who had been advanced to anti-TNF therapy and those receiving oral drugs only. It is likely that non-adherence is a problem for self-administered study drugs in clinical trials, too, and may therefore affect the differentiation between active drug and placebo when new medications are developed. Absolute rates of non-adherence were high in our patient population. It is possible that the selection of patients [ie many patients already receiving stepped-up care beyond 5-ASA] has contributed to this. The drugs given in addition to mesalamine [ie further tablets and/or injections/infusions] add to the burden of medication, which could decrease adherence in general. In most cases, there were additional elements of active therapy prescribed for the remaining disease symptoms. However, it is unlikely that patients did specifically decide against taking their mesalamine because aminosalicylates were not just given as a baseline medication for inflammation but also to protect against cancer. Conversely, one could discuss whether a more 'simple' patient population [ie from primary care centres] could not have shown even higher non-adherence rates, because the disease burden and hence the motivation in such a population could be smaller. Future studies should therefore stratify patients by therapeutic intensity and create large enough subgroups including disease burden. Non-adherence is a multi-layer problem and therefore needs to be combated using every possible intervention. Educational interventions alone seem to be not sufficient. Several trials have shown that instruction of patients in self-management strategies is able to increase adherence 36 as well as constant checks of the current therapy and efforts to simplify dosage. 37, 38 Although we hoped that a one-time patient education programme would promote adherence throughout the entire observation period, one could argue that an ongoing or a shorter intervention would lead to a more sustained impact. To optimise knowledge transfer, in future trials patient education should be tested. The assessment of 5-ASA and its metabolites is a strong tool to detect even temporary changes in adherence. It is disappointing to not even see a trace of the intervention within the first few weeks of results. Therefore combined interventions may be more effective. Ideally, one should examine a continuous, intensified subgroup analyses intervention strategy, with patient education that after administration in a group is repeated individually, employs internet resources, and feeds personal exposure/adherence data back to the patients. This is a remarkable observation, because it would be anticipated that at higher need for therapy and a higher burden of acute disease should lead to higher adherence rate. In future studies of patient adherence, it should be examined whether this observation is reproducible and whether it is specific to patients with an inflammatory bowel disease. It could be that patients with IBD initially neglect their disease, and therefore short disease duration is associated with an unwillingness to commit to [lifelong] chronic medication. Further to this, high clinical activity [which is demonstrated by low IBDQ values] could be accompanied by general problems of the digestive tract [eg nausea]. This could be another factor leading to non-adherence to oral medication. In earlier studies adherence was very low, too, and self-reported adherence was affected by multiple daily dosings and full-time employment. 39 We have generated a post-hoc model that marks a patient population that should receive particular attention in both clinical practice and clinical trials. Our hypothetical score in this model, which needs to be prospectively evaluated, could help to better define such problem patients and recruit them to intervention studies. It is therefore important to replicate our findings and to derive a practical definition of the patient population at particular risk for non-adherence. If replicated, itFigure 1 . 2 . 8 . 1 . 1281 Figure 1. Study flow chart.5 [V3], Month 8 [V4], Month 11 [V5], and Month 14 [V6]. At each of the visits, values of Hb and ESR were recorded. CAI, IBDQ, and MMAS were determined and a urine sample was collected and frozen for further determination.7038; per protocol (PP) collective, p = 0.5411]. The subgroup analyses also show the same rates of non-adherence (anti-TNF group: ITT [N = 44], p = 0.7385; PP [N = 15], p = 0.5692; non anti-TNF group: ITT [N = 201], p = 0.8879; PP [N = 83], p = 0.7684) All p-values in the subgroup analysis were by Fisher's exact test. Also, the number of different medications taken did not influence adherence.Figure 2]. Patients of young age were particularly non-adherent [18-40 years: 70%; 63/90 vs 40-60 years: 47%; 54/115 and > 60 years: 30.2%; 13/43] [Figure 2, panel B]. High levels of non-adherence were associated with a short duration of disease [time since diagnosis] [2-5 years: 55.9%; 57/102 vs 5-10 years: 52.2%; 35/67, 10-15 years: 51.2%; 21/41 and > 15 years: 44.7%; 17/38 [Figure 2, panel D]. A trend for a relationship between non-adherence and low education levels was seen [(ow education [only basic school]: 63.8%, 30/47 in comparison with higher education levels [trade school]: 41.8%, 28/67 and 'Abitur'/university: 58%, 65/112).First we fitted the final model [including the variable selection step]. Then 5000 random samples of size 190/248 [77%] were drawn from the study data set. The model fit for the final model was recalculated and the resulting model applied to the 58 dropped patients in each cross-validation repetition. The differences in model prediction [predicted probability for adherence] were analysed [Figures S3, S4, available at ECCO-JCC online]. The resulting root mean squared error [RMSE] is 0.035. The resulting mean absolute error [MAE] is 0.026.Figure 2 . 2 Figure 2. Adherence in selected subgroups.

Patient population and educational status Median age was 44.6 years in the standard care group [18.41-81.02 years] vs 46.7 years in the education group [19.61-88.09 years]. In the standard care group, 66 male patients were included vs 68 in the education group. Education status was classified according the German school system as Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/ecco-jcc/article/11/9/1052/3806708 by TU Wien Bibliothek user on 02 June 2023 'without graduation', 'baseline certificate of secondary education' ['Hauptschulabschluss'], ' higher certificate of secondary education' ['Realschulabschluss'], 'advanced technical university entrance qualification' ['Fachabitur'], 'university entrance qualification' ['Abitur'], and 'studies at a university' ['Fachhochschulabschluss']. A foreign education that could not be classified in the scheme was reported by one patient in the standard care and one patient in the education group [Table 1]. ]. Randomised patients received either the standard care [N = 122] or standard care with an additional intervention with a standardised patient education programme [N = 126]. 2.2.11.2.

It remains unclear what the best measures are to counteract non-adherence, but it is likely that future tools will involve technical personnel assisting physicians in patient care. Measures should not only include an intensified education but also comprise consultations in health care that centre the interaction with patients around their objective individual exposure data.

These patients need disease-related information and education. However, it remains unclear how this information should be provided in order to decrease their worries and concerns, and improve their healthrelated quality of life. Disease activity is one of the most important factors for reduced health-related quality of life. Therefore it is also important to assess more information about trigger factors for relapses in inflammatory bowel disease. Aim: The general aim of this thesis was to gain scientific evidence about worries and concerns, health-related quality of life, and trigger factors for relapses, and to develop and evaluate an education programme. Method: In all four studies the patients included were diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease, and in remission. In Study I, 93 patients were included and randomized to an intervention group or a control group. The intervention group attended a groupbased education programme. Health-related quality of life was measured at baseline and after six months, by using four questionnaires. The intervention group also completed the questionnaires after one month. In Study II, 197 patients were included and divided into a Crohn's disease group and an ulcerative colitis group. Each group was also divided into separate groups according to whether the patients had short disease duration or long disease duration. Health-related quality of life was measured using four questionnaires. In Study III, a sample of 195 patients was included. They filled in the RFIPC, and two other questionnaires measuring health-related quality of life. Confirmatory factor analysis was performed to validate the factor structure in the Swedish version of the RFIPC and to examine fit of different hypothesized models of factor structure. In Study IV, 60 patients were included. They filled in a structured diary daily during six months in order to collect information about symptoms and potential trigger factors, such as perceived stress. Results: No difference could be found in health-related quality of life between patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Scores of health-related quality of life were lower for patients with short disease duration than for patients with long disease duration. Patients with Crohn's disease and short disease duration had the lowest health-related quality of life. After attending an education programme, an improvement was found in the intervention group when measurements were made after one month. After six months, no improvement could be shown in health-related quality of life when comparing the intervention group with the control group. The RFIPC is the most appropriate choice when measuring health-related quality of life, worries and concerns. Using the single-factor model (sum score) displayed poor fit indices. The factorial structure of the RFIPC, as suggested in the original version, could be replicated with a slight modification in the Swedish version and showed the most adequate fit. Perceived stress can act as a trigger for relapses in inflammatory bowel diseases. A high level of perceived stress was found to have an effect when stratifying level of stress. High level of stress one day increased the risk of relapse the next day. Conclusion: CD patients with short disease duration have the greatest need of education and support. No improvement could be seen in health-related quality of life after attending an education programme. The separate factors in RFIPC provide more detailed information about patients' disease-related worries and concerns in both research and clinical settings. This may help healthcare professionals to provide each patient with the appropriate education and support. Identification of trigger factors for relapses in inflammatory bowel disease also makes it possible to influence the trigger. By extension, this could decrease the number of relapses and improve health-related quality of life.","LIST OF ABBREVIATIONSINTRODUCTION Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have to cope with a lifelong condition and make many lifestyle adjustments. Living with IBD and its unpredictable course may influence several aspects of life. Worries and concerns related to IBD may affect the patient's adjustment to the illness and compliance with treatment [1, 2] . Patients with IBD rate their health-related quality of life (HRQOL) lower than a general population [3] [4] [5] [6] , and disease activity is one of the most important factors for decreased HRQOL [3, [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Therefore, patients with IBD need both treatment for the bowel symptoms as well as disease-related information, particularly concerning factors that may trigger relapses (especially if the trigger can be influenced). By extension, this might lead to fewer relapses, a decrease in patients' worries and concerns, and also to improvements in HRQOL. I became interested in patients with IBD because of their complex life situation. It is not only the disease that needs to be treated; several aspects of life also have to be considered. All patients with chronic diseases require information and education to help them have a better life in spite of their illness. It is important to support these patients in their efforts to cope with the disease, and provide them with as much disease-related knowledge as possible. Living with IBD may affect several aspects of life and patients have to deal with different lifestyle adjustments. Many questions may arise when dealing with for example pregnancies, travelling, symptoms, financial issues and different treatments. Availability at the clinic is very important [10] . Patients with IBD are often in the middle of life and may find it difficult to keep to fixed telephone hours due to their own working-or school hours. In our clinic we changed our way of working with IBD patients in 2003, when a clinic especially for IBD patients and managed by nurses was started. Availability is one of the most important aspects of the clinic. The telephone line is open during the whole day, with an answering machine that takes calls when it is not possible to answer. It is the nurses who are in charge of patients' annual visits. Before the IBD clinic was started it was the gastroenterologists who took care of these visits, but they could not prioritize the annual visits since they had to take care of acute visits and new patients. The nurses also provide patients with more structured information, especially those who are newly diagnosed but also those who need further knowledge. Today our IBD patients receive both group-based as well as individual information, and the aim is to be as available as possible. There is still much to learn about IBD. We can learn more from other specialities that work with chronic diseases, for example in the area of diabetes, but we also learn a great deal by studying our IBD patients. What are their needs and how can we help them to improve the way they live and cope with their disease? This thesis tries to clarify a number of questions, and by extension this may help nurses and doctors to provide better help for IBD patients.BACKGROUNDINFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE -IBD IBD includes ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), comprising chronic diseases that are characterized by alternating periods of remission and relapses [11, 12] . The most common symptoms of UC are diarrhoea, rectal bleeding, and abdominal pain [13, 14] . The inflammation is non-transmural and restricted to the colon. The extent of the inflammation may vary: proctitis, left-sided colitis (involving the sigmoid colon with or without involvement of the descending colon), or fulminant colitis [13] . In CD the inflammation is transmural and may affect the entire gastrointestinal tract, from the mouth to the anus [13, 15] . The inflammation is often discontinuous (in contrast to UC, where the inflammation is always continuous) and complications including strictures, abscesses, or fistulas may occur. At diagnosis the disease is located in the terminal ileum in 47% of cases, in the colon for 28%, the ileocolon for 21%, and in the upper gastrointestinal tract for 3%. The symptoms depend on disease location and may include diarrhoea, abdominal pain, fever, clinical signs of bowel obstruction, passage of blood or mucos or both [13] . CD and UC are most commonly diagnosed in late adolescence and early adulthood but may occur in all ages [16] . Endoscopy with biopsy sampling is the gold standard for diagnosing IBD, but blood-and stool samples are also necessary [14] . Current IBD medications include corticosteroids, 5-aminosalicylates (5-ASA), immunomodulators, biologic agents, and antibiotics [13, 14] . Despite improvements in medical treatment, surgery still plays an important role. Indications for surgery include bowel perforation, intractable disease despite medical treatment, dysplasia, strictures, and fistulas [14] . Patients with IBD have an increased risk of colorectal carcinoma when they have had the disease for a long time. Risk factors for colorectal carcinoma are long-term disease (more than 8-10 years), young age of onset, extensive colonic involvement, family history of colorectal carcinoma, and concomitant inflammatory manifestations, for example primary sclerosing cholangitis [17] . The risk is the same in both CD and UC. Colonoscopies for screening should begin 8-10 years after the onset of IBD symptoms in patients with fulminant UC and patients with CD involving at least one third of the colon [17] [18] [19] . How often the surveillance colonoscopies should be repeated depends on the presence of dysplasia. According to guidelines, the survey should be done every 1-2 years [17] .Relapses The course of UC is characterized by relapses that alternate with periods of remission, but for a minority of patients there is a more continuous course. Both the severity of the relapses as well as patient response to treatment vary and are difficult to predict [15] . For CD patients the course is generally also characterized by alternating periods of relapses with remission of varying durations. However, 10-15% of these patients have a more chronic, continuous course [15] . Both CD and UC seem to become less severe over time. A decrease in symptoms is the most common course of the diseases [12, 20, 21] . Five years after diagnosis, the majority of UC patients have no symptoms and 40% do not take any medication for IBD [20] . Direct costs are highest in the first year after diagnosis and greater in CD patients compared with UC patients [21] . A more benign course can be seen in both CD patients and UC patients with increasing disease duration [12, 21, 22] , but even patients with long periods in remission may experience a severe relapse or complication that requires surgery.Aetiology The aetiology of IBD is still unknown but it is likely that genetic predisposition, environmental factors, and immune dysfunction are all important [23] . The association between smoking and IBD is well established. Smokers are at higher risk of developing CD than non-smokers, whereas ex-smokers run an increased risk of developing UC [15, [24] [25] [26] [27] . It has also been suggested that there may be a specific effect of antibiotics in early life which may increase the risk of developing IBD, particularly CD, later on [24] , and possible infectious events may also influence the risk of IBD [27] . A family history of IBD is an important risk factor for developing the disease. On average, 8-10% of CD patients and 6% of UC patients have one or more relatives with IBD [25] .Incidence and Prevalence The highest incidence rates have been reported in northern and western Europe and North America [15, 28] . Previous low-incidence areas of eastern Europe, Asia, North Africa, and Central and South America have demonstrated a recent increase in the incidence and prevalence of IBD [15, 28] . In paediatric IBD, significant increases in both incidence and prevalence can be seen [14] . Over the past 50 years the incidence of UC has increased and then stabilized, or even decreased, whereas the incidence of CD has continually increased [15] . In the United States and Canada there are approximately 780 000 persons with UC, and 630 000 persons with CD. In Europe, there are approximately 2.2 million persons suffering from IBD [16] .TRIGGER FACTORS OF RELAPSES It is still unknown whether any factors/variables can be triggers of disease relapses. However, diet, smoking, infections, antibiotics, and stress have all been reported to be potential triggers of relapses in IBD.Lifestyle Factors It has been suggested that specific diet could impact the course of the disease. It is possible that an intake of high-fibre, rice-based, and high-fish diets could work as a protection against relapse. On the other hand, diets including large amounts of red meat, simple sugar, and low fibre could be trigger factors [29] . Studies have shown that the course of the disease cannot be influenced by avoiding certain foodstuffs, or by adopting a specific diet. Nevertheless, there is evidence that some diet therapy is effective in treating the diseases [30, 31] . Some studies have found that a diet with low doses of refined carbohydrate is beneficial for patients, while other studies have been unable to confirm this [30] . Research has shown that an increase in intake of animal protein and an increase in intake of omega 6 fatty acid compared with omega 3 fatty acid correlated with a high risk of IBD [29] . Patients with UC who smoke are more likely to have a relapse if they quit smoking [32] , and patients with CD are more likely to be smokers [33] . The properties of cigarette smoking that lead to a negative development in CD and protect against disease activity in UC are, however, still unknown.Infection and Antibiotics It is suggested that there is a link between systemic or respiratory infection and relapse in IBD, but the evidence for this is minimal. It is possible that these infections lead to relapses in IBD patients, but it may be that IBD-affected tissues allow for increased cell membrane permeability, therefore implying greater potential for pathogenic infection [34] . It has also been suggested that enteric infections, for example clostridium difficile, cause relapse in IBD, but it is possible that they cause symptoms of their own, rather than inducing a relapse [34] . It remains unclear whether the use of antibiotics directly triggers a relapse in IBD, and there is as yet no evidence that this should be classified as a trigger. The hypothesis is that antibiotics can change beneficial microbial flora, which can be injurious in IBD [34] .Stress It has been suggested that high stress is associated with relapse in IBD [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] . Stress is a condition in which person-environment interactions lead to a perceived discrepancy between the demands of the situation and the biological, psychological and social resources of the person. Stress has been defined as a process in which environmental demands tax or exceed the adaptive capacity of an organism, resulting in psychological and biological changes that may place persons at risk for disease [40] . Stress can be looked at from different perspectives: environmental stress, which includes life events; psychological stress, focusing on individuals' perceived stress; and finally biological stress, which focuses on the activation of physiological systems [40] . Some studies have examined the possible association between stress and relapses in IBD, and there is some evidence that perceived stress is a trigger [34-37, 39, 41] . However, there are studies where no connection could be found [42] [43] [44] , and other studies showing that short-term stress does not trigger relapses but long-term stress increases the risk [38] . Others have found an association between stress and relapse in UC but not in CD [41] . On the other hand, depressive symptoms seem to have a negative effect on the course of CD [45] . Studies have been made to investigate the effect of stress reduction programmes. Stress management psychotherapy does not improve disease activity but improves HRQOL, especially in UC patients [46] . So far, the stress reduction programmes that have been developed have had little effect on CD patients [45, 46] . Acute psychological stress has several proinflammatory effects at both systemic and mucosal levels. For example, stress increases the production of ROM (reactive oxygen metabolite), which may contribute to mucosal damage. Stress has also been shown to reduce the RMBF (rectal mucosal blood flow), causing mucosal ischaemia which may trigger relapses. Increases in both platelet activation and PLA formation (plateletleucocyte aggregate) might also be partly responsible for stress-induced symptoms in IBD [39] . There are several issues involved in studying the link between stress and relapse in IBD. There are, for example, several ways to measure stress. Some studies utilize reports of stressful life events. Others use stress diaries or standardized questionnaires, while there are also studies that focus on physiological correlates/indices of stress. The physiological response to stressful experiences can be studied by measuring urinary metabolites of catecholamines or cortisol, making serial measurements of serum or salivary cortisol, or by monitoring cardiovascular or immune responses to stress [45] . Since a relapse in IBD is a stressful event in itself it may be difficult in cross-sectional data to establish whether stress is the cause or the consequence of the relapse.HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQOL) Quality of life has been defined as individuals' perceptions of their position in life in the context of the culture and value systems in which they live and in relation to their goals, expectations, standards and concerns [47] . HRQOL is the value assigned to duration of life as modified by the impairments, functional states, perceptions and social opportunities that are influenced by disease, injury, treatment or policy [48] . HRQOL is determined by the patient's physical, psychological and social status, and by attitudes, concerns and behaviours in response to the disease [2] . IBD is a disease which has a major impact on patients' lives. Several studies have examined HRQOL in patients with IBD, and it is clear that their HRQOL is impaired compared with that of a healthy population [6, [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] . Symptom severity is one of the most important associations with reduced HRQOL [4-7, 49, 53, 56-60] . In some studies it can be demonstrated that CD patients have lower HRQOL compared with UC patients [2, 3, 8, 51, 52, 61] , but in other studies no differences have been found [6, 54, 62, 63] . Women are another subgroup for whom HRQOL seems to be reduced [1, 3-5, 49, 54, 61-64] . So far, few studies have examined the association between HRQOL and disease duration. Those that have been conducted have displayed various results. Two studies have shown that longer disease duration is associated with better HRQOL [5, 65] , whereas one study did not find any difference between short and long disease duration [9] . CD patients in remission, who have low disease activity and no need for medical treatment to maintain remission, have 3.5 times lower costs (both direct medical costs and costs for lost productivity) than patients with a more active disease. Also, patients that respond to treatment have lower costs and better HRQOL compared with patients where disease activity is high but no treatment is given or there is no response to treatment [66] . There seems to be a complex relationship between biopsychosocial factors and HRQOL. Different aspects of well-being interact with various biopsychosocial factors in determining the IBD patient's well-being [67] . Psychological factors, such as depressive mood associated with anxiety and poor HRQOL, seem to have a negative influence on the course of IBD [68] .WORRIES AND CONCERNS Everyone worries from time to time, even those who do not suffer from a chronic disease. Worry involves a predominance of negative verbal thoughts. We talk to ourselves about negative things and what may happen in the future [69] . The highest rated reasons for worrying are that it helps to discover ways of avoiding negative future events and it prepares us for the worst scenario if this cannot be avoided [70] . Most people with a chronic disease have many worries and concerns. Even if they do not have any symptoms they may feel worried since they do not know how they are going to feel tomorrow. High levels of worry are associated with increased threat and negative content in cognitive representations of illness [71] . Worry predicts anxious and depressive symptoms and correlates positively with a disengagement of coping efforts, and negatively with perceived coping effectiveness [72] . Among the many worries and concerns of IBD patients in relation to the disease, the most important are related to surgery, energy level, having an ostomy bag, the uncertain nature of the disease, the effects of medication, being a burden on others, loss of bowel control, developing cancer, the ability to achieve full potential, pain or suffering [1, 2, 63, 64, 73] . The illness may lead to several consequences in the person's life affecting work, education, family life, sexual life and social relationships. Making adjustments becomes part of everyday life. The patient's worries and concerns may also decrease HRQOL and affect the clinical outcome. Some young people with CD describe life as a roller coaster of fears and hopes, the known and the unknown. They experience extreme exhaustion, debilitating surgery, and near-death experiences as they seesaw between wellness and illness, and hope for a better future [74] . Many patients with IBD spend considerable time thinking and worrying, and planning around the disease [75] . Some patients have described that even in remission they find it difficult to feel secure because the habit of being ill is so strong. It can take them several months of remission before they feel confident enough to participate in different activities [10] .DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY There is a higher rate of depression and anxiety in IBD patients than in the general population [76] . There also seem to be more severe depressive and anxiety symptoms when the IBD is active [8, 76] . Patients with CD have more anxiety and depression compared with UC patients [8, 53] . Patients with IBD may have great psychosocial restrictions due to their disease and express a greater need for psychological interventions than patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The psychological factors are mainly worries about the impact of the disease and anxiety [77] .COPING People with chronic diseases may have major limitations in physical, emotional, social and occupational functioning. It has been shown that psychological factors, in particular cognitive representations, coping efforts, and appraisals of coping efforts, play a crucial role in adaptation to a chronic disease. Coping behaviours are influenced by the person's representation of the illness and appraisals of coping efforts. Coping efforts aim to avoid or reduce the negative consequences of the illness [78] . Coping has been defined as constantly changing cognitive and behavioural efforts to manage specific external and/or internal demands that are appraised as taxing or exceeding the resources of a person [79] . The threat of illness may produce an emotional response. This emotion might increase or decrease the intensity of illness symptoms and generate symptoms that could be confused with those of the illness. This could lead a person to concentrate on the most negative consequences of the illness [80] . Coping is a process that changes over time and across situations. During the process of coping, the situation itself or the person's feelings about it change; this requires new appraisals, which in turn leads to new coping strategies [79] In patients with IBD, the most frequently used coping strategies are characterized by optimism, self-reliance, confrontation, acceptance, and seeking emotional support [8, 81] . IBD patients often wished that the problem would go away, tried to keep the situation under control, or hoped that things would get better [8, 82] . Many patients also tried to think positively and tried to keep their feelings under control [8] . Less effective coping strategies such as substance use, expressing anger, self-distraction and self-blame are associated with higher disability, psychological distress and poorer physical and mental health [81] . Depressive coping is characterized by social withdrawal, irritable behaviour towards others, self-pity, and pessimistic thinking. Depressive coping is dysfunctional with regard to emotional and physical well-being and is strongly and negatively associated with reduced HRQOL [60, 63] .COMPLIANCE AND ADHERENCE Non-adherence and non-compliance is common in IBD and may result in more relapses. Those who are most non-adherent are young patients, when they are in remission and taking maintenance therapies for IBD [83] . This may result in an overuse of health resources with a shift from cost-effective preventive care to more emergency treatment of relapses. It may also lead to financial loss due to the patients' inability to work, or that family members have to take time off work to take care of patients [84] . Shared decision-making between patients and physicians appears to be more powerful when it comes to encouraging the patient regarding adherence and compliance [83] [84] [85] . Patient education is another way to deal with this [83, 84] .INFORMATION AND EDUCATION Perceived level of IBD information correlates with patients' concerns. Lower scores for the level of information are associated with more concerns [73] . Patient education can lead to more effective coping strategies, less anxiety and depression, and reduced IBD symptoms [86] . IBD patients call for information about their disease and how to manage it, but they want more than they are given [87, 88] . How should IBD patients be educated about their disease? Among the different ways that have been tested, group-based education programmes have been very much appreciated by patients, and knowledge scores have been improved. These programmes include between four and nine sessions, of around two to three hours per session, covering various topics, which are most often presented by gastroenterologists, dieticians, surgeons, psychologists, social workers, and nurses. The groups contain about 8-12 patients and in some education programmes family members are welcome [86, [89] [90] [91] . It is important to give disease-related information to newly diagnosed patients. These patients often need several clinical visits at the beginning of their disease to ensure that all important issues are covered [84, 92] . Self-management is a way to teach patients with a chronic disease to be more involved in their own care. This has been tested in the form of a patient guidebook, which contains information about investigation and treatment. It also contains selfmanagement of IBD and indicated areas where patient choice might influence treatment decisions. Guided self-management is a written plan to which patients can refer when making decisions about treatment and the need for service contact [93] . They need to work in partnership with their doctors, and this can be achieved by using patientcentred consultants. The gastroenterologists or specialist nurses should however be trained in patient-centred communication for the self-management to be as effective as possible [94] . Many patients with IBD are young and eager to learn more about their disease. A considerable amount of medical information is readily accessible on the Internet and it is quite common that newly diagnosed IBD patients are already well informed on their first visit to the clinic. Gastroenterologists and specialist nurses need to learn more about the information that is available on the Internet in order to help the patients find and use appropriate websites [84] . Knowledge about the disease and how to manage it is essential for patients with a chronic disease such as IBD. This may have a positive influence on HRQOL and the capacity to handle treatment.RATIONALE The incidence of IBD has increased. Due to the increasing number of patients and the fact that the number of healthcare professionals is not increasing, it is becoming essential to learn more about HRQOL. Which patients have the greatest need for education and support? It has been shown in the literature that patients with IBD have poor HRQOL compared with a healthy population. They also have a number of worries and concerns. IBD patients need and call for disease-related information, but there are still some questions remaining about how this information should be provided in order to increase HRQOL. It is also important to gain more knowledge about the issues that are most burdensome for IBD patients. This helps to individualize patient education and support. Healthcare professionals can then focus on these topics, with the aim of reducing patients' IBD symptoms and stress, and promoting effective coping strategies. In the long run this could lead to fewer worries, improved HRQOL, and fewer relapses. Several studies have shown that disease activity is the most important factor for reduced HRQOL. It is therefore fundamental to gain more information about what may trigger relapses in IBD, especially if the trigger can be influenced. In this way patients can be better informed and better supported in this area, which could lead to fewer relapses and increased HRQOL. It is extremely important to have a deeper insight into HRQOL and the worries and concerns of IBD patients, in order to better understand them. In this way we can develop more effective nursing intervention programmes, providing the best possible education and support. It is essential to have the right measurements in order to identify which patients have the greatest need of education and support, and to identify which issues patients are most worried about. For further studies in this area it is also important to find a good tool for measuring trigger factors for relapses. All this may influence the clinical course for the patients.AIMS OF THE THESISGENERAL AIM The general aim of this thesis was to gain scientific evidence about worries and concerns, HRQOL, and trigger factors for relapses, and to develop and evaluate an education programme.SPECIFIC AIMS The specific aims for each study were: • To create an education programme which would be suitable for patients with newly diagnosed IBD and which could be readily applied at the clinic, and to investigate whether a group-based education programme could improve HRQOL among patients with IBD (Study I). • To identify predictors of low HRQOL among patients with IBD and make a comparison between CD and UC with respect to disease duration (Study II). • To validate the factor structure in the Swedish version of the RFIPC and to explore how these hypothesized different factors are associated with HRQOL and general health (Study III). • To examine whether perceived stress has a short-term acute effect, i.e. whether it acts as a trigger, for the risk of relapse in IBD (Study IV).METHODSINSTRUMENTS A combination of generic and disease-specific questionnaires was used in Studies I and II, to describe and measure HRQOL and worries and concerns in patients with IBD. In Study III, the same combination was used but in order to validate one of the diseasespecific questionnaires. In Study IV, a structured diary was used.The Health Index The Health Index (HI), used in Studies I, II, and III, is a generic questionnaire. It contains nine questions describing the patient's general health [95] , and includes questions regarding energy, temper, fatigue, loneliness, sleep, vertigo, bowel function, pain and mobility. Each question is graded: 1=very poor, 2=rather poor, 3=rather good, 4=very good. The total score ranges from 9 (very poor general health) to 36 (very good general health). The internal consistency reliability measured with Cronbach's alpha coefficient reached acceptable levels in all studies using the HI.The Sense of Coherence Scale The short form of the Sense of Coherence (SOC) questionnaire, used in Studies I and II, is a generic instrument that measures coping capacity [96] . The concept of SOC includes three components: the perception of comprehensibility, manageability, and meaningfulness. The questionnaire contains 13 questions, each with a scale graded from 1 to 7. Possible scores range from 13 to 91. A high score indicates a strong sense of coherence. With a strong sense of coherence, it is more likely that a person will cope successfully with stressful situations. The rationale for using this questionnaire is based on an increased interest in the phenomenon of coping related to stress, and the way in which this is related to illness and health. The SOC questionnaire has been shown to have adequate reliability and validity in Sweden [97, 98] . The internal consistency reliability measured with Cronbach's alpha coefficient reached acceptable levels in all studies using the SOC.The Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire The Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ), used in Studies I, II, and III, is a disease-specific questionnaire used for assessing HRQOL in patients with IBD. It has 32 items, divided into four subscales: bowel symptoms (bowel movements and abdominal pain), systemic symptoms (fatigue and sleep), emotional function (irritation, depression and aggression), and social function (ability to work and participate in social activities). The IBDQ has been shown to be a reliable and sensitive measure of HRQOL [99, 100] and it has been validated in Sweden [101, 102] . In Studies I, II, and III, we used the response option that is used in the UK version of the IBDQ, since it is more differentiated [103] . In this version, a 4-graded Lickert scale is used instead of the 7-graded Lickert scale that was developed by Guyatt et al. [99] . Score 1 represents the ""best function"" and score 4 represents the ""worst function"". We used all 32 items [99] and the total score ranges from 32 (optimal HRQOL) to 128 (worst HRQOL). The modified version of the IBDQ was tested for reliability and validity in Study I by using Cronbach's alpha coefficient and Rasch analysis [104] . The internal consistency reliability measured with Cronbach's alpha coefficient reached acceptable levels in all studies using the IBDQ.The Rating Form of Inflammatory Bowel Disease PatientConcerns The Rating Form of Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patient Concerns (RFIPC), used in Studies I, II, and III, is a disease-specific questionnaire that rates important worries and concerns of patients with IBD. The RFIPC contains 25 items or concerns that are graded on 100 mm visual analogue scales, where the extremes are 0 mm=""not at all"", and 100 mm=""a great deal"". The basic formulation is ""Because of your condition, how concerned are you about…?"" The items or concerns are for example ""having surgery"", ""feeling alone"", ""uncertain nature of the disease"", ""effects on medication"", ""being a burden on others"", ""loss of sexual drive"". It has been shown that the RFIPC is a reliable and sensitive measure of the worries and concerns expressed by patients with IBD, for use in clinical care and in research [1] . In the original version of the RFIPC, the 25 items are divided into four factors: impact of the disease, sexual intimacy, complications of the disease and body stigma. In Sweden it is mostly the sum score (the mean of the 25 items) that is reported in the studies using the questionnaire. In Studies I and II, we reported the results of the RFIPC by displaying the sum score. In Study III, we validated the factor structure. The internal consistency reliability measured with Cronbach's alpha coefficient reached acceptable levels in all studies using the RFIPC.Evaluation of the Education Programme The patients in the intervention group in Study I filled in a questionnaire for evaluation of the group-based education programme. The patients were asked about the point of time for the sessions, how the group was composed and how satisfied they were with the education programme. Response alternatives were graded from 1 to 7, where 1 was the worst score and 7 the best possible score. The patients were also asked about their general opinion of the education programme.The Diary To collect information regarding symptoms of IBD and a number of potential triggers, a diary was constructed for Study IV. The potential triggers included were based on previous literature reported on possible triggers for relapse [34, 105] . Questions in the diary were used to identify relapses and concerned number of loose stools during daytime and night-time, occurrence of urgency, blood in stools, and abdominal pain, with a scale graded from 0 to 4 (0 = no problem to 4 = all the time). One question concerned the patients' general well-being, with a response scale graded from 0 to 4 (0 = very good to 4 = very bad). Perceived stress was measured with the question ""Have you felt stressed today?"" and a five-graded response scale ranging from 0 to 4 (0 = not at all to 4 = a lot). Another question concerned changes in food intake regarding sugar, fat, and fibre graded on a three-point scale. A further question dealt with smoking; 0 = no (non-smoker) and 1 = yes (smoker), and if ""yes"" the patients had to state the number of cigarettes per day. The non-smokers were asked if they had stopped smoking and if so, when. The last question dealt with having an infection, for example a cold or an enteric infection, and whether they had taken antibiotics, with two response alternatives, 0 = no and 1 = yes. In the diary it was also possible for patients to state if their medical treatment had been changed, and to give information about additional trigger factors such as divergences from their normal life situations. Patients were instructed to fill in the diary every day during 26 weeks.The Truelove and Witts Index The Truelove and Witts Index is commonly used to assess disease severity. The severity of the illness is assessed according to severe, moderate, and mild. Severe disease is when the patient has diarrhoea six or more times a day with macroscopic blood in the stools, fever, tachycardia, and anaemia. Mild disease is when the patient has mild diarrhoea (maximum four times per day) with no more than a small amount of macroscopic blood in the stools, no fever, no tachycardia, and no severe anaemia. Moderate disease is between severe and mild [106] . In Study IV, the Truelove and Witts Index was used to identify relapses.The Harvey-Bradshaw Index The Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI) was developed to assess the degree of illness in patients with CD. The criteria included are: number of liquid or soft stools per day, abdominal pain rating (0-3), general well-being rating (0-4), presence of abdominal mass (0=none, 1=dubious, 2=definite, 3=definite and tender), complications: arthralgia, uveitis, erythema nodosum, pyoderma gangrenosum, anal fissure, new fistula, abscess (score 1 per item). An HBI score of less than five is defined as being in remission, 5 to 7 as mildly active disease, 8 to 16 as moderately active disease, and >16 as severely active disease [107, 108] . The HBI was used in Studies II, III, and IV to assess whether the patients were in remission before inclusion.The Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity Index The Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity Index (UC-DAI) is used to measure degree of illness in UC. The UC-DAI is the sum of scores from four criteria: stool frequency, rectal bleeding, mucosal appearance, investigator's rating of disease activity. Each of the criteria can be ranked from 0-3. UC in remission is defined as two or fewer points. Severe disease is defined as greater than nine points [109] . The UC-DAI was used in Studies II, III, and IV to determine if patients were in remission before they were included.PARTICIPANTS AND PROCEDURE In Studies I, II, and III, missing values are accounted for by using the mean substitution procedure. The missing values for a variable are replaced by a mean value of that variable, calculated from all valid responses [110] .Study I Figure1. Overview of participants and dropouts in Study IParticipants Patients suffering from CD or UC for less than two years, who were in clinical remission and visited the IBD clinic at Danderyd Hospital between November 2002 and November 2004, were invited to participate in the study. To be included, they were to suffer from no other chronic diseases, have a good understanding of the Swedish language and be able to fill in a questionnaire. Clinical remission was defined as having no bowel symptoms associated with active disease, i.e. no diarrhoea or blood in the stools, and undergoing no acute treatment. A total of 116 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were invited to participate in the study. Ninety-nine patients (85%) gave their informed consent. Fifty-five patients were randomized to the intervention group and 44 patients were randomized to the control group. Six patients in the control group dropped out when they were informed that they had not been randomized to the intervention group. The control group therefore remained at 38 patients.Procedure The 116 patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were sent a letter enclosing written information about the study, and the questionnaires. Randomization was performed by using blocks of 20 patients: 10 were allocated to either an intervention group or a control group. Both groups completed the questionnaires at baseline and after six months. The intervention group also completed the questionnaires after the group-based education programme, one month after baseline. Three patients in the intervention group and six patients in the control group did not return the questionnaires at the six-month measurement. After two reminders they were excluded from the study. The analyses are therefore restricted to ""per protocol"" analyses. When the patients were included in the study they were in clinical remission. The patients' files were scrutinized to identify illness activity during the six-month study period.The multi-professional group-based education programme The content of the multi-professional, group-based education programme was first tested in a pilot study including eleven participants. The result showed that the content was well suited for patients with IBD with the exception of the number of sessions. Many of the patients had difficulty finding time to participate in an education programme. Therefore, after the evaluation, the number of sessions was reduced from four to three. The intervention group was divided into groups of eight to ten patients, and each patient was invited to bring a significant other of his/her own choice. The patients with CD and the patients with UC were divided into separate groups. The education programme was held once a week and consisted of three two-hour sessions. It was scheduled in the evening for the convenience of the patients. A specialist nurse, gastroenterologist, dietician and a medical social worker gave the lectures. The specialist nurse worked as a coordinator and attended every meeting. The content was based on clinical experience, literature studies and contacts with other gastroenterological clinics with experience of similar education programmes. The topics for the sessions were aetiology and nature of the diseases, examinations, treatments, side effects, new research, nutrition, financial issues, psychological reactions, coping, behavioural changes, information concerning the organization and care of IBD patients at the clinic, and demonstration of a sigmoideoscope. During every session there was time to ask questions and to discuss personal experiences. At the last session, the patients received a written summary of the contents of the education programme.Study IIFigure 2. Overview of participants in Study IIParticipants Patients with CD or UC who were in clinical remission and receiving care at the IBD clinic at Danderyd Hospital were invited to participate in the study. To be included, they were to suffer from have no other chronic diseases, have a good understanding of the Swedish language and be able to fill in a questionnaire. They were to have had the disease for less than two years (short-duration group) or more than five years (longduration group). Clinical remission was defined as having no bowel symptoms associated with active disease, i.e. no diarrhoea, no blood in stools and no acute treatment. Furthermore, UC patients were to have an UC-DAI score of 2 or less [109] , and CD patients were to have a HBIc score of less than 5 [107, 108] . A total of 319 patients matched the inclusion criteria and were invited to participate in the study. A total of 197 patients (61%) gave their informed consent and were included. The study population was then divided into a CD group and an UC group. Each group was also divided into separate groups based on short disease duration (less than two years) or long disease duration (more than five years). In the CD group there were 44 patients with short disease duration and 39 patients with long disease duration. In the UC group there were 40 patients with short disease duration and 74 patients with long disease duration.Fulfilled the inclusion criteria n=319 Included n=197Procedure A letter with information about the study and the four questionnaires was sent to the 319 patients that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. One reminder was sent to nonresponders after six weeks. The questionnaires were completed on one occasion.Study IIIParticipants A total of 195 patients with CD and UC who were receiving care at the IBD clinic at Danderyd Hospital were included in the study. They were to be in clinical remission, suffer from no other chronic diseases, have a good understanding of the Swedish language, and be able to fill in a questionnaire. Clinical remission was defined as having no bowel symptoms associated with active disease, i.e. no diarrhoea, no blood in stools and no acute treatment. Furthermore, UC patients were to have an UC-DAI score of 2 or less, and CD patients were to have an HBI score of less than 5.Procedure The patients were sent a letter including information about the study, the RFIPC, the IBDQ and the HI. The patients filled in the questionnaires on one occasion.Study IVFigure 3. Overview of participants in Study IVParticipants A nurse specially trained in IBD, identified the patients from a local register at the IBD clinic at Danderyd Hospital. Those who were eligible for participation were patients with CD or UC, who had suffered from the disease for less than two years, had no other chronic diseases, had not undergone surgery due to their IBD, and were in clinical remission. Clinical remission was defined as having no bowel symptoms associated with active disease, i.e. no diarrhoea, no blood in stools and no acute treatment. Furthermore, UC patients were to have an UC-DAI score of 2 or less, and CD patients were to have an HBI score of less than 5. A total of 113 non-consecutive patients were invited to participate, and 60 (53%) accepted and were included. Of these 60 patients, 50 (84%) participated throughout the whole study. The ten patients who discontinued stated reasons such as low motivation or forgetting to fill in the diary, or they experienced that it was not meaningful since there was no variation in the reported variables.Fulfilled the inclusion criteria n=113 Included n=60 Completed 26 weeks n=50Procedure After identification, the patients were sent a letter including information about the study. Those who gave informed consent were then given detailed information by telephone. After being included, the patients were instructed to fill in a diary every day during a 26-week period. They were asked to send in completed diary pages every fourth week. If the pages were not sent in, a reminder was sent after four weeks. A pre-test study was conducted before the main study. Two patients tested the designed diary by filling it in every day for one month. After the pre-test study the diary was slightly adjusted. For example, an open question was added to give the participants the opportunity to provide other subjective information. Relapse of IBD was defined in the diary according to Trulove and Witt criteria [106] , i.e. blood in stools for patients with UC and for patients with CD in the colon. For patients with CD in the small bowel, relapse was defined as more than two consecutive days of abdominal pain. Identified relapses in the diary were checked by scrutinizing the medical files. Onset of a relapse was considered as the first day with a relapse. A relapse was considered as over when 14 consecutive days had passed with no blood in stools, no diarrhoea, or no abdominal pain. The case-crossover design was used. This is an epidemiological design developed to study triggers for acute events, and constitutes a valuable methodology for establishing causality between stress and relapses in IBD [111] . The method departs from the assumption that if there are factors influencing the onset of an outcome, in this case a relapse in IBD, these would more often be present during a period just before the onset than during periods further from the onset [112] . Only cases were examined and were self-matched by serving as their own controls. Student's t-test and the chi-squared test were performed to compare demographic background data between the intervention group and the control group (Study I), and between the short-duration groups and the long-duration groups (Study II). Cronbach's alpha coefficients were calculated for the instruments HI (Studies I, II, III), SOC (Studies I, II), the IBDQ (Studies I, II, III), and the RFIPC (Studies I, II, III) to provide measures of internal consistency.DATA ANALYSISAnalysis Study I In order to compare the intervention group with the control group at baseline and at six months, and for comparisons in the intervention group at baseline, one month, and six months, analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures was performed. The Mann-Whitney U-test was used for more detailed analysis of the changes over time. Correlation between variables was calculated using Spearman's rank correlation.Analysis Study II Correlation between variables was calculated by using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Significant correlations were displayed for both CD patients and UC patients between the HI, the IBDQ and the RFIPC. A 2 x 2 multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) with SOC and natural log-transformed number of relapses as covariates was performed to examine the impact of diagnosis and disease duration.Analysis Study III Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed on the variance-covariance matrix of the RFIPC items to assess the fit of the factorial structure of the RFIPC to the data. Cronbach's alpha coefficient was calculated to test reliability. In order to follow up the results from the CFA, Spearman's correlation analysis and the Mann-Whitney U-test were performed.Analysis Study IV Exposure frequency during the period just before onset of a relapse (the case period) was compared with exposure frequency during one or several control periods during remission. The matched-pair interval approach and the usual frequency approach were performed. The matched-pair interval approach uses exposure status during a matched time period, e.g. the same weekday as the day before the onset of a relapse, but a week earlier. The usual frequency approach was based on the frequency of exposed days during the control period. The 1-7 days prior to the onset of a relapse were considered as the case period and the 8-14 days prior to the onset of a relapse were considered as the control period. Hazard periods of varying length were tested. Conditional logistic regression was used in the matched-pair interval approach for estimation of odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals. Standard Mantel-Haenzel estimates for sparse data were used for analysis in the usual frequency approach for estimation of OR and 95% confidence intervals.ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS The four studies were all approved by the local Ethics Committee, Karolinska Institutet (Dnr. 01-224, 04-813T). In all four studies, the patients received written information about the study. The information included the aim of the study and assurance of confidentiality. The patients were also informed that participation was voluntary and that they could withdraw from the study at any time. The patients were asked to give their informed consent if they wanted to participate in the study. All data were handled anonymously. The questionnaires used in Studies I, II, III and the diary in Study IV were provided with a patient code to ensure confidentiality. The patient codes and the information about the patients' names are stored in two different locked safes. In Study I, the patients in the control group were invited to participate in the education programme after completion of the questionnaires at the six-month measurement.RESULTSHRQOL AND PATIENT EDUCATION (STUDY I) There were no differences between the intervention group and the control group regarding demographic and disease-related factors. A significant difference was found when comparing the RFIPC at baseline and one month later, showing that patients had lower RFIPC scores immediately after the education programme. When comparing with the control group, no improvement could be seen in HRQOL in patients with IBD at the six-month follow-up. The education programme was highly appreciated by the patients. A significant correlation was found for all patients between the HI and the IBDQ, and the HI and the RFIPC, in the measurements at baseline and at six months, indicating that the higher the perceived general health, the better the perceived HRQOL. There were no differences in gender for any of the measurements.PREDICTORS OF LOW HRQOL (STUDY II) There were no differences between the groups regarding demographic and diseaserelated factors, except for patients in the long-duration groups who had a significantly larger number of relapses compared with patients in the short-duration groups. Disease duration had a significant effect on HRQOL; scores of HRQOL were lower for patients with short disease duration than for patients with long disease duration. There were no significant differences in HRQOL between patients diagnosed with CD and UC. The analysis showed a significant interaction between diagnosis and disease duration with regard to HI and the IBDQ. The analysis displayed significantly lower scores on the HI (low HRQOL) and higher scores on the IBDQ (low HRQOL) for CD patients with short disease duration than the other groups.WORRIES AND CONCERNS (STUDY III) Three models of the RFIPC were tested. The first model to be validated was the singlefactor model of the RFIPC, which is based on the assumption that the variance in the questionnaire could be placed in one single factor of worry. The one-single factor model is the most commonly used scoring procedure in Sweden. The second model was the four-factor model according to Drossman et al. [1] , in which the RFIPC consists of four distinct factors: impact of disease, sexual intimacy, complications, and body stigma. The third and final model was the four-factor model with the addition of correlated error terms between item 5 (developing cancer) and item 6 (dying early), and item 16 (having surgery) and item 17 (having an ostomy bag). Inclusion of correlated error terms for subgroups of items is generally not recommended. However, it was considered to be appropriate in this analysis due to clinical observations. An ostomy bag is often the consequence of having surgery, and the fear of dying early is normally related to concerns about developing cancer. The analysis showed that the single-factor model had poor fit indices. The four-factor model displayed better fit compared with the single-factor model, but failed to approximate the established thresholds for the fit indices. The four-factor model permitted correlated error terms between items 5 and 6, and items 16 and 17 displayed the most adequate fit. All Cronbach's alpha coefficients for the factors in the final model were acceptable (all alphas >0.88). Significant correlations were found between the four factors of the RFIPC and the four factors of the IBDQ and the HI. The correlation between the four factors of the RFIPC and emotional function (the IBDQ) showed the highest correlation coefficients, while correlation coefficients regarding systemic symptoms showed the lowest correlations. Greater worries and concerns regarding impact of disease were reported by CD patients than by UC patients (statistically significant). The factor loadings are standardized loadings.STRESS AS A TRIGGER FACTOR (STUDY IV) Twenty-five patients experienced one or several relapses during the data collection, and a total of 42 relapses were identified. Of the potential trigger factors included in the diary it was only perceived stress that displayed an effect. In 19 of the 42 relapses the patients were exposed to stress on the day before the onset of a relapse. Stress on one day increased the risk of relapse on the next day with an OR of 2.48 (95% CI 1.07-5.78) for the usual frequency, and 2.67 (95% CI 0.71-10.05) for the matched-pair interval analyses. No increased effect estimates were found for hazard periods further than one day from onset. When stratifying level of stress, the analysis showed an effect for high levels of perceived stress. When reporting ""quite a lot"" of stress, an OR of 4.8 (95% CI 1.09-21.10) was found. No statistically increased risk for lower levels of perceived stress was displayed, although elevated effect estimates were found for ""some"" stress. No one reported having ""a lot"" of stress during the day before onset of a relapse. Stratification of the analysis with respect to diagnosis gave an OR of 7.33 (95% CI 0.94-57.33) for CD patients, and 1.88 (95% CI 0.94-4.87) for UC patients. If the analysis was restricted to the first relapse during follow-up, this did not change the results.DISCUSSION The general aim of this thesis was to gain scientific evidence about worries and concerns, HRQOL, and trigger factors for relapses, and to develop and evaluate an education programme. In Studies II and III, newly diagnosed CD patients were found to have the lowest HRQOL, and a questionnaire for measuring worries and concerns was validated. In Study IV, perceived stress was identified as an important factor in triggering relapses in IBD. In Study I, a group-based education programme was developed and evaluated. The education programme was highly appreciated by the patients but no improvements in HRQOL could be found. In the following sections, the discussion will focus on each topic in this thesis.HRQOL AND PATIENT EDUCATION The multi-professional group-based education programme was highly appreciated by the patients. An improvement in HRQOL could be seen in the intervention group immediately after the education programme. However, no improvement in HRQOL could be found six months after attending the education programme when comparing with a control group. These results correspond with other studies where HRQOL was also investigated in IBD patients after attending group-based education programmes. No improvement in HRQOL was found in any of these studies, but the education programmes were highly appreciated by the patients [86, 89, 90, 113] . Another study found that a group-based education programme improved patient knowledge and patient satisfaction, but no improvement could be found in HRQOL here either [91] . Moser et al. found a significant correlation between patients' worries and concerns and their perceived level of information. Lower scores of information level were associated with greater concerns [73] . HRQOL is positively influenced by ""providing information"" [114] , but several questions still remain about the best way of doing this. Being part of a group can provide support simply due to the group dynamic. In one study it could be shown that there was an improvement in emotional and social aspects of HRQOL after attending a support group [115] . There are some differences between this study and Study I in this thesis. They had meetings once a month for 24 months, while we had a total of only three meetings, once a week. The intervention group had better HRQOL scores immediately after attending the education programme. However, this improvement could not be found six months after the education programme. This short-term effect is similar to a result in a study that analyzed the effect of a comprehensive lifestyle modification programme using an intervention group and a control group [116] . A significant great improvement in Short-Form 36 scale physical function and a significant great reduction in anxiety scores could be seen three months after the programme. An improvement could also be seen in the IBDQ scores, although not significant, but no significant differences between the intervention group and the control group were found after twelve months. In another study, a short-term effect could be detected when CD patients were given access to a nurse-led counselling service. An improvement could be seen in HRQOL after six months but the effect was not sustained for 12 months [117] . In one study, disease-related information was found to result in deteriorated HRQOL [118] , but the information was given in the form of information booklets and it may be ineffective to provide disease-related information without the opportunity to discuss questions or concerns that arise. Furthermore, the participants may not have bothered to read the information booklets. Another explanation for the fact that there was no improvement in HRQOL in either this study or our study might be that the patients were perhaps not in remission. Symptom severity is one of the most important associations with reduced HRQOL [4-7, 49, 53, 56-60] . The education programme could readily be applied in the clinic. It was held at the hospital and lectures were given by the working staff, so rooms and lecturers were easy to organize. Even if no improvement could be found in HRQOL after attending a multiprofessional group-based education programme, the patients were positive and satisfied overall.PREDICTORS OF LOW HRQOL Study II showed that HRQOL was poorer for patients with short disease duration than for patients with long disease duration. There were no differences between CD and UC patients. However, a significant effect on the interaction between diagnosis and duration was found, indicating that patients with CD and short disease duration have the poorest HRQOL. These results contradict the results from another study where no differences in HRQOL could be found between CD patients with long disease duration and patients with short disease duration [9] . However, it is difficult to compare these results with those of Study II, since they compared patients who had been diagnosed less than 10 years earlier with patients whose diagnosis was more than 20 years old. The patients in the short-duration group in this study were comparable with the patients in the longduration group in Study II. Several studies have examined whether there are any differences in HRQOL between CD patients and UC patients. In Study II, no differences could be found between CD patients and UC patients when only diagnosis was considered. This correlates with other studies [5, 62, 63] . However, some studies have found that CD patients have poorer HRQOL [3, 8, 53, 61] . CD patients are more often in hospital compared with UC patients, and they also have more re-admissions [119] . Since CD and UC differ in several ways, for example in symptoms and complications, it makes sense not to treat the diseases in the same way, also with regard to giving disease-related information. Few studies have investigated whether there are differences in HRQOL due to disease duration. One study compared CD patients and UC patients in their first relapse with patients who had reported at least three relapses [65] . In contrast to Study II, no difference in HRQOL could be found, indicating that it is similar in debut and recurrent relapses for both CD patients and UC patients. However, the designs in the two studies are very different, making it difficult to compare them. For example, for the patients in the group with several relapses, disease duration was five years at the most. In Study II, the mean number of years for disease duration of the patients in the long-duration group was 14 years for CD patients and 12 years for UC patients. As in Study II, other studies have found that patients with long disease duration have better HRQOL [5, 7, 120] . The most common course seems to be a decrease in symptoms over time [20, 21] . Since disease activity is the most important factor for decreased HRQOL, this may be one reason why the patients in the long-duration group had better HRQOL. However, here too, there are some contradictory findings. Etienney et al. examined CD patients and could find no evidence that CD activity burned out in time [121] . One study found that 20% of IBD patients expressed a need for psychotherapy. Anxiety, worries and short disease duration were some of the reasons for this [77] . Non-adherence is a common problem in IBD. Non-adherence increases when the patients are < 40 years old and have disease duration < 5 years. Poor adherence may result in more frequent relapses and a disabling disease course [83] . One way of increasing adherence is to give the patients disease-related education. Since the number of patients with IBD is increasing, it is important to know which patients have the greatest need of education. It is also important to gain more insight into which issues an education programme should concentrate on. In this way an education programme that focuses on the most important topics could be provided for a special patient group. The results in Study II suggest that it is newly diagnosed CD patients that need diseaserelated education most. This correlates with a study that found an improvement in HRQOL in a group of IBD patients with disease duration ≤3 years after attending an education programme. No improvement in HRQOL could be found in patients with disease duration ≥ 3 years [90] . Bregenzer et al. also conclude that patients should be educated at the beginning of their disease in order to achieve the optimal effect [89] .WORRIES AND CONCERNS IBD patients have many worries and concerns related to the disease. Worries and concerns about IBD may affect the patient's adjustment and compliance to the illness [2] . Patients are influenced by the seesawing of their fears and hopes. This seems to be linked to what they know and what they do not know, and what cannot be known because of the nature of the illness [74] . Very few patients ask friends or neighbours for help when they need it. They either do not want people outside their closest family to know about their condition or they do not want to impose on people [122] . However, patients have also expressed a feeling of increasing the burden when discussing their worries and concerns with a family member [10] . It is important for healthcare professionals to recognize and address the worries and concerns that are important for the patient, not only the issues that the healthcare professionals feel are important. In both the clinical and the research setting it is essential to have validated instruments in order to assess and measure worries and concerns in IBD patients. A more detailed assessment of the worries and concerns provides useful information about HRQOL. Two IBD-specific questionnaires, the IBDQ and the RFIPC, have shown adequate validity and reliability. The RFIPC is better for reflecting the psychological and social aspects of IBD from the patient's point of view, while the IBDQ provides a better reflection of disease activity [123] . Therefore, when measuring worries and concerns in IBD, the RFIPC is the most appropriate choice. In Study III, the factor structure of the Swedish version of the RFIPC was validated. The study focused on validation of the factor structure that was suggested by Drossman [1] , with a differentiation of the components of worries. In Sweden the RFIPC is most often used by reporting the sum score or ranking the items [4, 58, 124] . The results in Study III suggest that use of a single-factor model (sum score) of the RFIPC is an unacceptable structure of this measure. This model suggests that a single underlying uni-dimensional latent variable of the patient's worries is manifested in the items of the RFIPC. No matter what the worries and concerns are about, the patient is characterized by a degree of worries and concerns. Study III displayed that a slightly modified model of the original factor structure of RFIPC had the most acceptable fit. In this version, the patient's worries and concerns can be divided into distinct components: impact of disease, sexual intimacy, complications, and body stigma. To be able to address worries and concerns in clinical practice it is important to know specifically what each patient is worried about. This approach provides more nuanced data and useful information in both clinical and research settings. Healthcare professionals gain information about what each patient is worried about and this enables them to provide the patient with appropriate education and support. Using the RFIPC by reporting each item and/or ranking the items is another method, although in this way it may be difficult to get an overview of patients' worries and concerns. The factorial structure according to Drossman that was replicated in Study III makes it easier to gain information in a clinical setting about which issues are most worrying for each patient. It also provides important data in subgroups of patients. Some may have worries related to complications, while another subgroup may worry about the impact of the disease. In Study III, significantly greater worries and concerns in the factor impact of disease were reported by CD patients than by UC patients. These findings give more detailed information about patients' worries and concerns compared with using a sum score or ranking of items. The RFIPC has been validated in Sweden, both in UC patients [125] and in CD patients [126] . In the study with CD patients, an exploratory factor analysis was conducted and four factors similar to those of Study II and Drossman were found. However, in some ways the factors are different from Drossman's original factors. In this study, the factors complications, achievements, intimacy, and stigma were found. A Norwegian study also validated the RFIPC using exploratory factor analysis [127] , finding six factors, only one of which, sexual intimacy, was identical to a factor in Drossman's original validation. Another study that conducted an exploratory factor analysis could not distinguish any factors in the RFIPC questions [128] . It was therefore concluded that no interpretation of answers regarding different aspects of patient concerns could be made. Study III also displayed significant correlations between the factors of RFIPC and the factors of IBDQ (bowel symptoms, systemic symptoms, social function, and emotional function) and the HI. Furthermore, the findings showed that social function is associated with worries concerning impact of disease and sexual intimacy but not with complications or body stigma. The results also suggest that bowel symptoms are unrelated to worries about complications. The more detailed assessment provided by using the factorial structure of the RFIPC, as suggested by Drossman and replicated in Study III, gives more detailed information about disease-related worries and concerns of IBD patients in both research and clinical settings, as these components of worries are differently related to HRQOL and general health.STRESS AS A TRIGGER FACTOR Study IV showed that perceived acute stress can be considered as a trigger factor for relapses in IBD. Patients with IBD believe that the severity of the disease is affected by stress and their attitude to life [10] . Levels of stress and the nature of what is stressful are very similar for patients with IBD and healthy controls [129] . Those in remission even reported lower levels of daily stress compared with the healthy controls. This may reflect a positive rebound effect of having some relief from the disease [129] . Also, the use of active coping strategies to deal with stress is similar no matter whether an individual suffers from IBD or not [130] . Studies that examined the association between stress and relapses in IBD are inconclusive. Some studies have found that stressful life events do not trigger relapses in IBD [42, 43, 131] . In studies where no association between stress and relapses in IBD has been found, it is most often stressful life events that are investigated. However, other studies have shown that perceived stress may trigger a relapse in IBD [35] [36] [37] [38] . Bernstein et al. examined both stressful life events and perceived stress, and found that both could be considered as trigger factors for relapses in IBD [35] . Mawdsley et al. displayed that experimental stress causes increases in a range of inflammatory variables. Each of these variables may contribute to cause relapses in IBD [39] . It has also been suggested that studies of stress should analyze CD and UC separately [41, 45] . UC has more often proved to be a trigger of relapses than CD. This might be due to difficulties in defining clear criteria for relapses and remission in CD [41] . This contradicts the results from Study IV where the trigger effect of stress seemed to be higher in CD patients. Bitton et al. were also able to show that high stress influenced relapse in CD patients [36] . In Study IV, high levels of stress are found to increase the risk of relapse the next day. This contradicts the results of Levenstein et al., where it is rather long-term perceived stress that is considered as a trigger factor [38] . The patients were followed for 45 months or until the patient experienced a relapse. Relapse status could be monitored for up to 68 months. In this study, no increase in stress levels just before a relapse could be found. The results suggest 8-11 months before symptoms began. Levenstein et al. also conclude that it is perceived stress that appears to be a trigger factor for relapses and not stressful life events or depressive symptoms. A strength of this study is that the patients were followed with proctoscopy to establish the relapses. Examination with proctoscopy not only identifies the relapses, but also classifies them in normal mucosa, minimal, mild, moderate, or severe activity. In Study IV, the relapses were identified according to symptoms that the patients stated in the diary. Patients' files were however scrutinized after the data collection in order to check the identified relapses. But since not all patients seek hospital care when they have a relapse, this method does not provide complete information. Eighteen of the 42 identified relapses had not been recorded in the hospital. This does not mean that the patients did not have real relapses. Often patients with IBD start a treatment on their own without contacting the IBD clinic. Another difference between these studies is the duration of disease. In Study IV, patients with disease duration of less than two years were included, while the patients in the study by Levenstein had a mean disease duration of 6.5 years. Patients with a chronic disease and with long disease duration may have changed some factors in their way of life in order to feel better. There may therefore be some difficulties in examining and comparing patients with different disease duration. In Study IV, patients were followed on a daily basis, whereas patients were followed monthly in the study by Levenstein. This difference in design could also explain the differences in result. In Study IV, patients were only followed for six months and therefore no long-term effects could be examined. It is also unclear whether stress management programmes have an effect in reducing relapses. Stress management psychotherapy does not improve disease activity or disease course in IBD patients [46] . However, one study found that patients who received a brief behavioural intervention, targeting stress and disease self-management experienced a reduction in risk of relapse [132] . One study gave 60 patients with UC a structured training programme which included stress management training. The use of relaxing techniques proved to be a significant predictor of improvement in the psychological sum score after three months of therapy [116] . The strength of Study IV is its design. The patients acted as their own controls and were followed on a daily basis during a period of six months. The case-crossover design eliminates all confounding factors.METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS In Study I, all patients were in remission at baseline. In order to examine if the patients were still in remission at the six-month measurement, the patients' files were scrutinized. The investigation showed that 42% in the intervention group and 22% in the control group had relapsed or had symptoms of their disease. Disease activity influences the HRQOL negatively, and this may have made it difficult to measure HRQOL after six months and compare with the baseline measurement. In Study I, it is possible that it is not HRQOL that should be measured to evaluate an education programme. Instead it may be the patient's worries and concerns or knowledge score that should be measured. In Study III, the analysis is performed in a single primary sample. Therefore it is not cross-validated. To establish the results more firmly, a cross-validation of the suggested factor structure of the RFIPC in other samples is advisable. In Study III, correlated error terms were included. This is generally not recommended, but correlation of error terms of these items was considered appropriate. For example, having an ostomy bag is associated with surgery, and the fear of dying early can be related to developing cancer. One limitation in Study IV is the small number of patients. It is difficult to include patients in a study where they are asked to fill in a diary on a daily basis. Even if the diary was easy to fill in, and only took about one minute per day, several patients felt it was too much work and did not want to participate. In Study IV, the patients were asked about their perceived stress in only one question. Other studies that measured perceived stress have used validated questionnaires [35] [36] [37] [38] . We chose the one single question since we wanted to measure the presence and degree of perceived stress on a daily basis during a period of six months. Under these circumstances it is imperative to use an easy and fast instrument for the patients to fill in, otherwise they might drop out. Another limitation in Study IV was the risk of recall bias. If the patients forgot to fill in the diary one day they might have done it retrospectively. However, this retrospective reporting is most likely when there was no variation in the reported variables. If symptoms were present or if some factors in life were unusual, patients would probably have been reminded of the study that they were included in. Nevertheless, in spite of the potential for misclassification due to memory recall, the strength of the design is that the patients did not know about the definition of relapse or the time periods of interest. Of the potential trigger factors included in the diary in Study IV, it was only stress that displayed an effect. Diet, smoking, infections, and antibiotics did not show an effect. The sample size was small and difficulties in measuring, for example, diet may be one reason for the non-effect. The patients were asked to fill in if they had more or less sugar, fat, and/or fibre compared with their normal food intake. In the diary there was an explanation of what sugar, fat and fibre could be classified as. But it might nevertheless have been a problem for them to interpret the information and give an adequate answer.CONCLUSION A multi-professional group-based education programme could readily be applied in the clinic. Patients had improved RFIPC scores immediately after the education programme, although when comparing with the control group, no improvement could be seen in HRQOL at the six-month follow-up. The education programme was highly appreciated by the patients. HRQOL is poorer for patients with short disease duration than for patients with long disease duration. No differences could be found between CD and UC patients. Patients with CD and short disease duration have the poorest HRQOL. The factorial structure of the RFIPC as suggested by Drossman [1] was replicated in a Swedish version. The four separate factors identified in this structure provide more detailed information about disease-related worries and concerns of IBD patients than the sum score. Perceived stress may act as a trigger for relapses in IBD. A high level of stress one day increases the risk of relapse the next day.CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS AND FUTURE STUDIES 10.1 CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS No improvement could be found in HRQOL after attending an education programme, but the patients were positive and satisfied overall. They became better informed about how to manage their disease. The increased knowledge may improve compliance, and lead to a better understanding of treatment, and, by extension, to fewer relapses. Patients with CD and short disease duration have the lowest HRQOL and are in most need of education and support. It is important for healthcare professionals to identify patients with the greatest need for education and support, in order to develop effective nursing intervention programmes. The more detailed version of the RFIPC may help to provide each patient with the appropriate education and support. By identifying potential trigger factors for relapses in IBD there is also a potential for preventing relapses by influencing for example stress levels and optimizing the clinical care of these patients.FUTURE STUDIES Further investigations with larger power are needed to confirm the findings regarding stress as a trigger for relapses in IBD. The case-crossover design is a valuable method and the structured diary would be a useful tool in further studies. Further investigations are needed to examine the worries and concerns of IBD patients in order to develop more adequate intervention programmes. The RFIPC with four factors is a useful tool for future studies. There is also a need for more qualitative studies in order to more deeply examine HRQOL, as well as the worries and concerns of IBD patients.POPULÄRVETENSKAPLIG SAMMANFATTNINGSammanfattning Ingen förbättring i HRQOL framkom efter att patienterna deltagit i ett gruppbaserat utbildningsprogram. Utbildningen var dock uppskattad av patienterna. Patienter med Crohns sjukdom och kort sjukdomsduration har sämst HRQOL och har störst behov av utbildning och stöd. Genom att använda frågeformuläret RFIPC med de fyra faktorerna som föreslagits i originalversionen ges en mer detaljerad information om patienternas sjukdomsrelaterade oro både i forskningssammanhang och i den kliniska vården. Detta kan hjälpa sjukvårdspersonalen att erbjuda varje enskild patient lämplig utbildning och stöd. Det som försämrar HRQOL mest negativt är skov. Att identifiera faktorer som triggar skov ger en möjlighet att också om möjligt påverka denna trigger. Hög grad av stress verkar kunna öka risken för skov.

Dessa är kroniska sjukdomar som går i skov (sjukdomsattacker). De vanligaste symtomen är diarré, blodtillblandad avföring, buksmärtor, trötthet och viktnedgång. Vanligaste åldern att insjukna är 15-35 års ålder. Varför man får IBD är ännu okänt men man tror att det är en kombination av flera faktorer. Hur sjukdomsbilden ska komma att se ut och hur ofta en patient med IBD kommer att få skov är okänt. Stress verkar dock vara en potentiell så kallad triggerfaktor till skov i IBD.Patienter med IBD måste anpassa sig till en livslång sjukdom och göra många anpassningar i livet. Studier har visat att de har en sämre hälsorelaterad livskvalitet (Health-Related Quality of Life=HRQOL) jämfört med en frisk population. Det som påverkar HRQOL mest negativt är skov i sjukdomen. Patienter med IBD känner också mycket oro relaterat till sjukdomen. Det som ger mest oro är relaterat till kirurgi, energinivå, att få en påse på magen, osäkerhet kring sjukdomens natur, effekt av medicinering, att bli en börda för andra, tappa kontroll över tarmen och att utveckla cancer.Patienter med kroniska sjukdomar som IBD behöver kunskap om sjukdomen samt hur den ska hanteras. Att vara väl utbildad inom sin sjukdom kan ge en positiv påverkan på HRQOL samt en god kapacitet till att hantera sin behandling. var att skapa ett utbildningsprogram anpassat till nydiagnostiserade patienter med IBD och som lätt kunde appliceras på kliniken samt att undersöka om ett gruppbaserat utbildningsprogram kan förbättra HRQOL hos patienter med IBD. 93 patienter med Crohns sjukdom eller ulcerös colit deltog i studien. Hälften lottades till en interventionsgrupp och fick delta i ett gruppbaserat utbildningsprogram medan hälften lottades till en kontrollgrupp. HRQOL mättes med hjälp av fyra frågeformulär som fylldes i när de inkluderades i studien samt efter sex månader. Interventionsgruppen fyllde dessutom i frågeformulären efter en månad (direkt efter avslutat utbildningsprogram). Ingen skillnad framkom i HRQOL mellan interventionsgrupp och kontrollgrupp vid mätningen efter sex månader. Interventionsgruppen hade dock förbättrade värden i HRQOL vid mätningen efter en månad, direkt efter utbildningsprogrammet. Det gruppbaserade utbildningsprogrammet var uppskattat av patienterna.Syftet med delstudie II var att identifiera vad som kan förutsäga nedsatt HRQOL hos patienter med IBD samt göra en jämförelse mellan Crohns sjukdom och ulcerös colit och med sjukdomsduration. 197 patienter med Crohns sjukdom eller ulcerös colit deltog i studien. De fyllde i fyra frågeformulär som mätte HRQOL vid ett tillfälle.Ingen skillnad i HRQOL framkom mellan patienter med Crohns sjukdom och patienter med ulcerös colit. Patienter med kort sjukdomsduration (< 2 år) hade sämre HRQOL när de jämfördes med patienter med lång sjukdomsduration (> 5 år). De som hade sämst HRQOL var patienter med Crohns sjukdom och kort sjukdomsduration. Syftet i delstudie III var att utvärdera frågeformuläret Rating Form of Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patient Concerns (RFIPC) utifrån svenska förhållanden. 195 patienter med Crohns sjukdom eller ulcerös colit deltog i studien. De fyllde i RFIPC samt ytterligare två frågeformulär vid ett tillfälle. RFIPC används för att mäta oro och bekymmer hos patienter med IBD. Det innehåller 25 områden angående oro relaterat till IBD. Dessa områden kan till exempel handla om ""att bli opererad"", ""att få cancer"", ""att kunna få barn"", ""att lukta illa"". RFIPC används i Sverige men oftast utan att använda den struktur som förslogs i originalversionen. Där delades de 25 områdena in i fyra faktorer medan i Sverige räknas oftast en totalsumma på alla områden. Resultatet i delstudien visar otydliga anpassningsmått då RFIPC används med totalsumma. Originalversionen, med lätt förändring, visade det bästa anpassningsmåttet.Syftet med delstudie IV var att undersöka om upplevd stress kan starta ett skov i IBD. 60 patienter med Crohns sjukdom eller ulcerös colit deltog i en dagboksstudie. Dagboken innehöll frågor angående symtom i deras sjukdom samt en fråga om stress. Patienterna fyllde i dagboken varje dag under sex månader. Analyserna visade att hög grad av stress en dag kan öka risken för skov dagen efter. Det övergripande syftet med denna avhandling var att samla vetenskaplig fakta om oro och bekymmer, HRQOL och triggerfaktorer till skov samt att skapa och utvärdera ett utbildningsprogram.

Methods: A multi-centred, cross-sectional, correlational feasibility study was employed. A consecutive sample of 21 patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis were recruited from two IBD centres in the Republic of Ireland. The IBD Fatigue scale was used to measure fatigue and triaxial accelerometers (ActiGraph wGT3X-BT) objectively measured physical activity levels and intensity of activity undertaken during seven consecutive days. Results: A moderate level of fatigue (IBDF Section 1 Md (IQR) = 11 (6-12)), predominantly intermittent in nature (76.2%) was reported by participants (81% female; 66.7% Crohn's disease; 71% active disease). On average, participants self-reported sleeping 9 h per night. Over the week, the intensity of activity was predominantly sedentary (Md 5 days, 19 h, 33 min) or light (Md 21 h, 44 min). The median moderate-to-vigorous intensity of physical activity per day was 36 min and step count over the week was 50,732 steps. A strong, positive, statistically significant relationship was found between level of fatigue and average kCal per day (r s = 0.538, p = 0.047, n = 14), indicating that those with greater physical activity energy expenditure had higher levels of fatigue. A moderate, positive, relationship was found between level and impact of fatigue, and light intensity of activity over the week (IBDF Section 1 r s = 0.391, p = 0.080; IBDF Section 2 r s = 0.365, p = 0.104, n = 21), indicating that those engaged in greater light intensity physical activity experienced higher levels and impact of fatigue. In contrast, a strong, negative, statistically significant relationship was found between time in vigorous activity over the week and impact of fatigue (r s = -0.812, p = 0.050, n = 6) for those in remission, suggesting that participants undertaking more vigorous physical activity had a lower impact of fatigue. Background: Because inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) affects women in reproductive age, knowledge and beliefs about pregnancy must be assessed in those women. The aim of this study was to compare (a) knowledge level and beliefs about pregnancy before and after educational intervention and (b) the same parameters in the group of women who underwent this educational intervention to women who did not undergo training. Methods: Eligible were outpatient IBD women of reproductive age. After obtaining a consent, demographics, clinical data and current treatment were recorded and all patients were invited to complete (a) the Crohn's and Colitis Pregnancy Knowledge Score (CCPKnow), which categorised in poor (0-7), adequate (8-10), good (11-13) and very good (≥14) level and (b) a structured tool formed for this study which assessed pregnancy beliefs. Subsequently, patients were randomly distributed in two groups, control group (CG) and intervention group (IG). Women in IG received a face-to-face educational training regarding pregnancy, and were given an educational leaflet. Then, patients were followed in the IBD Clinic at 3, 6, and 12 months after baseline with clinical assessment, laboratory tests and filling the same questionnaires. Results: Overall, 43 and 39 women were allocated to the IG and CG, respectively (Table 1 ). Basic demographics and clinical characteristics. At baseline, both groups had poor knowledge. After educational program the level of Knowledge increased significantly in the IG over baseline and was persistently high during follow-up (Table 2 ).CCPKnow results. In both groups, clinical characteristics and beliefs affected the CCPKnow score statistically (Table 3 ). Statistically significant results for both groups. Differences in knowledge between groups were statistically significant in every phase of the study (p < 0.05), which indicates that a woman in IG is more likely to have a better knowledge level. Beliefs, in both groups, did not change significantly during the study. Conclusions: CCPKnow level was enhanced and maintained in IG after one educational session statistically. Probably education in women with IBD bridges the gap between patients and healthcare providers and finally reduces the percentage of voluntary childness in IBD women.Conclusions: A larger multi-centre study investigating the relationship between fatigue and physical activity and intensity of activity is feasible and warranted. It has the potential to contribute to the modelling and development of a physical activity intervention specifically designed for the management of IBD fatigue.
