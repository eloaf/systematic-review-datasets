    "title": "Nirmatrelvir combined with ritonavir for preventing and treating COVID\u201019",
    "abstract": "Background Oral nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid\u00ae) aims to avoid severe COVID\u201019 in asymptomatic people or those with mild symptoms, thereby decreasing hospitalization and death. Due to its novelty, there are currently few published study results. It remains to be evaluated for which indications and patient populations the drug is suitable.\u00a0    Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid\u00ae) plus standard of care compared to standard of care with or without placebo, or any other intervention for treating COVID\u201019 and for preventing SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection.  To explore equity aspects in subgroup analyses. To keep up to date with the evolving evidence base using a living systematic review (LSR) approach and make new relevant studies available to readers in\u2010between publication of review updates.    Search methods We searched the Cochrane COVID\u201019 Study Register, Scopus, and WHO COVID\u201019 Global literature on coronavirus disease database, identifying completed and ongoing studies without language restrictions and incorporating studies up to 11 July 2022.\u00a0  This is a LSR. We conduct monthly update searches that are being made publicly available on the open science framework (OSF) platform.    Selection criteria Studies were eligible if they were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus standard of care with standard of care with or without placebo, or any other intervention for treatment of people with confirmed COVID\u201019 diagnosis, irrespective of disease severity or treatment setting, and for prevention of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection.  We screened all studies for research integrity. Studies were ineligible if they had been retracted, or if they were not prospectively registered including appropriate ethics approval.    Data collection and analysis We followed standard Cochrane methodology and used the Cochrane risk of bias 2 tool. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for the following outcomes: 1. to treat outpatients with mild COVID\u201019; 2. to treat inpatients with moderate\u2010to\u2010severe COVID\u201019: mortality, clinical worsening or improvement, quality of life, (serious) adverse events, and viral clearance; 3. to prevent SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection in post\u2010exposure prophylaxis (PEP); and 4. pre\u2010exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) scenarios: SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection, development of COVID\u201019 symptoms, mortality, admission to hospital, quality of life, and (serious) adverse events.  We explored inequity by subgroup analysis for elderly people, socially\u2010disadvantaged people with comorbidities, populations from LICs and LMICs, and people from different ethnic and racial backgrounds.    Main results As of 11 July 2022, we included one RCT with 2246 participants in outpatient settings with mild symptomatic COVID\u201019 comparing nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus standard of care with standard of care plus placebo. Trial participants were unvaccinated, without previous confirmed SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection, had a symptom onset of no more than five days before randomization, and were at high risk for progression to severe disease. Prohibited prior or concomitant therapies included medications highly dependent on CYP3A4 for clearance and CYP3A4 inducers.\u00a0  We identified eight ongoing studies. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for treating COVID\u201019 in outpatient settings with asymptomatic or mild disease  For the specific population of unvaccinated, high\u2010risk patients nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus standard of care compared to standard of care plus placebo may reduce all\u2010cause mortality at 28 days (risk ratio (RR) 0.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.00 to 0.68; 1 study, 2224 participants; estimated absolute effect: 11 deaths per 1000 people receiving placebo compared to 0 deaths per 1000 people receiving nirmatrelvir/ritonavir; low\u2010certainty evidence, and admission to hospital or death within 28 days (RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.27; 1 study, 2224 participants; estimated absolute effect: 61 admissions or deaths per 1000 people receiving placebo compared to eight admissions or deaths per 1000 people receiving nirmatrelvir/ritonavir; low\u2010certainty evidence).  Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus standard of care may reduce serious adverse events during the study period compared to standard of care plus placebo (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.41; 1 study, 2224 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus standard of care probably has little or no effect on treatment\u2010emergent adverse events (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.10; 1 study, 2224 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence), and probably increases treatment\u2010related adverse events such as dysgeusia and diarrhoea during the study period compared to standard of care plus placebo (RR 2.06, 95% CI 1.44 to 2.95; 1 study, 2224 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus standard of care probably decreases discontinuation of study drug due to adverse events compared to standard of care plus placebo (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.80; 1 study, 2224 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence).  No study results were identified for improvement of clinical status, quality of life, and viral clearance.\u00a0  Subgroup analyses for equity   Most study participants were younger than 65 years (87.1% of the : modified intention to treat (mITT1) population with 2085 participants), of white ethnicity (71.5%), and were from UMICs or HICs (92.1% of study centres). Data on comorbidities were insufficient.\u00a0  The outcome \u2018admission to hospital or death\u2019 was investigated for equity: age (< 65 years versus \u2265 65 years) and ethnicity (Asian versus Black versus White versus others). There was no difference between subgroups of age. The effects favoured treatment with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for the White ethnic group. Estimated effects in the other ethnic groups included the line of no effect (RR = 1). No subgroups were reported for comorbidity status and World Bank country classification by income level. No subgroups were reported for other outcomes.  Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for treating COVID\u201019 in inpatient settings with moderate to severe disease  No studies available. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for preventing SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection (PrEP and PEP)  No studies available.   Authors' conclusions There is low\u2010certainty evidence that nirmatrelvir/ritonavir reduces the risk of all\u2010cause mortality and hospital admission or death based on one trial investigating unvaccinated COVID\u201019 participants without previous infection that were at high risk and with symptom onset of no more than five days. There is low\u2010 to moderate\u2010certainty evidence that nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is safe in people without prior or concomitant therapies including medications highly dependent on CYP3A4.  Regarding equity aspects, except for ethnicity, no differences in effect size and direction were identified.  No evidence is available on nirmatrelvir/ritonavir to treat hospitalized people with COVID\u201019 and to prevent a SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection.  We will continually update our search and make search results available on OSF.",

If studies included participants with a confirmed or suspected COVID\u201019 diagnosis, we used only the data for the patient population with confirmed COVID\u201019 diagnosis. COVID\u201019 severity was classified according to the WHO clinical progression scale (Marshall 2020) into mild (WHO 1 to 3), moderate (WHO 4 to 5), and severe (WHO 6 to 9). In cases where data have not been reported separately for people with confirmed or suspected COVID\u201019 diagnosis, we excluded the study. We synthesized evidence for both, post\u2010exposure prophylaxis (PEP) and pre\u2010exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) scenarios. For post\u2010exposure prophylaxis, we included studies investigating participants who were not infected with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 at enrolment (negative RT\u2010PCR), but were at high risk of developing the infection following exposure to infected people or infectious viral particles. For pre\u2010exposure prophylaxis, we included studies investigating participants who were not infected with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 at enrolment (negative RT\u2010PCR) and were not yet exposed to infected people or infectious viral particles, but are at increased risk of contacting the disease (e.g. healthcare workers). Participants in both settings were eligible regardless of age, gender, ethnicity, serology status, vaccination status, previous SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection, and risk factors for developing severe COVID\u201019.

We used different outcome sets for the use of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for treating people with COVID\u201019 in the out\u2010 and inpatient setting, and for preventing SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. If studies were eligible for inclusion\u00a0regarding study design, population, intervention, and comparator, but no outcomes of interest have been reported, they were not included for meta\u2010analysis.

Prospective registration is defined as registration of a trial before enrolment of the first participant as defined by the WHO. It must be determined whether the registers registered (date first posted) without delay at this point in the pandemic. In case of doubt, check for the date first submitted or the authors must be asked for the submission date.      Are there any inconsistencies in details such as dates and study methods reported in the publication and in the registration documents?    Compare study dates (enrolment, duration, completion) and methods (study type, allocation, masking) between publication and protocol.\u00a0    If date of registration is unclear or if prospectively registered, but with inconclusive information, (1) send a request to the authors and (2) hold the study in awaiting classification until clarification      3   Ethics approval    Is an ethics approval reported in the publication?   e.g. the study was authorized by the ethics committee XY located in XY.   If ethics approval or participants\u2019 consent is not adequate, exclude the study.  If ethics approval or participants\u2019 consent is unclear or incomplete, (1) send a request to the authors and (2) hold the study in awaiting classification until clarification.      Is an ethics approval number reported?   Check in the publication, study report and study protocol     Is the name and location of the ethics committee reported?   Check in the publication, study report and study protocol     Does a nationally recognized ethics committee as defined in the country\u2019s clinical trial regulations give the ethics committee approval?    Check the ethics committee on the WHO list of national ethics committees (https://apps.who.int/ethics/nationalcommittees/) and the specific regulations for the country on NIH Clinical Trials Regulation website (https://clinregs.niaid.nih.gov/country/mexico#_top).      Does the study require written informed consent from participants?   Check in the publication, study report and study protocol     4   Study authorship    Are the authors\u2019 affiliations and countries the study is reported to have taken place in consistent?    Check in the publication, study report and study protocol   If study authorship is unclear, (1) send a request to the authors and (2) hold the study in awaiting classification until clarification.  If study authorship is still not plausible after contacting the authors,exclude the study.  \u00a0     Are countries specified in different parts of the article or as compared to the trials registry consistent?    Check in the publication, study report and study protocol     Is the number of authors plausible for the study design (e.g. a single author article reporting a randomized controlled trial is impossible)?    Check in the publication, study report and study protocol     5   Methods reporting    Is the study design (e.g. randomization) reported in sufficient detail?   It has to be clear that the study was truthfully randomized. The method used for the randomization must be described and the process must lead to a random allocation of the participants. The sole designation \"randomized study\" is not sufficient.    If study design is not reported in sufficient detail, (1) send a request to the authors and (2) hold the study in awaiting classification until clarification.  If study turns out to be non\u2010randomized following author contact, exclude the study.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0     Are baseline details reported in sufficient detail to assess whether randomization worked properly?    Check whether patients characteristics, e.g. risk factors for COVID\u201019 (age, gender, comorbidities) and co\u2010interventions, are reported      6   Results    Is the number of patients recruited within the timeframe with the condition plausible?   Check in the publication. Justify the decision based on clinical experience. The decision should be verifiable.    If study results are not plausible, (1) send a request to the authors and (2) hold the study in awaiting classification until clarification.  If, after contacting the author, it turns out that study results are not plausible or fabricated,exclude the study.  \u00a0     Is there a realistic response rate or number of participants lost to follow up? In cases with zero losses to follow\u2010up, is there a plausible explanation (e.g. small number of participants, short\u2010term follow\u2010up)?      Is the study free from results that could be implausible (e.g. massive risk reduction, unexpected outlier data, unusual frequency of an outcome)?      Does the number of participants (e.g. women) in each group coincide with the reported randomization method (e.g. block randomization)?    Check in the publication, study report and study protocol     Is there no noteworthy overlap in text/data with other published articles by the same or different authors without explanation?      Is there no excessive similarity or difference in the characteristics of the study participants between groups?      Are there no discrepancies between data reported in figures, tables, and text?     Are there no calculation errors (e.g. number of participants, percentages, proportions)?       Potentially eligible RCTs identified during screening were assessed for research integrity hierarchically considering domain 1 to 6. Retraction, lack of prospective registration, lack of adequate ethical approval with informed written consent, implausible study authorship, lack of truthful randomization, implausible study results were triggers that led to exclusion of a RCT. Concerns in any domain put the study in \u2018awaiting classification\u2019 and led to further investigations. If no concerns appeared through all domains or could be clarified, e.g. in correspondence with study authors, the RCT met criteria for inclusion in the review and was processed further. For the next review update, included RCTs and RCTs \u2018awaiting classification\u2019 must be reassessed for retraction notices."
