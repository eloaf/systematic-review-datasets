    "title": "Prognostic factors for the development and progression of proliferative diabetic retinopathy in people with diabetic retinopathy",
    "abstract": "Background Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is characterised by neurovascular degeneration as a result of chronic hyperglycaemia. Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is the most serious complication of DR and can lead to total (central and peripheral) visual loss. PDR is characterised by the presence of abnormal new blood vessels, so\u2010called \u201cnew vessels,\u201d at the optic disc (NVD) or elsewhere in the retina (NVE). PDR can progress to high\u2010risk characteristics (HRC) PDR (HRC\u2010PDR), which is defined by the presence of NVD more than one\u2010fourth to one\u2010third disc area in size plus vitreous haemorrhage or pre\u2010retinal haemorrhage, or vitreous haemorrhage or pre\u2010retinal haemorrhage obscuring more than one disc area. In severe cases, fibrovascular membranes grow over the retinal surface and tractional retinal detachment with sight loss can occur, despite treatment. Although most, if not all, individuals with diabetes will develop DR if they live long enough, only some progress to the sight\u2010threatening PDR stage.\u00a0    Objectives To determine risk factors for the development of PDR and HRC\u2010PDR in people with diabetes and DR.    Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register; 2022, Issue 5), Ovid MEDLINE, and Ovid Embase. The date of the search was 27 May 2022. Additionally, the search was supplemented by screening reference lists of eligible articles. There were no restrictions to language or year of publication.\u00a0    Selection criteria We included prospective or retrospective cohort studies and case\u2010control longitudinal studies evaluating prognostic factors for the development and progression of PDR, in people who have not had previous treatment for DR. The target population consisted of adults (\u226518 years of age) of any gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and geographical location, with non\u2010proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) or PDR with less than HRC\u2010PDR, diagnosed as per standard clinical practice. Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts, and full\u2010text articles, to determine eligibility; discrepancies were resolved through discussion. We considered prognostic factors measured at baseline and any other time points during the study and in any clinical setting. Outcomes were evaluated at three and eight years (\u00b1 two years) or lifelong.\u00a0    Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data from included studies using a data extraction form that we developed and piloted prior to the data collection stage. We resolved any discrepancies through discussion. We used the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool to assess risk of bias. We conducted meta\u2010analyses in clinically relevant groups using a random\u2010effects approach. We reported hazard ratios (HR), odds ratios (OR), and risk ratios (RR) separately for each available prognostic factor and outcome, stratified by different time points. Where possible, we meta\u2010analysed adjusted prognostic factors. We evaluated the certainty of the evidence with an adapted version of the GRADE framework. \u00a0    Main results We screened 6391 records. From these, we identified 59 studies (87 articles) as eligible for inclusion. Thirty\u2010five were prospective cohort studies, 22 were retrospective studies, 18 of which were cohort and six were based on data from electronic registers, and two were retrospective case\u2010control studies. Twenty\u2010three studies evaluated participants with type 1 diabetes (T1D), 19 with type 2 diabetes (T2D), and 17 included mixed populations (T1D and T2D). Studies on T1D included between 39 and 3250 participants at baseline, followed up for one to 45 years. Studies on T2D included between 100 and 71,817 participants at baseline, followed up for one to 20 years. The studies on mixed populations of T1D and T2D ranged from 76 to 32,553 participants at baseline, followed up for four to 25 years.\u00a0  We found evidence indicating that higher glycated haemoglobin (haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)) levels (adjusted OR ranged from 1.11 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 1.32) to 2.10 (95% CI 1.64 to 2.69) and more advanced stages of retinopathy (adjusted OR ranged from 1.38 (95% CI 1.29 to 1.48) to 12.40 (95% CI 5.31 to 28.98) are independent risk factors for the development of PDR in people with T1D and T2D. We rated the evidence for these factors as of moderate certainty because of moderate to high risk of bias in the studies.\u00a0  There was also some evidence suggesting several markers for renal disease (for example, nephropathy (adjusted OR ranged from 1.58 (95% CI not reported) to 2.68 (2.09 to 3.42), and creatinine (adjusted meta\u2010analysis HR 1.61 (95% CI 0.77 to 3.36)), and, in people with T1D, age at diagnosis of diabetes (< 12 years of age) (standardised regression estimate 1.62, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.48), increased triglyceride levels (adjusted RR 1.55, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.95), and larger retinal venular diameters (RR 4.28, 95% CI 1.50 to 12.19) may increase the risk of progression to PDR. The certainty of evidence for these factors, however, was low to very low, due to risk of bias in the included studies, inconsistency (lack of studies preventing the grading of consistency or variable outcomes), and imprecision (wide CIs). There was no substantial and consistent evidence to support duration of diabetes, systolic or diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, low\u2010 (LDL) and high\u2010 (HDL) density lipoproteins, gender, ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), socioeconomic status, or tobacco and alcohol consumption as being associated with incidence of PDR. There was insufficient evidence to evaluate prognostic factors associated with progression of PDR to HRC\u2010PDR.\u00a0    Authors' conclusions Increased HbA1c is likely to be associated with progression to PDR; therefore, maintaining adequate glucose control throughout life, irrespective of stage of DR severity, may help to prevent progression to PDR and risk of its sight\u2010threatening complications. Renal impairment in people with T1D or T2D, as well as younger age at diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (DM), increased triglyceride levels, and increased retinal venular diameters in people with T1D may also be associated with increased risk of progression to PDR. Given that more advanced DR severity is associated with higher risk of progression to PDR, the earlier the disease is identified, and the above systemic risk factors are controlled, the greater the chance of reducing the risk of PDR and saving sight.",

Any appropriate studies including a subset of relevant participants were considered as potentially eligible if data from this subset were given separately.",
        "Types of prognostic factors": "This review considered and included prognostic factor studies only. Specific prognostic factors of interest included, but were not restricted to: routinely collected patient demographics and information, such as age, gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and smoking habits;    frequently obtained standard clinical data, such as comorbidities (presence/absence of cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, nephropathy and specifically chronic kidney failure (defined as estimated GFR of < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2), peripheral neuropathy and specifically foot ulcers, amputation), BMI, neck/waist circumference, glycated haemoglobin, blood pressure, low\u2010density lipoprotein, high\u2010density lipoprotein, triglycerides; and    functional and structural retinal biomarkers in the prognostic context of the development and progression of PDR. routinely collected patient demographics and information, such as age, gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and smoking habits; frequently obtained standard clinical data, such as comorbidities (presence/absence of cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, nephropathy and specifically chronic kidney failure (defined as estimated GFR of < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2), peripheral neuropathy and specifically foot ulcers, amputation), BMI, neck/waist circumference, glycated haemoglobin, blood pressure, low\u2010density lipoprotein, high\u2010density lipoprotein, triglycerides; and functional and structural retinal biomarkers in the prognostic context of the development and progression of PDR. We excluded studies evaluating prognostic factors involving invasive procedures that cannot be practically undertaken in a clinical setting (such as aqueous/vitreous sampling) and are thus unlikely to be translatable to routine clinical practice. We expected that prognostic factors would generally have been measured at the time participants entered the studies, and indeed after diagnosis of DR or PDR. If measures of prognostic factors were available at other time points, and these coincided in more than one study, we planned to consider investigating them at these other time points.",
        "Types of outcomes to be predicted": "The development of PDR was determined by the presence of NVD or NVE, as diagnosed based on fundus examination, fundus photography, or fundus fluorescein angiography. We considered participants requiring laser treatment for PDR specifically to have progressed to the outcome of PDR. Progression from less than HRC\u2010PDR to HRC\u2010PDR. HRC\u2010PDR was defined according to the ETDRS as: i) NVD 0.5 disc area plus vitreous haemorrhage or pre\u2010retinal haemorrhage; ii) vitreous haemorrhage or pre\u2010retinal haemorrhage obscuring more than one disc area (Diabetic Retinopathy Study Research Group 1991). These features could have been determined by clinical examination or by the grading of ophthalmic images, both fundus photography and fundus fluorescein angiograms. Participants requiring laser treatment for HRC\u2010PDR specifically were considered as having progressed to the outcome of HRC\u2010PDR. The time horizon for the evaluation of health outcomes in this review was three years (\u00b1 two years), eight years (\u00b1 two years), or lifelong, if available. If not, we accepted and presented other time points.",

Study attrition   (a) Adequate response rate for study participants   Response rate (i.e., proportion of study sample completing the study and providing outcome data) is adequate      (b) Description of process for collecting information on participants who dropped out    Attempts to collect information on participants who dropped out are described (e.g. telephone contact, mail, registers)      (c) Reasons for loss to follow\u2010up provided   Reasons on participants who dropped out are reported     (d) Adequate description of participants lost to follow\u2010up   Key characteristics of participants lost to follow\u2010up are described     (e) No important differences between participants who completed the study and those who dropped out    Study authors described differences between participants completing the study and those who did not as not important or information provided to judge the differences      Domain overall risk of bias    High: most items are answered with 'no'; Low: all items answered with 'yes'; Moderate: most items are answered with 'unclear'      3. Prognostic factor measurement   (a) Clear definition of prognostic factor (PF) provided   Measurements for prognostic factors (PFs) are provided\u00a0     (b) Method of PF measurement is adequately valid and reliable   Measurements techniques for prognostic factors are described and likely to be valid and reliable, e.g., standardised, repeated      (c) Continuous variables are reported   Standard categories for prognostic factors / cut\u2010offs\u00a0     (d) Method and setting of measurement of PF is identical for all participants   Measurements of PFs are the same for all study participants     (e) Adequate proportion of study sample has complete data for PF   Adequate proportion of the study sample has complete data for PF variable     (f) Appropriate methods of imputation used for missing PF data   Appropriate methods of imputation are used for missing PF data     Domain overall risk of bias    High: most items are answered with 'no'; Low: all items answered with 'yes'; Moderate: most items are answered with 'unclear'      4. Outcome measurement   a) Clear definition of outcome provided\u00a0   Measurement of proliferative diabetic retinopathy(PDR)/high\u2010risk characteristics (HRC) is defined      (b) Method of outcome measurement is adequately valid and reliable   Measurement of PDR/HRC has to be a part of a diagnostic assessment     (c) Method and setting of outcome measurement is identical for all participants   Measurements of PDR/HRC are the same for all study participants     Domain overall risk of bias    High: most items are answered with 'no'; Low: all items answered with 'yes'; Moderate: most items are answered with 'unclear'      5. Adjustment for other prognostic factors   (a) All other important PFs measured   Important confounders are: HbA1c and duration of DM     b) Clear definitions of important PFs measured provided   Measurement of confounders has to be clearly described     (c) Measurement of all important PFs adequately valid and reliable   Measurement of confounders is valid and reliable     (d) Measurement and setting of PF measurement identical for all participants   Measurements of confounders are the same for all study participants     (e) Appropriate methods are used to deal with missing values of PFs   Strategy to impute missing confounder data is described     (f) Important PFs accounted for in study design   Methods section of the publication describes strategy to account for confounders     (g) Important PFs accounted for in analysis   Important confounders are accounted for in multivariable logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models      Domain overall risk of bias    High: most items are answered with 'no'; Low: all items answered with 'yes'; Moderate: most items are answered with 'unclear'      6. Statistical analysis and reporting   (a) Sufficient presentation of data to assess adequacy of analytic strategy   Mean or median values, including confidence intervals or standard errors or standard deviations provided      (b) Strategy for model building appropriate and based on a conceptual framework or model    The selected statistical model is adequate for the design of the study     (c) Selected statistical model adequate for design of study   Mainly incidence rates, uni\u2010 and multivariate logistic regression, Cox proportional hazard model      (d) No selective reporting of results   There is no selective reporting of results     Domain overall risk of bias    High: most items are answered with 'no'; Low: all items answered with 'yes'; Moderate: most items are answered with 'unclear'"
