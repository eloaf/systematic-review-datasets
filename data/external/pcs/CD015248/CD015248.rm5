Methods state that vertigo was summarised in 2 ways - severity (monthly total of counting vertigo scores) and frequency - the proportion of counting vertigo days per time period. However, monthly total scores are only reported for the whole group (i.e. the sum of episodes in the entire group), not for individual participants, therefore we are unable to ascertain the mean monthly severity score. It is unclear whether changes in the entire group are informative.</P></DESCRIPTION></QUALITY_ITEM_DATA_ENTRY><QUALITY_ITEM_DATA_ENTRY MODIFIED="2022-04-04 10:33:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="5B1A013182E26AA200AF683A366CF7F3" RESULT="UNKNOWN" STUDY_ID="STD-Gurkov-2012"><DESCRIPTION><P>Comment: no prospectively registered trial protocol was available to assess this domain. </P></DESCRIPTION></QUALITY_ITEM_DATA_ENTRY><QUALITY_ITEM_DATA_ENTRY MODIFIED="2022-04-04 11:09:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="5B1A013182E26AA200AF683A366CF7F3" RESULT="NO" STUDY_ID="STD-Russo-2017"><DESCRIPTION><P>Comment: data on severity of vertigo episodes were collected but are not reported.</P></DESCRIPTION></QUALITY_ITEM_DATA_ENTRY></QUALITY_ITEM_DATA></QUALITY_ITEM><QUALITY_ITEM CORE_ITEM="YES" ID="QIT-07" LEVEL="STUDY" MODIFIED="2022-09-27 09:42:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="8773" NO="7"><NAME>Other bias</NAME><DESCRIPTION><P>Bias due to problems not covered elsewhere in the table</P></DESCRIPTION><QUALITY_ITEM_DATA><QUALITY_ITEM_DATA_ENTRY MODIFIED="2022-03-09 13:24:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="5B1A013182E26AA200AF683A366CF7F3" RESULT="NO" STUDY_ID="STD-Gates-2004"><DESCRIPTION><P>Comment: change in vertigo is reported using an unvalidated scoring system. </P></DESCRIPTION></QUALITY_ITEM_DATA_ENTRY><QUALITY_ITEM_DATA_ENTRY MODIFIED="2022-04-04 10:33:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="5B1A013182E26AA200AF683A366CF7F3" RESULT="NO" STUDY_ID="STD-Gurkov-2012"><DESCRIPTION><P>Comment: the use of a placebo device that generated a small pressure may have caused bias in the overall estimated effect.
