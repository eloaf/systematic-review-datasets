    "title": "Systemic opioid regimens for postoperative pain in neonates",
    "abstract": "Background Postoperative pain clinical management in neonates has always been a challenging medical issue. Worldwide, several systemic opioid regimens are available for pediatricians, neonatologists, and general practitioners to control pain in neonates undergoing surgical procedures. However, the most effective and safe regimen is still unknown in the current body of literature.    Objectives To determine the effects of different regimens of systemic opioid analgesics in neonates submitted to surgery on all\u2010cause mortality, pain, and significant neurodevelopmental disability. Potentially assessed regimens might include: different doses of the same opioid, different routes of administration of the same opioid, continuous infusion versus bolus administration, or 'as needed' administration versus 'as scheduled' administration.    Search methods Searches were conducted in June 2022 using the following databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials [CENTRAL], PubMed, and CINAHL. Trial registration records were identified via CENTRAL and an independent search of the ISRCTN registry.    Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi\u2010randomized, cluster\u2010randomized, and cross\u2010over controlled trials evaluating systemic opioid regimens' effects on postoperative pain in neonates (pre\u2010term or full\u2010term). We considered suitable for inclusion: I) studies evaluating different doses of the same opioid; 2) studies evaluating different routes of administration of the same opioid; 3) studies evaluating the effectiveness of continuous infusion versus bolus infusion; and 4) studies establishing an assessment of an 'as needed' administration versus 'as scheduled' administration.    Data collection and analysis According to Cochrane methods, two investigators independently screened retrieved records, extracted data, and appraised the risk of bias. We stratified meta\u2010analysis by the type of intervention: studies evaluating the use of opioids for postoperative pain in neonates through continuous infusion versus bolus infusion and studies assessing the 'as needed' administration versus 'as scheduled' administration. We used the fixed\u2010effect model with risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous data and mean difference (MD), standardized mean difference (SMD), median, and interquartile range (IQR) for continuous data. Finally, we used the GRADEpro approach for primary outcomes to evaluate the quality of the evidence across included studies.    Main results In this review, we included seven randomized controlled clinical trials (504 infants) from 1996 to 2020. We identified no studies comparing different doses of the same opioid, or different routes. The administration of continuous opioid infusion versus bolus administration of opioids was evaluated in six studies, while one study compared 'as needed' versus 'as scheduled' administration of morphine given by parents or nurses. Overall, the effectiveness of continuous infusion of opioids over bolus infusion as measured by the visual analog scale (MD 0.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) \u20100.23 to 0.23; 133 participants, 2 studies; I\u00b2 = 0); or using the COMFORT scale (MD \u20100.07, 95% CI \u20100.89 to 0.75; 133 participants, 2 studies; I\u00b2 = 0), remains unclear due to study designs' limitations, such as the unclear risk of attrition, reporting bias, and imprecision among reported results (very low certainty of the evidence). \u00a0None of the included studies reported data on other clinically important outcomes such as all\u2010cause mortality rate during hospitalization, major neurodevelopmental disability, the incidence of severe retinopathy of prematurity or intraventricular hemorrhage, and cognitive\u2010 and educational\u2010related outcomes.\u00a0    Authors' conclusions Limited evidence is available on continuous infusion compared to intermittent boluses of systemic opioids. We are uncertain whether continuous opioid infusion reduces pain compared with intermittent opioid boluses; none of the studies reported the other primary outcomes of this review, i.e. all\u2010cause mortality during initial hospitalization, significant neurodevelopmental disability, or cognitive and educational outcomes among children older than five years old. Only one small study reported on morphine infusion with parent\u2010 or nurse\u2010controlled analgesia.",

We excluded: infants receiving opioids during mechanical ventilation for respiratory morbidity;   infants receiving opioids pre\u2010intubation;   infants receiving opioids for procedural pain;   infants treated for neonatal abstinence syndrome; and   infants undergoing hemodialysis. infants receiving opioids during mechanical ventilation for respiratory morbidity; infants receiving opioids pre\u2010intubation; infants receiving opioids for procedural pain; infants treated for neonatal abstinence syndrome; and infants undergoing hemodialysis.",
        "Types of interventions": "We included studies on any opioids (e.g. morphine, diamorphine, fentanyl, alfentanil, sufentanil, pethidine, meperidine, codeine) following neonatal surgery. The following acceptable comparisons were included. Comparison 1: different doses of the same opioid   Comparison 2: different routes of administration of the same opioid (e.g. enteral versus parenteral)    Comparison 3: continuous infusion versus bolus administration of the same opioid   Comparison 4: 'as needed' administration (e.g. based on pain scales) versus 'as scheduled' administration of the same opioid (e.g. a predefined time interval) Comparison 1: different doses of the same opioid Comparison 2: different routes of administration of the same opioid (e.g. enteral versus parenteral) Comparison 3: continuous infusion versus bolus administration of the same opioid Comparison 4: 'as needed' administration (e.g. based on pain scales) versus 'as scheduled' administration of the same opioid (e.g. a predefined time interval) We included any systemic route of administration (e.g. enteral and intravenous). We excluded spinal administration (i.e. intrathecal, epidural, caudal), intraosseous infusion, nerve blocks or wound infusions. We included studies where the interventions were started during surgery, if their administration was continued postoperatively. Studies comparing opioids to other interventions were included in the ongoing Cochrane Review, 'Systemic opioids versus other analgesics and sedatives for postoperative pain in neonates' (Kinoshita 2021).",

        "Appendix 2. Risk of bias tool": "We used the standard methods of Cochrane and Cochrane Neonatal to assess the methodological quality of the trials. For each trial, we sought information regarding the method of randomization, blinding, and reporting of all outcomes of all the infants enrolled in the trial. We assessed each criterion as being at a low, high, or unclear risk of bias. Two review authors separately assessed each study. We resolved any disagreements by discussion. We added this information to the 'Characteristics of included studies' table. We evaluated the following issues and entered the findings into the Risk of bias table.   1. Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias). Was the allocation sequence adequately generated?  For each included study, we will categorize the method used to generate the allocation sequence as:     low risk (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);    high risk (any non\u2010random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number); or    unclear risk.      2. Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias). Was allocation adequately concealed?  For each included study, we will categorize the method used to conceal the allocation sequence as:     low risk (e.g. telephone or central randomization; consecutively numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes);    high risk (open random allocation; unsealed or non\u2010opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth); or    unclear risk      3. Blinding of participants and personnel (checking for possible performance bias). Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study?  For each included study, we will categorize the methods used to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We will assess blinding separately for different outcomes or class of outcomes. We will categorize the methods as:     low risk, high risk, or unclear risk for participants; and   low risk, high risk, or unclear risk for personnel.      4. Blinding of outcome assessment (checking for possible detection bias). Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented at the time of outcome assessment?  For each included study, we will categorize the methods used to blind outcome assessment. We will assess blinding separately for different outcomes or class of outcomes. We will categorize the methods as:     low risk for outcome assessors;   high risk for outcome assessors; or   unclear risk for outcome assessors.      5. Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations). Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed?  For each included study and for each outcome, we will describe the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We will note whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomized participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information is reported or supplied by the trial authors, we will re\u2010include missing data in the analyses. We will categorize the methods as:     low risk (< 20% missing data);   high risk (\u2265 20% missing data); or   unclear risk.      6. Selective reporting bias. Are reports of the study free of the suggestion of selective outcome reporting?  For each included study, we will describe how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. For studies in which study protocols were published in advance, we will compare prespecified outcomes versus outcomes eventually reported in the published results. If the study protocol was not published in advance, we will contact study authors to gain access to the study protocol. We will assess the methods as:     low risk (where it is clear that all of the study's prespecified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);    high risk (where not all the study's prespecified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not prespecified outcomes of interest and are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; the study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported); or    unclear risk.      7. Other sources of bias. Was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at high risk of bias?  For each included study, we will describe any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias (e.g. whether there was a potential source of bias related to the specific study design or whether the trial was stopped early due to some data\u2010dependent process). We will assess whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as:     low risk;   high risk;   unclear risk.    If needed, we plan to explore the impact of the level of bias by undertaking sensitivity analyses.",

We will assess the methods as:     low risk (where it is clear that all of the study's prespecified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);    high risk (where not all the study's prespecified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not prespecified outcomes of interest and are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; the study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported); or    unclear risk.",
        "7. Other sources of bias. Was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at high risk of bias?": "For each included study, we will describe any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias (e.g. whether there was a potential source of bias related to the specific study design or whether the trial was stopped early due to some data\u2010dependent process). We will assess whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as:     low risk;   high risk;   unclear risk.    If needed, we plan to explore the impact of the level of bias by undertaking sensitivity analyses."
