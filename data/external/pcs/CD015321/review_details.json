    "title": "Non\u2010pharmacological interventions for prophylaxis of vestibular migraine",
    "abstract": "Background Vestibular migraine is a form of migraine where one of the main features is recurrent attacks of vertigo. These episodes are often associated with other features of migraine, including headache and sensitivity to light or sound. These unpredictable and severe attacks of vertigo can lead to a considerable reduction in quality of life. The condition is estimated to affect just under 1% of the population, although many people remain undiagnosed. A number of interventions have been used, or proposed to be used, as prophylaxis for this condition, to help reduce the frequency of the attacks. Many of these interventions include dietary, lifestyle or behavioural changes, rather than medication.\u00a0    Objectives To assess the benefits and harms of non\u2010pharmacological treatments used for prophylaxis of vestibular migraine.    Search methods The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 23 September 2022.    Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi\u2010RCTs in adults with definite or probable vestibular migraine comparing dietary modifications, sleep improvement techniques, vitamin and mineral supplements, herbal supplements, talking therapies, mind\u2010body interventions or vestibular rehabilitation with either placebo or no treatment. We excluded studies with a cross\u2010over design, unless data from the first phase of the study could be identified.\u00a0    Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were: 1) improvement in vertigo (assessed as a dichotomous outcome \u2010 improved or not improved), 2) change in vertigo (assessed as a continuous outcome, with a score on a numerical scale) and 3) serious adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were: 4) disease\u2010specific health\u2010related quality of life, 5) improvement in headache, 6) improvement in other migrainous symptoms and 7) other adverse effects. We considered outcomes reported at three time points: < 3 months, 3 to < 6 months, > 6 to 12 months. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.\u00a0    Main results We included three studies in this review with a total of 319 participants. Each study addressed a different comparison and these are outlined below. We did not identify any evidence for the remaining comparisons of interest in this review. \u00a0  Dietary interventions (probiotics) versus placebo   We identified one study with 218 participants (85% female). The use of a probiotic supplement was compared to a placebo and participants were followed up for two years. Some data were reported on the change in vertigo frequency and severity over the duration of the study. However, there were no data regarding improvement of vertigo or serious adverse events.  Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) versus no intervention   One study compared CBT to no treatment in 61 participants (72% female). Participants were followed up for eight weeks. Data were reported on the change in vertigo over the course of the study, but no information was reported on the proportion of people whose vertigo improved, or on the occurrence of serious adverse events.\u00a0  Vestibular rehabilitation versus no intervention   The third study compared the use of vestibular rehabilitation to no treatment in a group of 40 participants (90% female) and participants were followed up for six months. Again, this study reported some data on change in the frequency of vertigo during the study, but no information on the proportion of participants who experienced an improvement in vertigo or the number who experienced serious adverse events.\u00a0  We are unable to draw meaningful conclusions from the numerical results of these studies, as the data for each comparison of interest come from single, small studies and the certainty of the evidence was low or very low.\u00a0    Authors' conclusions There is a paucity of evidence for non\u2010pharmacological interventions that may be used for prophylaxis of vestibular migraine. Only a limited number of interventions have been assessed by comparing them to no intervention or a placebo treatment, and the evidence from these studies is all of low or very low certainty. We are therefore unsure whether any of these interventions may be effective at reducing the symptoms of vestibular migraine and we are also unsure whether they have the potential to cause harm.",

        "Types of studies": "We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi\u2010randomised trials (where trials were designed as RCTs, but the sequence generation for allocation of treatment used methods such as alternate allocation, birth dates etc). The number of episodes of vestibular migraine may vary with time \u2010 patients sometimes have periods of more active disease, followed by a period of fewer attacks. Therefore cross\u2010over trials are not an appropriate study design when assessing prophylaxis for this condition. Cross\u2010over RCTs would only have been included if data could be extracted for the first phase of the study. If cluster\u2010RCTs were identified then they would have been eligible for inclusion, providing we could appropriately account for the clustering in the data analysis (according to methods described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions)\u00a0(Handbook 2021). However, we did not identify any cross\u2010over or cluster\u2010randomised trials for this review.",
        "Types of participants": "We included studies that recruited participants with a diagnosis of vestibular migraine, according to the International Headache Society (IHS) and B\u00e1r\u00e1ny Society criteria (see\u00a0Appendix 1). We also included studies that used other, established criteria, for example\u00a0Neuhauser 2001\u00a0(Appendix 2). We included studies where participants were diagnosed with either 'definite' vestibular migraine or 'probable' vestibular migraine. Where studies recruited participants with a variety of diagnoses (e.g. vestibular migraine and classical migraine) we planned to include the study if either the majority of participants (\u2265 90%) had a diagnosis of vestibular migraine; or   subgroup data were available that allowed us to identify data specifically from those with vestibular migraine. the majority of participants (\u2265 90%) had a diagnosis of vestibular migraine; or subgroup data were available that allowed us to identify data specifically from those with vestibular migraine. However, we did not identify any trials that included participants with classical migraine.",
        "Types of interventions": "We included the following interventions: dietary modification (including elimination of food triggers such as alcohol, caffeine or other foods, salt restriction, altered timing of meals);    sleep improvement techniques (to ensure regular sleep patterns);   vitamin and mineral supplements;   herbal supplements (e.g. St John's Wort, feverfew);   talking therapies (such as counselling or CBT);   mind\u2010body interventions (e.g. meditation or mindfulness, yoga, T'ai Chi);   vestibular rehabilitation. dietary modification (including elimination of food triggers such as alcohol, caffeine or other foods, salt restriction, altered timing of meals); sleep improvement techniques (to ensure regular sleep patterns); vitamin and mineral supplements; herbal supplements (e.g. St John's Wort, feverfew); talking therapies (such as counselling or CBT); mind\u2010body interventions (e.g. meditation or mindfulness, yoga, T'ai Chi); vestibular rehabilitation. We excluded interventions from alternative medical systems (e.g. Ayurvedic medicines or traditional Chinese medicines) and energy therapies (e.g. acupuncture, acupressure and magnetic therapy). We used the system developed by Wieland et al to classify complementary and alternative medicines and identify whether they will be included/excluded from the review (Wieland 2011). The main comparisons were planned to be: dietary modification versus no intervention/placebo;   sleep improvement techniques versus no intervention/placebo;   vitamin and mineral supplements versus no intervention/placebo;   herbal supplements versus no intervention/placebo;   talking therapies versus no intervention/placebo;   mind\u2010body interventions versus no intervention/placebo;   vestibular rehabilitation versus no intervention/placebo. dietary modification versus no intervention/placebo; sleep improvement techniques versus no intervention/placebo; vitamin and mineral supplements versus no intervention/placebo; herbal supplements versus no intervention/placebo; talking therapies versus no intervention/placebo; mind\u2010body interventions versus no intervention/placebo; vestibular rehabilitation versus no intervention/placebo. There were no limits on the type of concurrent treatments used, providing these were used equally in each arm of the study. We planned to pool studies that included concurrent treatments with those where participants did not receive concurrent treatment, and to conduct subgroup analysis to determine whether the effect estimates may be different in those receiving additional treatment.",
        "Concurrent treatments": "There were no limits on the type of concurrent treatments used, providing these were used equally in each arm of the study.

        "Types of outcome measures": "We assessed outcomes at the following time points: < 3 months;   3 to 6 months;   > 6 to 12 months. < 3 months; 3 to 6 months; > 6 to 12 months. The exception was for adverse event data, when we used the longest time period of follow\u2010up. We searched the COMET database for existing core outcome sets of relevance to vestibular migraine and vertigo, but were unable to find any published core outcome sets. We therefore conducted a survey of individuals with experience of (or an interest in) balance disorders to help identify outcomes that should be prioritised. The results of this survey were used by the review author team to inform the choice of outcome measures in this review. We analysed the following outcomes in the review, but we did not use them as a basis for including or excluding studies. Improvement in vertigo   Measured as a dichotomous outcome (improved/not improved), according to self\u2010report, or according to a change of a specified score (as described by the study authors) on a vertigo rating scale.      Change in vertigo   Measured as a continuous outcome, to identify the extent of change in vertigo symptoms.     Serious adverse events   Including any event that caused death, was life\u2010threatening, required hospitalisation, resulted in disability or permanent damage, or in congenital abnormality. Measured as the number of participants who experienced at least one serious adverse event during the follow\u2010up period.

Serious adverse events Including any event that caused death, was life\u2010threatening, required hospitalisation, resulted in disability or permanent damage, or in congenital abnormality. Measured as the number of participants who experienced at least one serious adverse event during the follow\u2010up period. Vertigo symptoms comprise a variety of different features, including frequency of episodes, duration of episodes and severity/intensity of the episodes. Where possible, we included data for the vertigo outcomes that encompass all of these three aspects (frequency, duration and severity/intensity of symptoms). However, we anticipated that these data may not be available from all studies. If they were unavailable, then we extracted data on the frequency of vertigo episodes as an alternative measure for these outcomes.

It includes a set of predefined criteria to select studies that, based on available information, are deemed to be sufficiently trustworthy to be included in the analysis. These criteria are:  Research governance     Are there any retraction notices or expressions of concern listed on the Retraction Watch Database relating to this study?    Was the study prospectively registered (for those studies published after 2010)? If not, was there a plausible reason?    When requested, did the trial authors provide/share the protocol and/or ethics approval letter?    Did the trial authors engage in communication with the Cochrane Review authors within the agreed timelines?    Did the trial authors provide IPD data upon request? If not, was there a plausible reason?     Baseline characteristics     Is the study free from characteristics of the study participants that appear too similar (e.g. distribution of the mean (SD) excessively narrow or excessively wide, as noted by\u00a0Carlisle 2017)?     Feasibility     Is the study free from characteristics that could be implausible? (e.g. large numbers of women with a rare condition (such as severe cholestasis in pregnancy) recruited within 12 months);    In cases with (close to) zero losses to follow\u2010up, is there a plausible explanation?    Results     Is the study free from results that could be implausible? (e.g. massive risk reduction for main outcomes with small sample size)?    Do the numbers randomised to each group suggest that adequate randomisation methods were used (e.g. is the study free from issues such as unexpectedly even numbers of women \u2018randomised\u2019 including a mismatch between the numbers and the methods, if the authors say \u2018no blocking was used\u2019 but still end up with equal numbers, or if the authors say they used \u2018blocks of 4\u2019 but the final numbers differ by 6)?     Studies assessed as being potentially \u2018high risk\u2019 will be not be included in the review. Where a study is classified as \u2018high risk\u2019 for one or more of the above criteria we will attempt to contact the study authors to address any possible lack of information/concerns. If adequate information remains unavailable, the study will remain in \u2018awaiting classification\u2019 and the reasons and communications with the author (or lack of) described in detail.
