    "title": "Pharmacological interventions for persistent postural\u2010perceptual dizziness (PPPD)",
    "abstract": "Background Persistent postural\u2010perceptual dizziness (PPPD) is a chronic balance disorder, which is characterised by subjective unsteadiness or dizziness that is worse on standing and with visual stimulation. The condition was only recently defined and therefore the prevalence is currently unknown. However, it is likely to include a considerable number of people with chronic balance problems. The symptoms can be debilitating and have a profound impact on quality of life. At present, little is known about the optimal way to treat this condition. A variety of medications may be used, as well as other treatments, such as vestibular rehabilitation.\u00a0    Objectives To evaluate the benefits and harms of pharmacological interventions for persistent postural\u2010perceptual dizziness (PPPD).\u00a0    Search methods The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 21 November 2022.    Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi\u2010RCTs in adults with PPPD, which compared selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) with either placebo or no treatment. We excluded studies that did not use the B\u00e1r\u00e1ny Society criteria to diagnose PPPD and studies that followed up participants for less than three months.\u00a0    Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were: 1) improvement in vestibular symptoms (assessed as a dichotomous outcome \u2010 improved or not improved), 2) change in vestibular symptoms (assessed as a continuous outcome, with a score on a numerical scale) and 3) serious adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were: 4) disease\u2010specific health\u2010related quality of life, 5) generic health\u2010related quality of life and 6) other adverse effects. We considered outcomes reported at three time points: 3 to < 6 months, 6 to \u2264 12 months and > 12 months. We planned to use GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.\u00a0    Main results We identified no studies that met our inclusion criteria.   Authors' conclusions At present, there is no evidence from placebo\u2010controlled randomised trials regarding pharmacological treatments \u2010 specifically SSRIs and SNRIs \u2010 for PPPD. Consequently, there is great uncertainty over the use of these treatments for this condition. Further work is needed to establish whether any treatments are effective at improving the symptoms of PPPD, and whether their use is associated with any adverse effects.",

        "Types of studies": "We planned to include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi\u2010randomised trials (where trials were designed as RCTs, but the sequence generation for allocation of treatment used methods such as alternate allocation, birth dates etc). We also intended to include cross\u2010over trials and cluster\u2010randomised trials, if we could correctly account for the correlation in the data. For studies to obtain accurate estimates of the effect of different interventions, we considered that follow\u2010up of participants should be for at least three months, as the medications may take some time to take effect, and this is a chronic illness, where short\u2010term follow\u2010up may not accurately represent the longer\u2010term outcome for patients. Studies that followed up participants for less than three months were excluded from the review.",
        "Types of participants": "We included studies that recruited adult participants (aged 18 years or older) with a diagnosis of PPPD, according to the B\u00e1r\u00e1ny Society criteria (see\u00a0Appendix 1). We excluded from the review studies that used alternative definitions of functional dizziness syndromes, such as chronic subjective dizziness (CSD), visual vertigo, space\u2010motion discomfort or phobic postural vertigo. Although we recognise that the symptoms of PPPD overlap considerably with some features of these disorders, we aimed to focus the results of the review so that they are directly relevant to those who are diagnosed with this (recently characterised) condition.",
        "Types of interventions": "We included the following interventions: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs);   serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). The main comparison was: SSRIs and SNRIs versus placebo/no treatment. SSRIs and SNRIs versus placebo/no treatment.",
        "Types of outcome measures": "We planned to assess outcomes at the following time points: 3 to < 6 months;   6 to \u2264 12 months;   > 12 months. 3 to < 6 months; 6 to \u2264 12 months; > 12 months. The exception was for adverse event data, when we planned to use the longest time period of follow\u2010up. We searched the COMET database for existing core outcome sets of relevance to PPPD and vertigo, but were unable to find any published core outcome sets. We therefore conducted a survey of individuals with experience of (or an interest in) balance disorders to help identify outcomes that should be prioritised. This online survey was conducted with the support of the M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's Society and the Migraine Trust, and included 324 participants, who provided information regarding priority outcomes. The review author team used the results of this survey to inform the choice of outcome measures in this review. We planned to analyse the following outcomes in the review, but we did not use them as a basis for including or excluding studies. Improvement in vestibular symptoms   Measured as a dichotomous outcome (improved/not improved), according to self\u2010report, or according to a change of a specified score (as described by the study authors) on a rating scale.      Change in vestibular symptoms   Measured as a continuous outcome, to identify the extent of change in vestibular symptoms.     Serious adverse events   Including any event that caused death, was life\u2010threatening, required hospitalisation, resulted in disability or permanent damage, or in congenital abnormality. Measured as the number of participants who experienced at least one serious adverse event during the follow\u2010up period.

        "Appendix 1. Diagnostic criteria for PPPD": "The B\u00e1r\u00e1ny Society criteria for PPPD (Staab 2017):     One or more symptoms of dizziness, unsteadiness or non\u2010spinning vertigo, present on most days for three months or more:    symptoms are persistent, but wax and wane;   symptoms tend to increase as the day progresses, but may not be active throughout the entire day;    momentary flares may occur spontaneously or with sudden movements.     Symptoms are present without specific provocation, but are exacerbated by:   upright posture;   active or passive motion without regard to direction or position; and   exposure to moving visual stimuli or complex visual patterns, although these three features may not be equally provocative.      The disorder usually begins shortly after an event that causes acute vestibular symptoms or problems with balance, though less commonly it develops slowly. Precipitating events include acute, episodic or chronic vestibular syndromes, other neurologic or medical illness, and psychological distress.    When triggered by an acute or episodic precipitant, symptoms typically settle into the pattern of criterion 1 as the precipitant resolves, but may occur intermittently at first, and then consolidate into a persistent course.    When triggered by a chronic precipitant, symptoms may develop slowly and worsen gradually.     Symptoms cause significant distress or functional impairment.   Symptoms are not better attributed to another disease or disorder.",
        "Appendix 2. Trustworthiness Screening Tool": "This screening tool has been developed by Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth. It includes a set of predefined criteria to select studies that, based on available information, are deemed to be sufficiently trustworthy to be included in the analysis. These criteria are:  Research governance     Are there any retraction notices or expressions of concern listed on the Retraction Watch Database relating to this study?    Was the study prospectively registered (for those studies published after 2010)? If not, was there a plausible reason?    When requested, did the trial authors provide/share the protocol and/or ethics approval letter?    Did the trial authors engage in communication with the Cochrane Review authors within the agreed timelines?    Did the trial authors provide IPD data upon request? If not, was there a plausible reason?     Baseline characteristics     Is the study free from characteristics of the study participants that appear too similar (e.g. distribution of the mean (SD) excessively narrow or excessively wide, as noted by\u00a0Carlisle 2017)?     Feasibility     Is the study free from characteristics that could be implausible? (e.g. large numbers of women with a rare condition (such as severe cholestasis in pregnancy) recruited within 12 months);    In cases with (close to) zero losses to follow\u2010up, is there a plausible explanation?    Results     Is the study free from results that could be implausible? (e.g. massive risk reduction for main outcomes with small sample size)?    Do the numbers randomised to each group suggest that adequate randomisation methods were used (e.g. is the study free from issues such as unexpectedly even numbers of women \u2018randomised\u2019 including a mismatch between the numbers and the methods, if the authors say \u2018no blocking was used\u2019 but still end up with equal numbers, or if the authors say they used \u2018blocks of 4\u2019 but the final numbers differ by 6)?     Studies assessed as being potentially \u2018high risk\u2019 will be not be included in the review. Where a study is classified as \u2018high risk\u2019 for one or more of the above criteria we will attempt to contact the study authors to address any possible lack of information/concerns. If adequate information remains unavailable, the study will remain in \u2018awaiting classification\u2019 and the reasons and communications with the author (or lack of) described in detail.  The process is described in full in Figure 2.",
