    "title": "Consumers\u2019 and health providers\u2019 views and perceptions of partnering to improve health services design, delivery and evaluation: a co\u2010produced qualitative evidence synthesis",
    "abstract": "Background Partnering with consumers in the planning, delivery and evaluation of health services is an essential component of person\u2010centred care. There are many ways to partner with consumers to improve health services, including formal group partnerships (such as committees, boards or steering groups). However, consumers' and health providers' views and experiences of formal group partnerships remain unclear.  In this qualitative evidence synthesis (QES), we focus specifically on formal group partnerships where health providers and consumers share decision\u2010making about planning, delivering and/or evaluating health services. Formal group partnerships were selected because they are widely used throughout the world to improve person\u2010centred care.  For the purposes of this QES, the term 'consumer' refers to a person who is a patient, carer or community member who brings their perspective to health service partnerships. 'Health provider' refers to a person with a health policy, management, administrative or clinical role who participates in formal partnerships in an advisory or representative capacity.  This QES was co\u2010produced with a Stakeholder Panel of consumers and health providers. The QES was undertaken concurrently with a Cochrane intervention review entitled Effects of consumers and health providers working in partnership on health services planning, delivery and evaluation.    Objectives 1. To synthesise the views and experiences of consumers and health providers of formal partnership approaches that aimed to improve planning, delivery or evaluation of health services.  2. To identify best practice principles for formal partnership approaches in health services by understanding consumers' and health providers' views and experiences.    Search methods We searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and CINAHL for studies published between January 2000 and October 2018. We also searched grey literature sources including websites of relevant research and policy organisations involved in promoting person\u2010centred care.    Selection criteria We included qualitative studies that explored consumers' and health providers' perceptions and experiences of partnering in formal group formats to improve the planning, delivery or evaluation of health services.    Data collection and analysis Following completion of abstract and full\u2010text screening, we used purposive sampling to select a sample of eligible studies that covered a range of pre\u2010defined criteria, including rich data, range of countries and country income level, settings, participants, and types of partnership activities. A Framework Synthesis approach was used to synthesise the findings of the sample. We appraised the quality of each study using the CASP (Critical Appraisal Skill Program) tool. We assessed our confidence in the findings using the GRADE\u2010CERQual (Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research) approach.  The Stakeholder Panel was involved in each stage of the review from development of the protocol to development of the best practice principles.    Main results We found 182 studies that were eligible for inclusion. From this group, we selected 33 studies to include in the final synthesis. These studies came from a wide range of countries including 28 from high\u2010income countries and five from low\u2010 or middle\u2010income countries (LMICs).  Each of the studies included the experiences and views of consumers and/or health providers of partnering in formal group formats. The results were divided into the following categories.  Contextual factors influencing partnerships: government policy, policy implementation processes and funding, as well as the organisational context of the health service, could facilitate or impede partnering (moderate level of confidence).  Consumer recruitment: consumer recruitment occurred in different ways and consumers managed the recruitment process in a minority of studies only (high level of confidence). Recruiting a range of consumers who were reflective of the clinic's demographic population was considered desirable, particularly by health providers (high level of confidence). Some health providers perceived that individual consumers' experiences were not generalisable to the broader population whereas consumers perceived it could be problematic to aim to represent a broad range of community views (high level of confidence).  Partnership dynamics and processes: positive interpersonal dynamics between health providers and consumers facilitated partnerships (high level of confidence). However, formal meeting formats and lack of clarity about the consumer role could constrain consumers\u2019 involvement (high level of confidence). Health providers\u2019 professional status, technical knowledge and use of jargon were intimidating for some consumers (high level of confidence) and consumers could feel their experiential knowledge was not valued (moderate level of confidence). Consumers could also become frustrated when health providers dominated the meeting agenda (moderate level of confidence) and when they experienced token involvement, such as a lack of decision\u2010making power (high level of confidence)  Perceived impacts on partnership participants: partnering could affect health provider and consumer participants in both positive and negative ways (high level of confidence).  Perceived impacts on health service planning, delivery and evaluation: partnering was perceived to improve the person\u2010centredness of health service culture (high level of confidence), improve the built environment of the health service (high level of confidence), improve health service design and delivery e.g. facilitate 'out of hours' services or treatment closer to home (high level of confidence), enhance community ownership of health services, particularly in LMICs (moderate level of confidence), and improve consumer involvement in strategic decision\u2010making, under certain conditions (moderate level of confidence). There was limited evidence suggesting partnering may improve health service evaluation (very low level of confidence).  Best practice principles for formal partnering to promote person\u2010centred care were developed from these findings. The principles were developed collaboratively with the Stakeholder Panel and included leadership and health service culture; diversity; equity; mutual respect; shared vision and regular communication; shared agendas and decision\u2010making; influence and sustainability.    Authors' conclusions Successful formal group partnerships with consumers require health providers to continually reflect and address power imbalances that may constrain consumers' participation. Such imbalances may be particularly acute in recruitment procedures, meeting structure and content and decision\u2010making processes. Formal group partnerships were perceived to improve the physical environment of health services, the person\u2010centredness of health service culture and health service design and delivery. Implementing the best practice principles may help to address power imbalances, strengthen formal partnering, improve the experiences of consumers and health providers and positively affect partnership outcomes.",

        "Types of phenomena of interest": "We included qualitative studies that focused on working in formal group partnerships to improve planning, delivery or evaluation of health services. Partnering is defined as \"healthcare organisations, healthcare providers and policymakers actively working with people who use the healthcare system to ensure that health information and services meet people's needs\" (ACSQHC 2018). For the purposes of this review, formal group partnerships were operationalised as consumers and health providers meeting jointly and regularly in formal group formats (e.g. committees, councils, working groups) to share decision\u2010making for the purpose of planning, delivery or evaluation in one or more health service(s). Studies meeting the following criteria were eligible for inclusion. Consumers and health providers were engaged in formal group formats, such as committees, councils, boards or steering groups.    The group involved at least one consumer and at least one health provider.   The group met jointly, more than once via face\u2010to\u2010face or electronic modes.   The group was either ongoing or time\u2010limited (for example, groups formed for a specific project).    The group made joint decisions for planning and/or delivery and/or evaluation of health services. Consumers and health providers were engaged in formal group formats, such as committees, councils, boards or steering groups. The group involved at least one consumer and at least one health provider. The group met jointly, more than once via face\u2010to\u2010face or electronic modes. The group was either ongoing or time\u2010limited (for example, groups formed for a specific project). The group made joint decisions for planning and/or delivery and/or evaluation of health services. We excluded studies that involved partnering with consumers for decision\u2010making about an individual's care or treatment, and studies focused on partnering with consumers for health services research (planning, undertaking, or disseminating research), including a health service's management of research (research funding panels, setting research priorities, research ethics, and governance). We included studies which involved partnering with consumers for health provider education, but only when these partnerships included formal group formats (e.g. a training committee or delivering joint training).",
        "Types of studies": "This review included primary, empirical qualitative studies that included a description of the sampling strategy, data collection procedures and the type of data analysis undertaken (Hannes 2011). We also included the qualitative component of mixed methods studies. We excluded opinion pieces, vignettes and editorials.",
        "Types of settings": "The setting for outcomes of the partnering approaches was health services. For the purposes of this review, health services were defined as healthcare organisations that provided direct care to patients in primary settings (e.g. community health centre, general practitioner practice), secondary settings (e.g. specialist outpatient clinics), or tertiary settings (e.g. hospitals). We also included home and residential services but only when the primary focus was on providing health or nursing care (e.g. home\u2010based nursing services, nursing homes, residential rehabilitation services or hospices). Studies from rural and urban settings were eligible for inclusion, as well as those from high\u2010income and low\u2010 and middle\u2010income countries.",
        "Types of participants": "For the purposes of the QES, the terms 'consumer' and 'health provider' were defined as follows. 'Consumer' referred to a person who was a patient, carer or community member who brought their perspective to health service partnerships. The term also included consultants who were employed by the health service to represent the patient or carer perspective.    'Health provider' referred to a person who had a health policy, management, administrative, or clinical role and who participated in formal partnerships in an advisory or representative capacity. A health provider did not include a person whose primary role was a health researcher. 'Consumer' referred to a person who was a patient, carer or community member who brought their perspective to health service partnerships. The term also included consultants who were employed by the health service to represent the patient or carer perspective. 'Health provider' referred to a person who had a health policy, management, administrative, or clinical role and who participated in formal partnerships in an advisory or representative capacity. A health provider did not include a person whose primary role was a health researcher. We excluded health provider participants who assumed the role of consumers in a partnership, as their primary role was to represent providers rather than consumers. We analysed data from consumer and health provider participants separately, when possible. We included the findings of studies when the views of consumers or health providers were combined, as long as the findings addressed the objectives of this review. We also included data where consumer or health provider views were combined with other types of participants (e.g. community development officers). However, when analysed separately, we did not include the views of other types of participants.",
        "Search methods for identification of studies": "We searched the following databases on 3 October 2018: MEDLINE (OvidSP) (1946 to 2 October 2018).   Embase (OvidSP) (1947 to 2 October 2018).   PsycINFO (OvidSP) (1806 to 2 October 2018).   CINAHL (EBSCO) (1937 to 2 October 2018). MEDLINE (OvidSP) (1946 to 2 October 2018). Embase (OvidSP) (1947 to 2 October 2018). PsycINFO (OvidSP) (1806 to 2 October 2018). CINAHL (EBSCO) (1937 to 2 October 2018). Consistent with a qualitative paradigm, a purposive sampling approach was used to develop the search strategy, rather than an exhaustive and comprehensive approach (Noyes 2022). Informal scoping searches of our topic in MEDLINE showed a proliferation of studies about partnering with consumers published after 2000. Our search results were therefore limited by publication date and we considered studies published from January 2000. We also restricted the search to English language studies only due to the challenges associated with translating qualitative research articles, and a lack of translating expertise within the author team (i.e. no two members of the research team spoke the same language other than English). This decision was informed by the language restrictions used in a previous Cochrane QES (see\u00a0Ames 2017). There were no geographic restrictions. We present the search strategies in\u00a0Appendix 1\u00a0to\u00a0Appendix 2. The strategies were developed by the Information Specialist for Cochrane Consumers and Communication and were informed by searching guidelines from the Cochrane Qualitative and Implementation Methods Group (Harris 2018). After a review of preliminary search results, we applied the McMaster University Health Information Research Unit qualitative filter (Wong 2004) to increase specificity (consistent with our purposive sampling approach). On testing, this filter has been shown to have 61% sensitivity, 99% specificity, 37% precision and 99% accuracy. We searched the ProQuest Theses and Dissertations database. In March 2019, using keywords, we also searched the websites of key national and international organisations involved in promoting person\u2010centred care, including The King's Fund (https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/), The Health Foundation (https://www.health.org.uk), National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (https://www.nice.org.uk), Planetree (https://www.planetree.org), Picker Institute Europe (https://www.picker.org), Institute for Health Improvement (www.ihi.org), World Health Organization (https://www.who.int), Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care (https://www.safetyandquality.gov.au/), and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (https://www.ahrq.gov). We also searched reference lists of sampled studies and relevant systematic reviews. This resulted in the identification of a further 127 studies that were not in the databases above. Additionally, we searched the included studies in the linked intervention review by\u00a0Lowe 2021\u00a0for eligible qualitative trial sibling studies.",

        "Data collection and analysis": "All titles and abstracts were screened independently by at least two review authors (BM, LS, DL, LW, LGW, CC, CG). Using\u00a0Covidence\u00a0software, each author classified each title and abstract as either irrelevant ('no'), relevant (yes') or potentially relevant ('maybe'). Studies were classified as 'irrelevant' if two review authors graded as 'no'. Where there was a combination of yes/no or maybe/no, then the conflict was resolved either through discussion or consulting a third review author. Studies that were graded yes/yes or maybe/yes or maybe/maybe progressed to full\u2010text review. Each full\u2010text article was screened for inclusion or exclusion by at least two people independently. This included screening by Stakeholder Panel members (CW, NR, DM, FM, RC, MG, AM, PB, SB) and at least one member of the research team (BM, LS, DL, LW, CC, SH). Discrepancies were resolved by discussion or by consulting a third review author. We listed all potentially relevant papers excluded from the review at this stage as excluded studies, with reasons provided in the 'Characteristics of excluded studies' table. We reported the screening and selection process in an adapted PRISMA flow chart shown in\u00a0Figure 1\u00a0(Liberati 2009). We identified 182 studies that met our inclusion criteria. PRISMA flow diagram Given the high number of included studies and large volume of data, synthesising all of the studies would have threatened the quality of the synthesis (Cochrane EPOC 2017). Therefore, we used purposive sampling to reduce the number of included studies to a manageable amount. Our sampling frame involved these three steps. 1. All eligible studies were initially rated by one review author (BM, LS or SH) using the 5\u2010point data richness scale developed by\u00a0Ames 2019. The scale ranks data richness from 1 (very little qualitative data related to the synthesis objective) to 5 (a large amount and depth of qualitative data that relate in depth to the synthesis objective). A second review author (BM, SH or LS) checked the ratings and disagreements were resolved by consensus or consulting a third review author. Any studies rated 4 of 5 by at least one author progressed to the next step. 2. One review author (SH) sampled to achieve balance across the following criteria. Country and income region (e.g. low\u2010 and middle\u2010income countries, high\u2010income countries)   Jurisdictional and geographical setting (e.g. provincial or state, rural or metropolitan)   Service type (e.g. tertiary or primary health service)   Service provision purpose (e.g. cancer, mental health, emergency department, all areas)   Purpose of partnering (e.g. quality improvement, health service governance, evaluation)   Breadth of services covered (e.g. partnering across a range of services compared to studies focusing on a single service)    Populations (e.g. consumers, carers, health professionals, managers, policymakers, under\u2010represented populations) Country and income region (e.g. low\u2010 and middle\u2010income countries, high\u2010income countries) Jurisdictional and geographical setting (e.g. provincial or state, rural or metropolitan) Service type (e.g. tertiary or primary health service) Service provision purpose (e.g. cancer, mental health, emergency department, all areas) Purpose of partnering (e.g. quality improvement, health service governance, evaluation) Breadth of services covered (e.g. partnering across a range of services compared to studies focusing on a single service) Populations (e.g. consumers, carers, health professionals, managers, policymakers, under\u2010represented populations) This process was checked by a second review author (BM) and any disagreements were resolved by consensus. 3. Any gaps remaining in the sampling frame were examined and studies with data richness of 3 that would fill the gaps were sought. At the end of this sampling process, 33/182 studies were selected for inclusion in the final synthesis. One review author (LS or BM) then extracted data from each study using a form adapted from Cochrane Consumers and Communication's Data Extraction Template (available at: cccrg.cochrane.org/author-resources) and the\u00a0NICE 2012\u00a0Examples of Evidence Tables for Qualitative Studies. We extracted the following data: details of the study (methodology, data collection and analysis methods, setting, geographic location), details of the participants (number and description of participants, methods of recruitment, sampling and inclusion criteria), details of the partnering approach (type of partnering, participants in the partnering approach). All extracted data were checked for accuracy against the data extraction sheets by a second review author (AV). Data were entered into\u00a0NVivo 2018\u00a0which is software used for analysing qualitative data. One review author entered the data initially (LS) and it was checked for accuracy by a second review author (BM). We appraised the quality of each included study using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) tool (CASP 2018). We chose the CASP because it provided for the assessment of the following domains of methodological strengths and limitations: clear aims and research question, congruence between the aims and the research design, rigour of sampling and data collection to address the question, and appropriate application of the method (Noyes 2018). Five members of the author team with qualitative methods experience (BM, SH, VX, LGW, DL) each assessed the quality of three studies and then a consensus meeting was held to agree on the ratings and determine how the CASP would be applied to the remaining studies. The CASP tool was then applied to each sampled study by one review author (BM, VX, LGW, DL, LS). A second review author, also with qualitative methods experience, checked each appraisal for discrepancies. Any disagreements were resolved through discussion or consultation with a third review author. We did not exclude any studies on the basis of quality because this may have resulted in the loss of valuable insights (Hannes 2011). However, the appraisal formed part of the review authors' judgements when conducting the GRADE\u2010CERQual assessment (Lewin 2018; described below), which determined how much confidence we had in each finding of the synthesis. As per the protocol, we originally intended to conduct a 'Thematic synthesis' of the data (Thomas 2008). We began by selecting the five articles in the sample considered most relevant to the synthesis objective (Croft 2016;\u00a0Johns 2014;\u00a0MacDonald 2015;\u00a0Nathan 2014;\u00a0Sharma 2016). Each of these articles was then coded line\u2010by\u2010line by at least two review authors independently (BM, DL, LGW, VX). After discussing the line\u2010by\u2010line coding process, review authors (BM, DL, LGW, VX) decided to change the synthesis method to 'Framework synthesis' (Oliver 2008) for two reasons. Firstly, we reflected that many of the studies in our QES directly addressed the review objectives and therefore a synthesis method that allowed explicit consideration of the objectives as part of a coding framework would be preferable (Dixon\u2010Woods 2011). Secondly, we considered the time required for line\u2010by\u2010coding of the remaining 28 studies was not feasible within the time available for the project (Booth 2018). Following the change to Framework Synthesis, BM developed a draft framework based on the review objectives, with the most common codes from the line\u2010by\u2010line coding already completed, being categorised under the relevant objective. This draft framework was discussed by BM, DL, LGW and VX, who made further revisions and additions. Once the framework was finalised, the sampled articles were uploaded into\u00a0NVivo 2018. Data in the articles were then indexed against the framework by two review authors (BM, LS). To ensure the authors were coding similarly, BM and LS compared their indexing on five articles. Any differences in coding were discussed and resolved by consensus. Once the review authors established they were applying the framework similarly, only one review author (BM or LS) indexed the remaining articles. Once all articles were indexed, two review authors (BM, LS) began constructing a picture of the data \"as a whole\" by charting emerging themes and sub\u2010themes occurring across the data set. These themes were then tested and refined, by comparing and contrasting data both within and across themes. The final themes were then discussed at a meeting with members of the research team (BM, DL, CC, VX, LGW, SH) as well as a Stakeholder Panel member (CW). Further refinements were then made. The finalised themes became our 'findings' for the purposes of this review. The 19 findings were then grouped into five overarching categories to provide a structured narrative for the Findings section (Ames 2019a). We used the GRADE\u2010CERQual approach to assess confidence in the review findings (Lewin 2018). GRADE\u2010CERQual assesses the extent to which the findings of the review are representative of the phenomenon being explored (Lewin 2018). The assessment is based on four components: the methodological limitations of the studies contributing to the finding; the relevance to the review question of the studies contributing to the review finding; the adequacy of the data supporting the review finding; and the coherence of the review finding (Lewin 2015). After making judgements about these four components, we gave each finding an overall rating of confidence as high, moderate, low or very low. We applied the GRADE\u2010CERQual assessment to each review finding through discussion by two review authors working collaboratively (BM, AV). We have presented a 'CERQual evidence profile' for each finding. This includes the assessment for each CERQual component, the overall CERQual assessment, and the studies contributing to each finding. The 'Summary of Qualitative Findings' tables also included the overall confidence assessment for each finding, and the justification of the confidence assessment. We used a matrix approach to integrate the findings of the QES with the findings of the concurrent\u00a0Lowe 2021\u00a0intervention effects review (Harden 2018). This approach has been used previously by Cochrane authors (see, for example,\u00a0Ames 2019a). As the sampled qualitative articles mainly came from studies unrelated to the trials, the review authors adapted the QES findings into key questions to ask about the design of the interventions. These questions were listed along one side of a matrix with each of the included trials in\u00a0Lowe 2021\u00a0plotted against them. When a question had been addressed in the design of the trial, this was marked as \"y\" for \"yes\". When the question had not been addressed, this was marked as \"n\". This helped to identify which questions were routinely addressed in trials, and the gaps that should be considered when designing future trials. To provide an initial framework for the development of the best practice principles, the key questions used in the matrix approach, which reflected the findings of the review, were adapted into draft statements of best practice. The statements were then considered at a teleconference of the Stakeholder Panel. Members of the panel discussed the principles and formulated key recommendations for changes to the draft principles. Recommendations included the following: that the principles did not sufficiently address the power imbalances in formal partnerships and diversity needed in formal partnerships; that the principles needed to be broader, but supported with additional practical examples from the findings to enhance applicability; that the language of some of the draft principles needed to be strengthened. The draft principles were then revised by BM and SH and further feedback was sought from the Stakeholder Panel via email. Further minor changes were made on the basis of the feedback and the final draft was approved by the review authors and Stakeholder Panel members. Regular meetings of the author team and stakeholder panel enhanced the authors' awareness of their own role in the research process. For example, stakeholder meetings helped the review authors to identify underlying biases in applying the selection criteria to full\u2010text studies. During the data analysis phase, only review authors with qualitative methods experience or training (BM, LS, SH, LGW, VX, LW, DL) were directly involved in coding and quality appraisal of the included studies. These review authors met regularly to uncover underlying assumptions that may have influenced the initial coding and quality appraisal ratings, such as their own interactions with the health system, their professional backgrounds and experiences of consumer involvement in health services and research. These review authors all shared a perspective that consumer involvement in health service design, delivery and evaluation could be improved. The Stakeholder Panel also met to discuss the draft findings. At the meeting, stakeholders were asked for their perceptions of the findings, including any potential gaps in the analysis or unexpected findings. At this stage, some stakeholders expressed surprise that training of health providers was not identified in the findings. Following the meeting, this led to re\u2010checking the primary data with \"health provider training\" as a sensitising concept and realising there was a small, but sufficient, amount of data overlooked in the initial analysis, which suggested that training of health providers about consumer involvement could be useful. Thus, the draft findings were updated with these new data. However, other suggestions for potential missing findings from the stakeholder panel, for example, \"characteristics of effective consumer representatives\", was not found when the data were re\u2010checked and therefore were not included. This process ensured that risk to rigour from competing personal biases was acknowledged and minimised.",

Country and income region (e.g. low\u2010 and middle\u2010income countries, high\u2010income countries)   Jurisdictional and geographical setting (e.g. provincial or state, rural or metropolitan)   Service type (e.g. tertiary or primary health service)   Service provision purpose (e.g. cancer, mental health, emergency department, all areas)   Purpose of partnering (e.g. quality improvement, health service governance, evaluation)   Breadth of services covered (e.g. partnering across a range of services compared to studies focusing on a single service)    Populations (e.g. consumers, carers, health professionals, managers, policymakers, under\u2010represented populations)     This process was checked by a second review author (BM) and any disagreements were resolved by consensus.  3. Any gaps remaining in the sampling frame were examined and studies with data richness of 3 that would fill the gaps were sought.  At the end of this sampling process, 33/182 studies were selected for inclusion in the final synthesis.  One review author (LS or BM) then extracted data from each study using a form adapted from Cochrane Consumers and Communication's Data Extraction Template (available at: cccrg.cochrane.org/author-resources) and the\u00a0NICE 2012\u00a0Examples of Evidence Tables for Qualitative Studies. We extracted the following data: details of the study (methodology, data collection and analysis methods, setting, geographic location), details of the participants (number and description of participants, methods of recruitment, sampling and inclusion criteria), details of the partnering approach (type of partnering, participants in the partnering approach). All extracted data were checked for accuracy against the data extraction sheets by a second review author (AV).  Data were entered into\u00a0NVivo 2018\u00a0which is software used for analysing qualitative data. One review author entered the data initially (LS) and it was checked for accuracy by a second review author (BM).   Appraisal of study quality We appraised the quality of each included study using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) tool (CASP 2018). We chose the CASP because it provided for the assessment of the following domains of methodological strengths and limitations: clear aims and research question, congruence between the aims and the research design, rigour of sampling and data collection to address the question, and appropriate application of the method (Noyes 2018). Five members of the author team with qualitative methods experience (BM, SH, VX, LGW, DL) each assessed the quality of three studies and then a consensus meeting was held to agree on the ratings and determine how the CASP would be applied to the remaining studies.  The CASP tool was then applied to each sampled study by one review author (BM, VX, LGW, DL, LS). A second review author, also with qualitative methods experience, checked each appraisal for discrepancies. Any disagreements were resolved through discussion or consultation with a third review author. We did not exclude any studies on the basis of quality because this may have resulted in the loss of valuable insights (Hannes 2011). However, the appraisal formed part of the review authors' judgements when conducting the GRADE\u2010CERQual assessment (Lewin 2018; described below), which determined how much confidence we had in each finding of the synthesis.    Data synthesis As per the protocol, we originally intended to conduct a 'Thematic synthesis' of the data (Thomas 2008). We began by selecting the five articles in the sample considered most relevant to the synthesis objective (Croft 2016;\u00a0Johns 2014;\u00a0MacDonald 2015;\u00a0Nathan 2014;\u00a0Sharma 2016). Each of these articles was then coded line\u2010by\u2010line by at least two review authors independently (BM, DL, LGW, VX). After discussing the line\u2010by\u2010line coding process, review authors (BM, DL, LGW, VX) decided to change the synthesis method to 'Framework synthesis' (Oliver 2008) for two reasons. Firstly, we reflected that many of the studies in our QES directly addressed the review objectives and therefore a synthesis method that allowed explicit consideration of the objectives as part of a coding framework would be preferable (Dixon\u2010Woods 2011). Secondly, we considered the time required for line\u2010by\u2010coding of the remaining 28 studies was not feasible within the time available for the project (Booth 2018). Following the change to Framework Synthesis, BM developed a draft framework based on the review objectives, with the most common codes from the line\u2010by\u2010line coding already completed, being categorised under the relevant objective. This draft framework was discussed by BM, DL, LGW and VX, who made further revisions and additions.  Once the framework was finalised, the sampled articles were uploaded into\u00a0NVivo 2018. Data in the articles were then indexed against the framework by two review authors (BM, LS). To ensure the authors were coding similarly, BM and LS compared their indexing on five articles. Any differences in coding were discussed and resolved by consensus. Once the review authors established they were applying the framework similarly, only one review author (BM or LS) indexed the remaining articles.  Once all articles were indexed, two review authors (BM, LS) began constructing a picture of the data \"as a whole\" by charting emerging themes and sub\u2010themes occurring across the data set. These themes were then tested and refined, by comparing and contrasting data both within and across themes. The final themes were then discussed at a meeting with members of the research team (BM, DL, CC, VX, LGW, SH) as well as a Stakeholder Panel member (CW). Further refinements were then made. The finalised themes became our 'findings' for the purposes of this review. The 19 findings were then grouped into five overarching categories to provide a structured narrative for the Findings section (Ames 2019a).    Assessment of confidence in the review findings We used the GRADE\u2010CERQual approach to assess confidence in the review findings (Lewin 2018). GRADE\u2010CERQual assesses the extent to which the findings of the review are representative of the phenomenon being explored (Lewin 2018). The assessment is based on four components: the methodological limitations of the studies contributing to the finding; the relevance to the review question of the studies contributing to the review finding; the adequacy of the data supporting the review finding; and the coherence of the review finding (Lewin 2015). After making judgements about these four components, we gave each finding an overall rating of confidence as high, moderate, low or very low. We applied the GRADE\u2010CERQual assessment to each review finding through discussion by two review authors working collaboratively (BM, AV). We have presented a 'CERQual evidence profile' for each finding. This includes the assessment for each CERQual component, the overall CERQual assessment, and the studies contributing to each finding. The 'Summary of Qualitative Findings' tables also included the overall confidence assessment for each finding, and the justification of the confidence assessment.    Using the synthesised qualitative findings to supplement a published Cochrane effectiveness review  We used a matrix approach to integrate the findings of the QES with the findings of the concurrent\u00a0Lowe 2021\u00a0intervention effects review (Harden 2018). This approach has been used previously by Cochrane authors (see, for example,\u00a0Ames 2019a). As the sampled qualitative articles mainly came from studies unrelated to the trials, the review authors adapted the QES findings into key questions to ask about the design of the interventions. These questions were listed along one side of a matrix with each of the included trials in\u00a0Lowe 2021\u00a0plotted against them. When a question had been addressed in the design of the trial, this was marked as \"y\" for \"yes\". When the question had not been addressed, this was marked as \"n\". This helped to identify which questions were routinely addressed in trials, and the gaps that should be considered when designing future trials.    Developing the best practice principles To provide an initial framework for the development of the best practice principles, the key questions used in the matrix approach, which reflected the findings of the review, were adapted into draft statements of best practice. The statements were then considered at a teleconference of the Stakeholder Panel. Members of the panel discussed the principles and formulated key recommendations for changes to the draft principles. Recommendations included the following: that the principles did not sufficiently address the power imbalances in formal partnerships and diversity needed in formal partnerships; that the principles needed to be broader, but supported with additional practical examples from the findings to enhance applicability; that the language of some of the draft principles needed to be strengthened. The draft principles were then revised by BM and SH and further feedback was sought from the Stakeholder Panel via email. Further minor changes were made on the basis of the feedback and the final draft was approved by the review authors and Stakeholder Panel members.    Author reflexivity Regular meetings of the author team and stakeholder panel enhanced the authors' awareness of their own role in the research process. For example, stakeholder meetings helped the review authors to identify underlying biases in applying the selection criteria to full\u2010text studies. During the data analysis phase, only review authors with qualitative methods experience or training (BM, LS, SH, LGW, VX, LW, DL) were directly involved in coding and quality appraisal of the included studies. These review authors met regularly to uncover underlying assumptions that may have influenced the initial coding and quality appraisal ratings, such as their own interactions with the health system, their professional backgrounds and experiences of consumer involvement in health services and research. These review authors all shared a perspective that consumer involvement in health service design, delivery and evaluation could be improved.  The Stakeholder Panel also met to discuss the draft findings. At the meeting, stakeholders were asked for their perceptions of the findings, including any potential gaps in the analysis or unexpected findings. At this stage, some stakeholders expressed surprise that training of health providers was not identified in the findings. Following the meeting, this led to re\u2010checking the primary data with \"health provider training\" as a sensitising concept and realising there was a small, but sufficient, amount of data overlooked in the initial analysis, which suggested that training of health providers about consumer involvement could be useful. Thus, the draft findings were updated with these new data. However, other suggestions for potential missing findings from the stakeholder panel, for example, \"characteristics of effective consumer representatives\", was not found when the data were re\u2010checked and therefore were not included. This process ensured that risk to rigour from competing personal biases was acknowledged and minimised."

Finding 6. Positive interpersonal dynamics between health providers and consumers that facilitated partnerships. Mutual respect, commitment, two way dialogue and information exchange were helpful. Trust, accountability, regular group communication and strong relationships with decision\u2010makers were also facilitators. Partnerships that were equitable with shared values, a shared vision and shared decision\u2010making powers were preferable. Skilled facilitators, moderators and consumer coordinators could help to facilitate positive interpersonal dynamics.

Finding 13. Working in partnership could affect health providers and consumer participants in both positive and negative ways. Health providers perceived consumers provided a unique perspective that could improve services, but they were concerned about the time pressures and unmet expectations that could accompany their involvement in partnerships. Consumers perceived there were benefits of working in partnership, including empowerment, increased confidence, knowledge and skills. However, they reported that participating in partnerships could be physically and/or emotionally demanding.

Expanded matrix table": "Based on the findings of the QES, we explored whether the trialists had described the following aspects of working in partnership:     Was the partnership conducted in a supportive government policy context?   Was the partnership conducted in a supportive organisational context?   Were consumers involved in the recruitment process?   Were resources in place to recruit and support members from groups who are underserved?   If expected to represent other consumers, were consumers facilitated to do this (e.g. with data, peer networks etc)?    Were strategies used to facilitate positive interpersonal dynamics in the partnership?   Were consumers offered training and practical support to facilitate their participation in the partnership?    Were consumers and health providers both clear about the expectations of the consumer role, and were consumers involved in shaping their role?    Were strategies used to decrease the potential for consumers to feel intimidated a) in a formal group formats and b) working with health providers?    Were strategies used to ensure consumers could contribute meaningfully to the agenda, including leading the meeting and/or contributing their own priorities?    Were consumers involved meaningfully in decision\u2010making in the partnership?   Were strategies used to reduce negative effects of partnerships on both health providers and consumers?

        "Appendix 9. Glossary of key terms": "Consumers: for the purposes of this review, consumers were defined a patient, carer or community member who brought their perspective to health service partnerships. The term also included consultants who were employed by the health service to represent the patient or carer perspective. This definition is a simplified version of that used in the companion intervention effects review (Lowe 2021).  Formal group partnerships: for the purposes of this review, formal group partnerships were defined as consumers and health providers meeting jointly and regularly in formal group formats (e.g. committees, councils, working groups) to share decision\u2010making for the purpose of planning, delivery or evaluation in one or more health service(s). The same definition was used in the companion intervention effects review (Lowe 2021).  Health providers: for the purposes of this review, health providers referred to a person who had a health policy, management, administrative, or clinical role and who participated in formal partnerships in an advisory or representative capacity. A health provider did not include a person whose primary role was a health researcher. This definition is a simplified version of that used in the companion intervention effects review (Lowe 2021).  Health services: defined as public or privately funded services that provide direct care to consumers in primary (e.g. community health centres, general practitioner practices, private practices, dispensaries), secondary (e.g. specialist outpatient clinics), or tertiary settings (e.g. hospitals). We included home and residential services only when they were primarily providing health or nursing care (e.g. home\u2010based nursing services, nursing homes, residential rehabilitation services, or hospices). The same definition was used in the companion intervention effects review (Lowe 2021).  Intervention effects review: in a systematic review of intervention effects, the researchers aim to locate, assess the risk of bias, and synthesise all of the available evidence related to a specific research question about the effects of an intervention. The companion intervention effects review by\u00a0Lowe 2021\u00a0addressed the question \u2018what are the effects of consumers and health providers working in partnership on health services planning, delivery and evaluation'?\u00a0  Partnering (as an intervention): For the purposes of this review, the intervention was defined as:     consumers and health providers engaged in formal group formats, such as committees, councils, boards or steering groups;    the group involved at least one consumer and at least one health provider;   the group met jointly, more than once via face\u2010to\u2010face or electronic modes;   the group was either ongoing or time\u2010limited (for example, groups formed for a specific project);    the group made joint decisions for planning and/or delivery and/or evaluation of health services.     The same definition was used in the companion intervention effects review (Lowe 2021).  Qualitative evidence synthesis: in a systematic review of qualitative evidence, the researchers aim to locate, assess the methodological quality, and synthesise evidence related to a specific research question about the experience of a phenomenon. When combined with an intervention effects review, the qualitative evidence synthesis aims to help understand how the intervention works, for whom, and in what context, and how best to implement it (Flemming 2019). In this case, the question is \u2018what are consumers and health providers\u2019 views and experiences of partnering to improve health services planning, delivery and evaluation'?"
