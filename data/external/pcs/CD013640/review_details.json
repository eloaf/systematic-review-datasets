    "title": "Balanced crystalloid solutions versus 0.9% saline for treating acute diarrhoea and severe dehydration in children",
    "abstract": "Background Although acute diarrhoea is a self\u2010limiting disease, dehydration may occur in some children. Dehydration is the consequence of an increased loss of water and electrolytes (sodium, chloride, potassium, and bicarbonate) in liquid stools. When these losses are high and not replaced adequately, severe dehydration appears. Severe dehydration is corrected with intravenous solutions. The most frequently used solution for this purpose is 0.9% saline. Balanced solutions (e.g. Ringer's lactate) are alternatives to 0.9% saline and have been associated with fewer days of hospitalization and better biochemical outcomes. Available guidelines provide conflicting recommendations. It is unclear whether 0.9% saline or balanced intravenous fluids are most effective for rehydrating children with severe dehydration due to diarrhoea.    Objectives To evaluate the benefits and harms of balanced solutions for the rapid rehydration of children with severe dehydration due to acute diarrhoea, in terms of time in hospital and mortality compared to 0.9% saline.    Search methods We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 4 May 2022.    Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials in children with severe dehydration due to acute diarrhoea comparing balanced solutions, such as Ringer's lactate or Plasma\u2010Lyte with 0.9% saline solution, for rapid rehydration.    Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were 1. time in hospital and 2. mortality. Our secondary outcomes were 3. need for additional fluids, 4. total amount of fluids received, 5. time to resolution of metabolic acidosis, 6. change in and the final values of biochemical measures (pH, bicarbonate, sodium, chloride, potassium, and creatinine), 7. incidence of acute kidney injury, and 8. adverse events. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence.    Main results Characteristics of the included studies  We included five studies with 465 children. Data for meta\u2010analysis were available from 441 children. Four studies were conducted in low\u2010 and middle\u2010income countries and one study in two high\u2010income countries. Four studies evaluated Ringer's lactate, and one study evaluated Plasma\u2010Lyte. Two studies reported the time in hospital, and only one study reported mortality as an outcome. Four studies reported final pH and five studies reported bicarbonate levels. Adverse events reported were hyponatremia and hypokalaemia in two studies each.  Risk of bias  All studies had at least one domain at high or unclear risk of bias. The risk of bias assessment informed the GRADE assessments.  Primary outcomes  Compared to 0.9% saline, the balanced solutions likely result in a slight reduction of the time in hospital (mean difference (MD) \u22120.35 days, 95% confidence interval (CI) \u22120.60 to \u22120.10; 2 studies; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). However, the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of the balanced solutions on mortality during hospitalization in severely dehydrated children (risk ratio (RR) 0.33, 95% CI 0.02 to 7.39; 1 study, 22 children; very low\u2010certainty evidence).  Secondary outcomes  Balanced solutions probably produce a higher increase in blood pH (MD 0.06, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.09; 4 studies, 366 children; low\u2010certainty evidence) and bicarbonate levels (MD 2.44 mEq/L, 95% CI 0.92 to 3.97; 443 children, four studies; low\u2010certainty evidence). Furthermore, balanced solutions likely reduces the risk of hypokalaemia after the intravenous correction (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.96; 2 studies, 147 children; moderate\u2010certainty evidence).  Nonetheless, the evidence suggests that balanced solutions may result in no difference in the need for additional intravenous fluids after the initial correction; in the amount of fluids administered; or in the mean change of sodium, chloride, potassium, and creatinine levels.    Authors' conclusions The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of balanced solutions on mortality during hospitalization in severely dehydrated children. However, balanced solutions likely result in a slight reduction of the time in the hospital compared to 0.9% saline. Also, balanced solutions likely reduce the risk of hypokalaemia after intravenous correction.  Furthermore, the evidence suggests that balanced solutions compared to 0.9% saline probably produce no changes in the need for additional intravenous fluids or in other biochemical measures such as sodium, chloride, potassium, and creatinine levels. Last, there may be no difference between balanced solutions and 0.9% saline in the incidence of hyponatraemia.",
