    "title": "Accuracy of measures for antiretroviral adherence in people living with HIV",
    "abstract": "Background Good patient adherence to antiretroviral (ART) medication determines effective HIV viral suppression, and thus reduces the risk of progression and transmission of HIV. With accurate methods to monitor treatment adherence, we could use simple triage to target adherence support interventions that could help in the community or at health centres in resource\u2010limited settings.    Objectives To determine the accuracy of simple measures of ART adherence (including patient self\u2010report, tablet counts, pharmacy records, electronic monitoring, or composite methods) for detecting non\u2010suppressed viral load in people living with HIV and receiving ART treatment.    Search methods The Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Information Specialists searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL, African\u2010Wide information, and Web of Science up to 22 April 2021. They also searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing studies. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.    Selection criteria We included studies of all designs that evaluated a simple measure of adherence (index test) such as self\u2010report, tablet counts, pharmacy records or secondary database analysis, or both, electronic monitoring or composite measures of any of those tests, in people living with HIV and receiving ART treatment. We used a viral load assay with a limit of detection ranging from 10 copies/mL to 400 copies/mL as the reference standard. We created 2 \u00d7 2 tables to calculate sensitivity and specificity.    Data collection and analysis We screened studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias using QUADAS\u20102 independently and in duplicate. We assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE method. The results of estimated sensitivity and specificity were presented using paired forest plots and tabulated summaries. We encountered a high level of variation among studies which precluded a meaningful meta\u2010analysis or comparison of adherence measures. We explored heterogeneity using pre\u2010defined subgroup analysis.    Main results We included 51 studies involving children and adults with HIV, mostly living in low\u2010 and middle\u2010income settings, conducted between 2003 and 2021. Several studies assessed more than one index test, and the most common measure of adherence to ART was self\u2010report.  \u2010 Self\u2010report questionnaires (25 studies, 9211 participants; very low\u2010certainty): sensitivity ranged from 10% to 85% and specificity ranged from 10% to 99%.  \u2010 Self\u2010report using a visual analogue scale (VAS) (11 studies, 4235 participants; very low\u2010certainty): sensitivity ranged from 0% to 58% and specificity ranged from 55% to 100%.  \u2010 Tablet counts (12 studies, 3466 participants; very low\u2010certainty): sensitivity ranged from 0% to 100% and specificity ranged from 5% to 99%.  \u2010 Electronic monitoring devices (3 studies, 186 participants; very low\u2010certainty): sensitivity ranged from 60% to 88% and the specificity ranged from 27% to 67%.  \u2010 Pharmacy records or secondary databases (6 studies, 2254 participants; very low\u2010certainty): sensitivity ranged from 17% to 88% and the specificity ranged from 9% to 95%.  \u2010 Composite measures (9 studies, 1513 participants; very low\u2010certainty): sensitivity ranged from 10% to 100% and specificity ranged from 49% to 100%.  Across all included studies, the ability of adherence measures to detect viral non\u2010suppression showed a large variation in both sensitivity and specificity that could not be explained by subgroup analysis. We assessed the overall certainty of the evidence as very low due to risk of bias, indirectness, inconsistency, and imprecision.  The risk of bias and the applicability concerns for patient selection, index test, and reference standard domains were generally low or unclear due to unclear reporting. The main methodological issues identified were related to flow and timing due to high numbers of missing data. For all index tests, we assessed the certainty of the evidence as very low due to limitations in the design and conduct of the studies, applicability concerns and inconsistency of results.    Authors' conclusions We encountered high variability for all index tests, and the overall certainty of evidence in all areas was very low. No measure consistently offered either a sufficiently high sensitivity or specificity to detect viral non\u2010suppression. These concerns limit their value in triaging patients for viral load monitoring or enhanced adherence support interventions.",

The study did not report the lower limit of detection of the viral load assay used.   The study used a viral load assay with a lower limit of detection greater than 400 copies/mL.

        "Participants": "We included studies that recruited HIV\u2010positive adults, adolescents, and children who had been established on ART for longer than six months at the time of assessment.",
        "Index tests": "The index tests included measures of adherence that could be utilized in resource\u2010limited settings: self\u2010report;   tablet counts;   pharmacy records or secondary database analysis, or both;   electronic monitoring;   composite measures of the above. self\u2010report; tablet counts; pharmacy records or secondary database analysis, or both; electronic monitoring; composite measures of the above. We categorized and analysed studies according to the above headings. There are no specific consensus criteria for identifying adherence versus non\u2010adherence. Studies may report different dichotomized thresholds between \u2018non\u2010adherent' and \u2018adherent' in relation to measures of adherence that report implementation of a dosing regimen over a defined interval of time. For example: self\u2010report: count\u2010 or estimate\u2010based measures of percentage adherence over a given period;    tablet counts: adherence percentage based on expected versus actual tablets taken over dispensing period;    pharmacy records or secondary database analysis, or both;   electronic monitoring: per cent of doses received as measured;   composite measures of the above given a pooled percentage estimate. self\u2010report: count\u2010 or estimate\u2010based measures of percentage adherence over a given period; tablet counts: adherence percentage based on expected versus actual tablets taken over dispensing period; pharmacy records or secondary database analysis, or both; electronic monitoring: per cent of doses received as measured; composite measures of the above given a pooled percentage estimate. All these measures estimate a percentage of time during which a patient takes the medication as prescribed. Typically, these studies then dichotomize \u2018adherence' and \u2018non\u2010adherence', based on a percentage threshold. Our definitions for the four test accuracy categories are as follows: true positive: the index test correctly identifies non\u2010adherence to ART, and as such, detects a non\u2010suppressed viral load;    true negative: the index test correctly identifies adherence to ART, and as such, detects a suppressed viral load;    false positive: the index test misclassifies a person as non\u2010adherent to ART, and fails to detect a suppressed viral load;    false negative: the index test misclassifies a person as adherent to ART, and fails to detect a non\u2010suppressed viral load. true positive: the index test correctly identifies non\u2010adherence to ART, and as such, detects a non\u2010suppressed viral load; true negative: the index test correctly identifies adherence to ART, and as such, detects a suppressed viral load; false positive: the index test misclassifies a person as non\u2010adherent to ART, and fails to detect a suppressed viral load; false negative: the index test misclassifies a person as adherent to ART, and fails to detect a non\u2010suppressed viral load.",
        "Target conditions": "The target condition is viral non\u2010suppression. We defined this as an HIV RNA level above the lower limit of detection of the assay used within the study in question.",
        "Reference standards": "We used a reference standard of non\u2010suppressed viral load, as detected using nucleic acid testing technologies. This is any viral load which is above the lower limit of detection of the available assay. This varies between assays, ranging from 10 copies/mL to 400 copies/mL in those which are currently available."

We will describe the measure of adherence, and how the researchers interpreted it.   We will describe the method used to measure viral load and the lower limit of detection of the assay.    We will describe any interval between the adherence measure and the viral load measurement.     Signalling questions (yes, no, unclear)    Consecutive or random sample of patients?   Yes: if authors stated they used random patient sampling or consecutive enrolment.  No: when patients were selected, for example, based on previously identified concerns regarding adherence.  Unclear: if authors provided insufficient information.    Index test results interpreted without knowledge of the results of reference standard?   Yes: if authors clearly reported that the measures of adherence were applied and interpreted before the viral load result was available.  No: if authors reported that the measures were applied or interpreted after the viral load was available.  Unclear: if authors provided insufficient information.    Reference standard likely to correctly classify the target condition?   Yes: if authors clearly reported that a laboratory reference test was used at a manufacturer recommended threshold of lower limit of detection, and this was < 400 copies/mL.  No: if authors reported application of a post hoc threshold.  Unclear: if authors provided insufficient information.    Appropriate interval between measure of adherence and viral load measurement?   Yes: if the measure of adherence and the measure of viral load were made on the same day.  No: if time period between measure of adherence and viral load was not made on the same day.  Unclear: if authors provided insufficient information.      Did the study avoid inappropriate exclusions?   Yes: if there were no inappropriate exclusions.  No: if there was evidence that authors inappropriately excluded certain patients, e.g. those deemed to have limited ability to use electronic monitoring devices, or excluded those with literacy concerns if self\u2010report measures were to be self\u2010administered.  Unclear: if authors provided insufficient information.    Prespecified threshold used?   Yes: if authors reported an a priori threshold value (or values) for adherence.  No: if authors determined threshold values post hoc.  Unclear: if authors provided insufficient information.    Reference standard results interpreted without knowledge of the index test?   Yes: if authors reported that viral loads were measured and recorded without a priori knowledge of the measure of adherence result.  No: if authors reported that viral load was measured or recorded with knowledge of the measure of adherence result.  Unclear: if authors provided insufficient information.

If we answer both signalling questions for a domain \u2018no', then we will judge risk of bias as high.    If we answer both signalling questions for a domain \u2018unclear', then we will judge the risk of bias as unclear.    If we answer both signalling questions for a domain differently, the authors will discuss this further to reach a final judgement, and explain the rationale for this judgement within the Risk of bias table.         Applicability concerns (high, low, unclear)    Are there concerns that the included patients do not match the review question?   High: if some but not all included patients were concurrently receiving interventions to improve their adherence, rather than the same standard of care, and these groups cannot be separated.  Low: if all patients were receiving the same standard of care.  Unclear: if there was insufficient information to make a judgement.    Are there concerns that the index test, its conduct, or interpretation differs from the review question?   High: if the measure of adherence was not truly applicable in a resource\u2010limited setting, e.g. requiring additional remote information infrastructure or analysis.  Low: if the measure of adherence could feasibly be applied in a resource\u2010limited setting.  Unclear: if there was insufficient information to make a judgement.    \u2014   \u2014",

We will describe the measure of adherence, and how the researchers interpreted it.   We will describe the method used to measure viral load and the lower limit of detection of the assay.    We will describe any interval between the adherence measure and the viral load measurement.     Signalling questions  (yes, no, unclear)    Consecutive or random sample of patients?   Yes: if authors stated they used random patient sampling or consecutive enrolment.  No: when patients were selected, for example, based on previously identified concerns regarding adherence.  Unclear: if authors provided insufficient information.    Index test results interpreted without knowledge of the results of reference standard?   Yes: if authors clearly reported that the measures of adherence were applied and interpreted before the viral load result was available.  No: if authors reported that the measures were applied or interpreted after the viral load was available.  Unclear: if authors provided insufficient information.    Reference standard likely to correctly classify the target condition?   Yes: if authors clearly reported that a laboratory reference test was used at a manufacturer recommended threshold of lower limit of detection, and this was < 400 copies/mL.  No: if authors reported application of a post hoc threshold, or use of more than one viral assay.  Unclear: if authors provided insufficient information, for example, not stating which assay was used, and the lower limit of detection for this assay.    Appropriate interval between measure of adherence and viral load measurement?   Yes: if the measure of adherence and the measure of viral load were made on the same day.  No: if time period between measure of adherence and viral load was not made on the same day (this is an exclusion criterion).  Unclear: if authors provided insufficient information.      Was case control design avoided?   Yes: no evidence that non\u2010adherent were recruited different to adherent patients No: evidence that people who were poorly adherent were recruited in a different way to those who were adherent  Unclear: not stated     Did all patients receive a viral load, using the same assay?   Yes: if authors reported that all patients received a viral load using the same assay  No: if only a selection of those with adherence measures have viral load measures, or different assays were used.  Unclear: if authors provided insufficient information.      Did the study avoid inappropriate exclusions?   Yes: if there were no inappropriate exclusions.  No: if there was evidence that authors excluded certain patients with factors that might influence accuracy of measurement of adherence. Examples of inappropriate exclusions:  \u00b7 people with limited ability to use electronic monitoring devices, \u00b7 literacy concerns if self\u2010report measures were to be self\u2010administered \u00b7 comorbidities and comedication \u00b7 Viral non\u2010suppression at baseline Unclear: if authors provided insufficient information.    Prespecified threshold used?   Yes: if authors reported an a priori threshold value (or values) for adherence.  No: if authors determined threshold values post hoc.  Unclear: if authors provided insufficient information.    Reference standard results interpreted without knowledge of the index test?   Yes: if authors reported that viral loads were measured and recorded without a priori knowledge of the measure of adherence result.  No: if authors reported that viral load was measured or recorded with knowledge of the measure of adherence result.  Unclear: if authors provided insufficient information.
