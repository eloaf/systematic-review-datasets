    "title": "Case management for integrated care of older people with frailty in community settings",
    "abstract": "Background Ageing populations globally have contributed to increasing numbers of people living with frailty, which has significant implications for use of health and care services and costs. The British Geriatrics Society defines frailty as \"a distinctive health state related to the ageing process in which multiple body systems gradually lose their inbuilt reserves\". This leads to an increased susceptibility to adverse outcomes, such as reduced physical function, poorer quality of life, hospital admissions, and mortality. Case management interventions delivered in community settings are led by a health or social care professional, supported by a multidisciplinary team, and focus on the planning, provision, and co\u2010ordination of care to meet the needs of the individual. Case management is one model of integrated care that has gained traction with policymakers to improve outcomes for populations at high risk of decline in health and well\u2010being. These populations include older people living with frailty, who commonly have complex healthcare and social care needs but can experience poorly co\u2010ordinated care due to fragmented care systems.    Objectives To assess the effects of case management for integrated care of older people living with frailty compared with usual care.    Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Health Systems Evidence, and PDQ Evidence and databases from inception to 23 September 2022. We also searched clinical registries and relevant grey literature databases, checked references of included trials and relevant systematic reviews, conducted citation searching of included trials, and contacted topic experts.    Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared case management with standard care in community\u2010dwelling people aged 65 years and older living with frailty.    Data collection and analysis We followed standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane and the Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence.    Main results We included 20 trials (11,860 participants), all of which took place in high\u2010income countries. Case management interventions in the included trials varied in terms of organisation, delivery, setting, and care providers involved. Most trials included a variety of healthcare and social care professionals, including nurse practitioners, allied healthcare professionals, social workers, geriatricians, physicians, psychologists, and clinical pharmacists. In nine trials, the case management intervention was delivered by nurses only. Follow\u2010up ranged from three to 36 months. We judged most trials at unclear risk of selection and performance bias; this consideration, together with indirectness, justified downgrading the certainty of the evidence to low or moderate.  Case management compared to standard care may result in little or no difference in the following outcomes.  \u2022 Mortality at 12 months' follow\u2010up (7.0% in the intervention group versus 7.5% in the control group; risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.84 to 1.15; I2 = 11%; 14 trials, 9924 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence)\u2022 Change in place of residence to a nursing home at 12 months' follow\u2010up (9.9% in the intervention group versus 13.4% in the control group; RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.01; I2 = 0%; 4 trials, 1108 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence)\u2022 Quality of life at three to 24 months' follow\u2010up (results not pooled; mean differences (MDs) ranged from \u22126.32 points (95% CI \u221211.04 to \u22121.59) to 6.1 points (95% CI \u22123.92 to 16.12) when reported; 11 trials, 9284 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence)\u2022 Serious adverse effects at 12 to 24 months' follow\u2010up (results not pooled; 2 trials, 592 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence)\u2022 Change in physical function at three to 24 months' follow\u2010up (results not pooled; MDs ranged from \u22120.12 points (95% CI \u22120.93 to 0.68) to 3.4 points (95% CI \u22122.35 to 9.15) when reported; 16 trials, 10,652 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence)  Case management compared to standard care probably results in little or no difference in the following outcomes.  \u2022 Healthcare utilisation in terms of hospital admission at 12 months' follow\u2010up (32.7% in the intervention group versus 36.0% in the control group; RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.05; I2 = 43%; 6 trials, 2424 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence)\u2022 Change in costs at six to 36 months' follow\u2010up (results not pooled; 14 trials, 8486 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence), which usually included healthcare service costs, intervention costs, and other costs such as informal care.    Authors' conclusions We found uncertain evidence regarding whether case management for integrated care of older people with frailty in community settings, compared to standard care, improved patient and service outcomes or reduced costs. There is a need for further research to develop a clear taxonomy of intervention components, to determine the active ingredients that work in case management interventions, and identify how such interventions benefit some people and not others.",

        "Types of studies": "We included RCTs, of both individual and cluster design, that evaluated case management for integrated care of older people with frailty versus usual care. An initial scoping of the literature indicated sufficient numbers of RCTs to include in a meta\u2010analysis in this review. We included all trials, however old, conducted in high\u2010, middle\u2010 and low\u2010income countries. We included full\u2010text, peer\u2010reviewed publications, conference abstracts (with a view to identifying full trials), and unpublished data. We included trials irrespective of their publication status and language of publication. We excluded trials with non\u2010randomised designs (e.g. interrupted time series) or that used observational methods only.",
        "Types of participants": "We included men and women aged 65 years and older who met the following criteria. Identified as frail using criteria defined by trial authors   Living in a community setting (i.e. individuals living in their own home, retirement housing, or sheltered accommodation, but not those living in a nursing or residential home care setting)    Not medically unwell (i.e. not receiving acute medical care) Identified as frail using criteria defined by trial authors Living in a community setting (i.e. individuals living in their own home, retirement housing, or sheltered accommodation, but not those living in a nursing or residential home care setting) Not medically unwell (i.e. not receiving acute medical care) Two dominant models of frailty are the phenotypical model and the cumulative deficit model. The phenotypical model categorises frailty as a clinical syndrome, specifically meeting three or more of the following five criteria: weight loss, exhaustion, weak grip strength, slow walking speed, and low physical activity (Fried 2001). The cumulative deficit model conceptualises frailty as a multidimensional state, including physical, psychological, and social domains of function, using a proportion of health deficits from the number of problems assessed (Searle 2008). Frailty criteria used by trial authors could include validated measures based on one of the models mentioned above. We considered a population eligible with regard to frailty when the trial met one of the following criteria. The trial used a measure of frailty as an inclusion criterion (applicable to trials published since the early 2000s when frailty started to be defined and measured in research and practice)    There was no definition of frailty but trial authors described their population as frail or described the intervention as intended for older people with frailty, and the frailty of the population was supported with a measure of function or dependency as an inclusion criterion, with specified cut\u2010off points.    The trial did not use a cut\u2010off score, but the function or dependency baseline data suggested a frail cohort. We used published normative data to make these decisions and determine cut\u2010off points in the measures presented. Where these measures could be found in validated frailty indices, we used the cut\u2010off points established in those indices. Otherwise, we made decisions based on age\u2010matched normative data.

        "Types of interventions": "We included all trials that evaluated case management for integrated care of older people living with frailty versus usual care. Eligible interventions met the following criteria. Led by a single health or social care professional (e.g. a nurse, social worker, or allied healthcare professional) who had a role in care delivery for older people with frailty and complex needs, supported by a multidisciplinary team.    Focused on the planning, provision, and co\u2010ordination of healthcare and social care to meet the needs of the older person living with frailty.    Delivered in community care settings (excluding care homes) and not acute care settings, with no minimum or maximum follow\u2010up period to assess outcomes.    May include comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA), but only if a case management approach is applied to the CGA process. We excluded CGA without any structured follow\u2010up or a designated lead healthcare or social care professional. A case management approach to CGA would be indicated by:    planned and structured ongoing support after the initial assessment process;   a healthcare or social care professional leading the support; and   use of the support to plan, provide or co\u2010ordinate care.
