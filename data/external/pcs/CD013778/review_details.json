    "title": "Inspiratory muscle training, with or without concomitant pulmonary rehabilitation, for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)",
    "abstract": "Background Inspiratory muscle training (IMT)\u00a0aims to improve respiratory muscle strength and endurance.\u00a0Clinical trials used various training protocols,\u00a0devices and respiratory measurements to check the effectiveness of this intervention. The current guidelines reported a possible advantage of IMT, particularly in people with respiratory muscle weakness. However, it remains unclear to what extent IMT\u00a0is clinically beneficial, especially when associated with pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). \u00a0    Objectives To assess the effect of inspiratory muscle training (IMT) on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), as a stand\u2010alone intervention and when combined with pulmonary rehabilitation (PR).    Search methods We searched the Cochrane Airways trials register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) EBSCO, Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform on 20 October 2022.\u00a0We also checked reference lists of all primary studies and review articles.    Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared IMT in combination with PR versus PR alone and IMT versus control/sham.\u00a0We included different types of IMT irrespective of the mode of delivery.\u00a0We\u00a0excluded\u00a0trials that used\u00a0resistive devices without controlling the breathing pattern or a training load of less than 30% of maximal inspiratory pressure (PImax), or both.    Data collection and analysis We used standard methods recommended by Cochrane including assessment of risk of bias with RoB 2. Our primary outcomes were dyspnea, functional exercise capacity and health\u2010related quality of life.\u00a0    Main results We included 55 RCTs in this review. Both IMT and PR protocols varied significantly across the trials, especially in training duration, loads, devices, number/ frequency of sessions and the PR programs. Only eight trials were at low risk of bias.  PR+IMT versus PR  We included 22 trials (1446 participants) in this comparison. Based on a minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of \u22121 unit, we did not find an improvement in dyspnea assessed with the\u00a0Borg scale\u00a0at submaximal exercise capacity (mean difference (MD) 0.19, 95% confidence interval (CI) \u22120.42 to 0.79; 2 RCTs, 202 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). \u00a0  We also found no improvement in dyspnea assessed with the modified Medical Research Council dyspnea scale (mMRC) according to an MCID between \u22120.5 and \u22121 unit (MD \u22120.12, 95% CI \u22120.39 to 0.14; 2 RCTs, 204 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence).\u00a0  Pooling evidence for the\u00a06\u2010minute walk distance (6MWD)\u00a0showed\u00a0an increase of 5.95 meters\u00a0(95% CI \u22125.73\u00a0to 17.63; 12 RCTs, 1199 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence) and failed to reach the\u00a0MCID of 26 meters. In subgroup analysis, we divided the RCTs according to the training duration and mean baseline PImax. The test for subgroup differences was not significant. Trials at low risk of bias (n = 3) demonstrated a larger effect estimate than the overall.  The summary effect of the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) revealed an overall\u00a0total score below the MCID of 4 units (MD 0.13, 95% CI \u22120.93 to 1.20; 7 RCTs, 908 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence).\u00a0  The summary effect of COPD Assessment Test (CAT) did not show an improvement in the HRQoL (MD 0.13, 95% CI \u22120.80 to 1.06; 2 RCTs, 657 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence), according to an MCID of \u22121.6 units.\u00a0  Pooling the RCTs that reported PImax showed an increase of 11.46 cmH2O (95% CI 7.42 to 15.50; 17 RCTs, 1329 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence) but failed to reach the MCID of 17.2 cmH2O. \u00a0In subgroup analysis, we did not find a difference between different training durations and between studies judged with and without respiratory muscle weakness.\u00a0  One abstract reported some adverse effects that were considered \"minor and self\u2010limited\".  IMT versus control/sham  Thirty\u2010seven\u00a0RCTs with 1021 participants contributed to our second comparison. There was a trend towards an improvement when Borg was calculated\u00a0at submaximal exercise capacity\u00a0(MD \u22120.94, 95% CI \u22121.36 to \u22120.51; 6 RCTs, 144 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence). Only one trial was at a low risk of bias.  Eight studies (nine arms) used the Baseline Dyspnea Index \u2010 Transition Dyspnea Index (BDI\u2010TDI).\u00a0Based on an MCID of +1 unit, they\u00a0showed an improvement only with the 'total score' of the TDI (MD 2.98, 95% CI 2.07 to 3.89; 8 RCTs, 238 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence). We\u00a0did not find a difference between studies classified as with and without respiratory muscle weakness. Only one trial was at low risk of bias.  Four studies reported the mMRC, revealing a possible\u00a0improvement in dyspnea\u00a0in the IMT group\u00a0(MD \u22120.59, 95% CI \u22120.76 to \u22120.43; 4 RCTs, 150 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). Two trials were at low risk of bias.  Compared to control/sham, the MD in the 6MWD following IMT was 35.71 (95% CI 25.68\u00a0to 45.74; 16 RCTs, 501 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). Two studies were at low risk of bias. In subgroup analysis, we did not find a difference between different training durations and between studies judged with and without respiratory muscle weakness.\u00a0  Six studies reported the SGRQ total score, showing a larger effect in the IMT\u00a0group\u00a0(MD \u22123.85, 95% CI \u22128.18 to 0.48; 6 RCTs, 182 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence). The lower limit of the 95% CI exceeded the MCID of \u22124 units. Only one study was at low risk of bias.  There was an improvement in life quality with CAT (MD \u22122.97, 95% CI \u22123.85 to \u22122.10; 2 RCTs, 86 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). One trial was at low risk of bias.  Thirty\u2010two RCTs reported PImax, showing an improvement without reaching the MCID (MD 14.57 cmH2O, 95% CI 9.85 to 19.29; 32 RCTs, 916 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). In subgroup analysis, we did not find a difference between different training durations and between studies judged with and without respiratory muscle weakness. \u00a0  None of the included RCTs reported adverse events.    Authors' conclusions IMT may not\u00a0improve dyspnea, functional exercise capacity and life quality when associated with PR. However, IMT is likely to improve these outcomes when provided alone.  For both interventions, a larger effect in participants with respiratory muscle weakness and with longer training durations is still to be confirmed.",

        "Types of participants": "We\u00a0included people with COPD diagnosed according to international standards (GOLD 2022), at any stage of the disease.\u00a0We placed no restrictions\u00a0on age, duration, setting, or the kind of pulmonary rehabilitation. We planned to include\u00a0RCTs with different conditions for the same intervention of interest as long as we could obtain the data of participants with COPD separately.

        "Types of interventions": "The review\u00a0consists of two comparisons, as follows. IMT plus PR versus PR   IMT versus no treatment or sham IMT plus PR versus PR IMT versus no treatment or sham First, we\u00a0included trials that explored the benefit of combining IMT and PR compared to PR only. PR consists of, but is not limited to, exercise training, physiotherapy, therapeutic education, and nutritional and psychosocial care (McCarthy 2015). We included different types of IMT irrespective of the mode of delivery: resistance training (high load, low frequency) or endurance training (low load, high frequency), device (i.e. threshold loading, resistive flow device, isocapnic hyperpnea). We made\u00a0no restrictions on the duration, supervision (home\u2010based or in a healthcare setting), or timing (during hospitalization or later) of the intervention. We\u00a0excluded studies where the training was conducted only once\u00a0per week (face\u2010to\u2010face or distance sessions), regardless of the total duration of the clinical trial. The minimum accepted training load\u00a0was\u00a030% of PImax or more\u00a0(Hill 2010). We also excluded trials that used a resistive device without controlling the breathing pattern. If a study conducted an incremental\u00a0training load that started\u00a0less than 30% of PImax, we\u00a0considered only the follow\u2010up\u00a0from which the load was equal to our threshold. According to the proportion of supervised sessions, we defined supervision as: under 20%: unsupervised;\u00a0\u00a0   20% to 70%: partially supervised; and\u00a0\u00a0   above 70%: fully supervised. under 20%: unsupervised; 20% to 70%: partially supervised; and above 70%: fully supervised. For the second comparison, we compared IMT with control or sham. We defined sham training as using a resistance of less than 30% of PImax. We accepted control groups if they did not receive any intervention or received an intervention other than exercise training to blind participants\u00a0(e.g. therapeutic education). We made the exception for breathing exercises if participants in the control group did not receive more than one type of training (e.g. diaphragmatic breathing, pursed lips breathing), and the purpose was not to compare it with IMT.",
        "Types of outcome measures": "We analysed\u00a0the following outcomes in the review, but we did\u00a0not use them as a basis for including or excluding studies. Dyspnea: the essential scale for our primary analysis is the Borg scale (Borg 1982). We\u00a0only included the Borg score when it was measured at isotime. We analysed all the scales reported by the trials as long as they were validated, and when possible, we combined them in a meta\u2010analysis. The other\u00a0included scales were:\u00a0Baseline and Transition Dyspnea Indexes (BDI\u2010TDI) (Mahler 2005),\u00a0and Modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) (Bestall 1999). Functional exercise capacity: this can be assessed through multiple tests. We did not exclude studies based on the test used. However, for our analysis, we considered\u00a0that the most important measurement is the six\u2010minute walk distance (6MWD) (Holland 2014). Therefore, we included it in the summary of findings table and considered it for subgroup analysis. We included other tests and reported them either in qualitative or quantitative analysis. Health\u2010related quality of life: we accepted any scales as long as they were validated. This includes the\u00a0St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) (Jones 1992), the chronic respiratory questionnaire (CRQ) (Wijkstra 1994) and the COPD assessment test (CAT) (Jones 2009). Inspiratory muscle strength: measured by maximal static inspiratory mouth pressure (PImax) (Laveneziana 2019). Laboratory exercise tests: we were primarily interested in the maximal oxygen uptake (VO2peak), which could\u00a0be measured through: incremental cycle ergometer test;   endurance cycle ergometer test;   treadmill test. incremental cycle ergometer test; endurance cycle ergometer test; treadmill test. Respiratory muscle endurance: Respiratory muscle endurance pressure (Pthmax): measured by incremental load testing (Laveneziana 2019). It is the maximally tolerated pressure when breathing against a continuously increasing load.    Respiratory muscle endurance time (Tlim): measured by constant load testing (Laveneziana 2019). It is the time an individual can maintain breathing against a fixed load. It can be carried out either through a threshold/resistive or isocapnic hyperpnea device.    Maximal voluntary ventilation (MVV): this is the total volume of expired air between 12 seconds to 15 seconds of deep and fast respiration. MVV is usually compared to predicted MVV (calculated through the forced expiratory volume at 1 second) (Wood 2017).

Respiratory function: forced expiratory volume at 1 second (FEV1)   residual volume forced expiratory volume at 1 second (FEV1) residual volume Adverse events: as defined by the trial authors. We\u00a0collected outcomes irrespective of the time frame and summary statistics (change from baseline or final values), with a preference for change score. For each trial, we analysed only the\u00a0outcomes listed above and not all the outcomes reported in the trial. However, we included all the tests and measurements used for the same outcome.",
