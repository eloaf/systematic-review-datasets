    "title": "Pharmacological interventions for prophylaxis of vestibular migraine",
    "abstract": "Background Vestibular migraine is a form of migraine where one of the main features is recurrent attacks of vertigo. These episodes are often associated with other features of migraine, including headache and sensitivity to light or sound. These unpredictable and severe attacks of vertigo can lead to a considerable reduction in quality of life. The condition is estimated to affect just under 1% of the population, although many people remain undiagnosed. A number of pharmacological interventions have been used or proposed to be used as prophylaxis for this condition, to help reduce the frequency of the attacks. These are predominantly based on treatments that are in use for headache migraine, with the belief that the underlying pathophysiology of these conditions is similar.\u00a0    Objectives To assess the benefits and harms of pharmacological treatments used for prophylaxis of vestibular migraine.    Search methods The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 23 September 2022.    Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi\u2010RCTs in adults with definite or probable vestibular migraine comparing beta\u2010blockers, calcium channel blockers, antiepileptics, antidepressants, diuretics, monoclonal antibodies against calcitonin gene\u2010related peptide (or its receptor), botulinum toxin or hormonal modification with either placebo or no treatment. We excluded studies with a cross\u2010over design, unless data from the first phase of the study could be identified.\u00a0    Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were: 1) improvement in vertigo (assessed as a dichotomous outcome \u2010 improved or not improved), 2) change in vertigo (assessed as a continuous outcome, with a score on a numerical scale) and 3) serious adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were: 4) disease\u2010specific health\u2010related quality of life, 5) improvement in headache, 6) improvement in other migrainous symptoms and 7) other adverse effects. We considered outcomes reported at three time points: < 3 months, 3 to < 6 months, > 6 to 12 months. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.\u00a0    Main results We included three studies with a total of 209 participants. One evaluated beta\u2010blockers and the other two evaluated calcium channel blockers. We did not identify any evidence for the remaining interventions of interest.\u00a0  Beta\u2010blockers versus placebo  One study (including 130 participants, 61% female) evaluated the use of 95 mg metoprolol once daily for six months, compared to placebo. The proportion of people who reported improvement in vertigo was not assessed in this study. Some data were reported on the frequency of vertigo attacks at six months and the occurrence of serious adverse effects. However, this is a single, small study and for all outcomes the certainty of evidence was low or very low. We are unable to draw meaningful conclusions from the numerical results.  Calcium channel blockers versus no treatment  Two studies, which included a total of 79 participants (72% female), assessed the use of 10 mg flunarizine once daily for three months, compared to no intervention. All of the evidence for this comparison was of very low certainty. Most of our outcomes were only reported by a single study, therefore we were unable to conduct any meta\u2010analysis. Some data were reported on improvement in vertigo and change in vertigo, but no information was available regarding serious adverse events. We are unable to draw meaningful conclusions from the numerical results, as these data come from single, small studies and the certainty of the evidence was very low.\u00a0    Authors' conclusions There is very limited evidence from placebo\u2010controlled randomised trials regarding the efficacy and potential harms of pharmacological interventions for prophylaxis of vestibular migraine. We only identified evidence for two of our interventions of interest (beta\u2010blockers and calcium channel blockers) and all evidence was of low or very low certainty. Further research is necessary to identify whether these treatments are effective at improving symptoms and whether there are any harms associated with their use.",

        "Types of studies": "We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi\u2010randomised trials (where trials were designed as RCTs, but the sequence generation for allocation of treatment used methods such as alternate allocation, birth dates etc). The number of episodes of vestibular migraine may vary with time \u2010 patients sometimes have periods of more active disease, followed by a period of fewer attacks. Therefore cross\u2010over trials are not an appropriate study design when assessing prophylaxis for this condition. Cross\u2010over RCTs would only have been included if data could be extracted for the first phase of the study. If cluster\u2010RCTs were identified then they would have been eligible for inclusion, providing we could appropriately account for the clustering in the data analysis (according to methods described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions)\u00a0(Handbook 2021). However, we did not identify any cross\u2010over or cluster\u2010randomised trials for this review.",
        "Types of participants": "We included studies that recruited participants with a diagnosis of vestibular migraine, according to the International Headache Society (IHS) and B\u00e1r\u00e1ny Society criteria (see\u00a0Appendix 1). We also included studies that used other, established criteria, for example\u00a0Neuhauser 2001. We included studies where participants were diagnosed with either 'definite' vestibular migraine or 'probable' vestibular migraine. Where studies recruited participants with a variety of diagnoses (e.g. vestibular migraine and headache migraine) we planned to include the study if either: the majority of participants (\u2265 90%) had a diagnosis of vestibular migraine; or   subgroup data were available that allowed us to identify data specifically from those with vestibular migraine. the majority of participants (\u2265 90%) had a diagnosis of vestibular migraine; or subgroup data were available that allowed us to identify data specifically from those with vestibular migraine. However, we did not identify any studies that included participants with headache migraine.",
        "Types of interventions": "We included the following interventions: beta\u2010blockers;   calcium channel blockers;   antiepileptics;   antidepressants;   diuretics;   monoclonal antibodies to CGRP or its receptor;   botulinum toxin;   hormonal modification. beta\u2010blockers; calcium channel blockers; antiepileptics; antidepressants; diuretics; monoclonal antibodies to CGRP or its receptor; botulinum toxin; hormonal modification.

There were no limits on the type of concurrent treatments used, providing these were used equally in each arm of the study. We planned to pool studies that included concurrent treatments with those where participants did not receive concurrent treatment, and to conduct subgroup analysis to determine whether the effect estimates may be different in those receiving additional treatment.",

The exception was for adverse event data, when we used the longest time period of follow\u2010up. We searched the COMET database for existing core outcome sets of relevance to vestibular migraine and vertigo, but were unable to find any published core outcome sets. We therefore conducted a survey of individuals with experience of (or an interest in) balance disorders to help identify outcomes that should be prioritised. The results of this survey were used by the review author team to inform the choice of outcome measures in this review. We analysed the following outcomes in the review (but we did not use them as a basis for including or excluding studies). Improvement in vertigo   Measured as a dichotomous outcome (improved/not improved), according to self\u2010report, or according to a change of a specified score (as described by the study authors) on a vertigo rating scale.      Change in vertigo   Measured as a continuous outcome, to identify the extent of change in vertigo symptoms.     Serious adverse events   Including any event that caused death, was life\u2010threatening, required hospitalisation, resulted in disability or permanent damage, or in congenital abnormality. Measured as the number of participants who experienced at least one serious adverse event during the follow\u2010up period.

Measured as the number of participants who experienced at least one serious adverse event during the follow\u2010up period. Vertigo symptoms comprise a variety of different features, including frequency of episodes, duration of episodes and severity/intensity of the episodes. Where possible, we included data for the vertigo outcomes that encompassed all of these three aspects (frequency, duration and severity/intensity of symptoms). However, we anticipated that these data may not be available from all studies. If they were unavailable, then we extracted data on the frequency of vertigo episodes as an alternative measure for these outcomes.

It includes a set of predefined criteria to select studies that, based on available information, are deemed to be sufficiently trustworthy to be included in the analysis. These criteria are:  Research governance     Are there any retraction notices or expressions of concern listed on the Retraction Watch Database relating to this study?    Was the study prospectively registered (for those studies published after 2010)? If not, was there a plausible reason?    When requested, did the trial authors provide/share the protocol and/or ethics approval letter?    Did the trial authors engage in communication with the Cochrane Review authors within the agreed timelines?    Did the trial authors provide IPD data upon request? If not, was there a plausible reason?     Baseline characteristics     Is the study free from characteristics of the study participants that appear too similar (e.g. distribution of the mean (SD) excessively narrow or excessively wide, as noted by\u00a0Carlisle 2017)?     Feasibility     Is the study free from characteristics that could be implausible? (e.g. large numbers of women with a rare condition (such as severe cholestasis in pregnancy) recruited within 12 months);    In cases with (close to) zero losses to follow\u2010up, is there a plausible explanation?    Results     Is the study free from results that could be implausible? (e.g. massive risk reduction for main outcomes with small sample size)?    Do the numbers randomised to each group suggest that adequate randomisation methods were used (e.g. is the study free from issues such as unexpectedly even numbers of women \u2018randomised\u2019 including a mismatch between the numbers and the methods, if the authors say \u2018no blocking was used\u2019 but still end up with equal numbers, or if the authors say they used \u2018blocks of 4\u2019 but the final numbers differ by 6)?     Studies assessed as being potentially \u2018high risk\u2019 will be not be included in the review. Where a study is classified as \u2018high risk\u2019 for one or more of the above criteria we will attempt to contact the study authors to address any possible lack of information/concerns. If adequate information remains unavailable, the study will remain in \u2018awaiting classification\u2019 and the reasons and communications with the author (or lack of) described in detail.
