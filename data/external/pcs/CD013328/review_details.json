    "title": "Interventions to improve sanitation for preventing diarrhoea",
    "abstract": "Background Diarrhoea is a major contributor to the global disease burden, particularly amongst children under five years in low\u2010 and middle\u2010income countries (LMICs). As many of the infectious agents associated with diarrhoea are transmitted through faeces, sanitation interventions to safely contain and manage human faeces have the potential to reduce exposure and diarrhoeal disease.    Objectives To assess the effectiveness of sanitation interventions for preventing diarrhoeal disease, alone or in combination with other WASH interventions.    Search methods We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and Chinese language databases available under the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI\u2010CAJ). We also searched the meta Register of Controlled Trials (mRCT) and conference proceedings, contacted researchers, and searched references of included studies. The last search date was 16 February 2022.    Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi\u2010RCTs, non\u2010randomized controlled trials (NRCTs), controlled before\u2010and\u2010after studies (CBAs), and matched cohort studies of interventions aimed at introducing or expanding the coverage and/or use of sanitation facilities in children and adults in any country or population. Our primary outcome of interest was diarrhoea and secondary outcomes included dysentery (bloody diarrhoea), persistent diarrhoea, hospital or clinical visits for diarrhoea, mortality, and adverse events. We included sanitation interventions whether they were conducted independently or in combination with other interventions.    Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed eligible studies, extracted relevant data, assessed risk of bias, and assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. We used meta\u2010analyses to estimate pooled measures of effect, described results narratively, and investigated potential sources of heterogeneity using subgroup analyses.    Main results Fifty\u2010one studies met our inclusion criteria, with a total of 238,535 participants. Of these, 50 studies had sufficient information to be included in quantitative meta\u2010analysis, including 17 cluster\u2010RCTs and 33 studies with non\u2010randomized study designs (20 NRCTs, one CBA, and 12 matched cohort studies). Most were conducted in LMICs and 86% were conducted in whole or part in rural areas. Studies covered three broad types of interventions: (1) providing access to any sanitation facility to participants without existing access practising open defecation, (2) improving participants' existing sanitation facility, or (3) behaviour change messaging to improve sanitation access or practices without providing hardware or subsidy, although many studies overlapped multiple categories. There was substantial heterogeneity amongst individual study results for all types of interventions.  Providing access to any sanitation facility  Providing access to sanitation facilities was evaluated in seven cluster\u2010RCTs, and may reduce diarrhoea prevalence in all age groups (risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 1.08; 7 trials, 40,129 participants, low\u2010certainty evidence). In children under five years, access may have little or no effect on diarrhoea prevalence (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.16, 4 trials, 16,215 participants, low\u2010certainty evidence). Additional analysis in non\u2010randomized studies was generally consistent with these findings. Pooled estimates across randomized and non\u2010randomized studies provided similar protective estimates (all ages: RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.94; 15 studies, 73,511 participants; children < 5 years: RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.02; 11 studies, 25,614 participants).\u00a0  Sanitation facility improvement  Interventions designed to improve existing sanitation facilities were evaluated in three cluster\u2010RCTs in children under five and may reduce diarrhoea prevalence (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.06; 3 trials, 14,900 participants, low\u2010certainty evidence). However, some of these interventions, such as sewerage connection, are not easily randomized. Non\u2010randomized studies across participants of all ages provided estimates that improving sanitation facilities may reduce diarrhoea, but may be subject to confounding (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.74; 23 studies, 117,639 participants, low\u2010certainty evidence). Pooled estimates across randomized and non\u2010randomized studies provided similar protective estimates (all ages: RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.78; 26 studies, 132,539 participants; children < 5 years: RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.91, 12 studies, 23,353 participants).\u00a0  Behaviour change messaging only (no hardware or subsidy provided)  Strategies to promote behaviour change to construct, upgrade, or use sanitation facilities were evaluated in seven cluster\u2010RCTs in children under five, and probably reduce diarrhoea prevalence (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.98; 7 studies, 28,909 participants, moderate\u2010certainty evidence). Additional analysis from two non\u2010randomized studies found no effect, though with very high uncertainty. Pooled estimates across randomized and non\u2010randomized studies provided similar protective estimates (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.01; 9 studies, 31,080 participants). No studies measured the effects of this type of intervention in older populations.\u00a0  Any sanitation intervention  A pooled analysis of cluster\u2010RCTs across all sanitation interventions demonstrated that the interventions may reduce diarrhoea prevalence in all ages (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.95, 17 trials, 83,938 participants, low\u2010certainty evidence) and children under five (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.97; 14 trials, 60,024 participants, low\u2010certainty evidence). Non\u2010randomized comparisons also demonstrated a protective effect, but may be subject to confounding. Pooled estimates across randomized and non\u2010randomized studies provided similar protective estimates (all ages: RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.82; 50 studies, 237,130 participants; children < 5 years: RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.89; 32 studies, 80,047 participants). In subgroup analysis, there was some evidence of larger effects in studies with increased coverage amongst all participants (75% or higher coverage levels) and also some evidence that the effect decreased over longer follow\u2010up times for children under five years.  There was limited evidence on other outcomes. However, there was some evidence that any sanitation intervention was protective against dysentery (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.00; 5 studies, 34,025 participants) and persistent diarrhoea (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.75; 2 studies, 2665 participants), but not against clinic visits for diarrhoea (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.67; 2 studies, 3720 participants) or all\u2010cause mortality (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.89 to1.09; 7 studies, 46,123 participants).    Authors' conclusions There is evidence that sanitation interventions are effective at preventing diarrhoea, both for young children and all age populations. The actual level of effectiveness, however, varies by type of intervention and setting. There is a need for research to better understand the factors that influence effectiveness.",

        "Types of studies": "We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi\u2010RCTs, non\u2010randomized controlled trials (NRCTs), controlled before\u2010and\u2010after studies (CBAs), and matched cohort studies. For randomized trials, we included studies with a unit of randomization of individuals, families, households, villages, communities, or other clusters. For cluster\u2010RCTs, we only included studies that had at least two clusters per arm. For CBAs, we only included studies that had at least two sites per arm and contemporaneous data collection in the intervention and control arms. For matched cohort studies, we only included studies that had at least two sites per arm. A matched cohort study is a rigorous observational study method that allows for causal inference to be assessed from a non\u2010randomized pre\u2010existing development intervention implemented at a group or community level (Arnold 2010). A quasi\u2010RCT refers to a controlled trial that uses a method of participant allocation that is not truly random, but that is intended to produce similar groups as randomization (for example, allocation by date of birth, medical record number, or every other person) (Cochrane Community 2018). We used Cochrane EPOC's definitions of NRCTs and CBAs to differentiate between the two study design types, with both types of studies including an intervention study with a control and intervention group that is non\u2010randomized and measures outcomes in both groups after (and sometimes before) the intervention (Cochrane EPOC 2019). However, if allocation of the intervention to control and intervention groups was made by the investigators, then we classified it as a NRCT and if allocation to control and intervention groups was not under the control of the investigator, then we classified it as a CBA. If the study did not report who allocated the intervention to control and intervention groups, we classified the study as a NRCT. In this review, we expanded the inclusion criteria of\u00a0Clasen 2010\u00a0to include controlled before\u2010and\u2010after and matched cohort studies, two types of relatively rigorous non\u2010randomized study designs. The inclusion of rigorous non\u2010randomized studies of sanitation interventions enables the review to address important interventions that are not readily randomized, such as municipal sewerage and other downstream measures to manage faecal sludge beyond the user interface. The differences they present from RCTs in terms of causal inference can be adequately managed by subgroup analysis and risk of bias assessment.",

        "Types of interventions": "The interventions relevant to this review are aimed at introducing or expanding the coverage and/or use of sanitation facilities designed to reduce direct or indirect contact with human faeces. Our systematic review evaluated the following three separate types of sanitation interventions. Providing access to any sanitation facility: interventions that provide participants who do not have access to a sanitation facility with access to some kind of sanitation facility. This includes constructing or subsidizing the construction of facilities for participants who practise open defecation.    Sanitation facility improvement: interventions that improve participants\u2019 existing sanitation facility. This may include upgrading access to a higher level of service (as defined by JMP for SDGs monitoring), although this upgrade is not necessary for the intervention to be classified as a sanitation facility improvement. Additionally, this may include interventions that encourage the building of new facilities including pit latrines, VIP latrines, composting toilets, and water\u2010sealed flush or pour\u2010flush toilets, as long as the facility is an improvement over the existing facility. It may also include interventions to promote the safe management of faecal sludge, such as pit emptying, sewerage connection, and composting or other treatment that could upgrade the sanitation level of service. This also includes providing individual household latrines to participants relying on shared sanitation.    Behaviour change messaging only: behaviour change interventions that encourage participants to increase sanitation access or improve the use of existing sanitation facilities without providing or improving facilities or providing subsidies for the same. However, these interventions may still include messaging to encourage participants to build a latrine for themselves or upgrade their existing latrine with their own funds or labour.

However, these interventions may still include messaging to encourage participants to build a latrine for themselves or upgrade their existing latrine with their own funds or labour. As many sanitation interventions fell into multiple categories (for example, providing new latrine access in some intervention households that had previously been open defecating while also improving latrines in other intervention households that already had access to a sanitation facility), we also included a final comparison in our meta\u2010analysis that includes any of the foregoing interventions. We also assigned these studies to one of the above three categories for our meta\u2010analysis by sanitation intervention type based on what we assessed to be the primary sanitation intervention. If the intervention included components of providing new latrine access to some households and improving existing latrines of other households, we assigned it to the infrastructure category which most households fell into. If the intervention included infrastructure and behaviour change components, we assigned the study to the relevant infrastructure category. We included sanitation interventions whether they were conducted independently or in combination with other interventions, such as interventions to improve water quality, water quantity or access, hygiene practices, and/or child nutrition. We encountered some studies with multiple intervention groups, such as studies with one arm receiving a sanitation intervention and another arm receiving a sanitation intervention coupled with water and hygiene interventions, with each compared to the same control arm. In such cases, we extracted the data comparing the sanitation\u2010only arm to the control arm to include in our analysis of sanitation\u2010only interventions, and extracted the data comparing the combined water, sanitation, and hygiene arm to the control arm to include in our analysis of combined sanitation intervention with water and/or hygiene interventions. We excluded interventions aimed solely at the safe disposal of child faeces, such as the promotion of potties, unless safe disposal of child faeces was part of a larger sanitation intervention covering adults and children. We also excluded interventions aimed solely at the containment of animal faeces. Although faeces from young children and animals may be important sources of exposure to faecal pathogens capable of infecting humans, other reviews focus specifically on the disposal of faeces from children (Majorin 2019) and animals (Penakalapati 2017). Finally, this review did not extend to interventions that are not aimed principally at the sanitary disposal and management of human faeces, thus it does not include efforts to promote the use of human waste in agricultural applications, or efforts to improve drainage, recycling or reuse of wastewater or stormwater, or management of solid waste. Study participants who practise open defecation or who continue to follow their current practices with respect to excreta disposal or faecal sludge management rather than the prescribed intervention. We excluded any controls that received a separate intervention to reduce diarrhoea that was not also introduced to the intervention arm. However, we included controls that received a separate intervention to reduce diarrhoea if that intervention was also introduced into the intervention group alongside the sanitation intervention.",
