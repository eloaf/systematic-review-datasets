    "title": "Drugs to reduce bleeding and transfusion in major open vascular or endovascular surgery: a systematic review and network meta\u2010analysis",
    "abstract": "Background Vascular surgery may be followed by internal bleeding due to inadequate surgical haemostasis, abnormal clotting, or surgical complications. Bleeding ranges from minor, with no transfusion requirement, to massive, requiring multiple blood product transfusions. There are a number of drugs, given systemically or applied locally, which may reduce the need for blood transfusion.    Objectives To assess the effectiveness and safety of anti\u2010fibrinolytic and haemostatic drugs and agents in reducing bleeding and the need for blood transfusion in people undergoing major vascular surgery or vascular procedures with a risk of moderate or severe (> 500 mL) blood loss.    Search methods We searched: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; MEDLINE; Embase; CINAHL, and Transfusion Evidence Library. We also searched the WHO ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov trial registries for ongoing and unpublished trials. Searches used a combination of MeSH and free text terms from database inception to 31 March 2022, without restriction on language or publication status.    Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in adults of drug treatments to reduce bleeding due to major vascular surgery or vascular procedures with a risk of moderate or severe blood loss, which used placebo, usual care or another drug regimen as control.    Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were units of red cells transfused and all\u2010cause mortality. Our secondary outcomes included risk of receiving an allogeneic blood product, risk of reoperation or repeat procedure due to bleeding, risk of a thromboembolic event, risk of a serious adverse event and length of hospital stay. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence.    Main results We included 22 RCTs with 3393 participants analysed, of which one RCT with 69 participants was reported only in abstract form, with no usable data. Seven RCTs evaluated systemic drug treatments (three aprotinin, two desmopressin, two tranexamic acid) and 15 RCTs evaluated topical drug treatments (drug\u2010containing bioabsorbable dressings or glues), including fibrin, thrombin, collagen, gelatin, synthetic sealants and one investigational new agent. Most trials were conducted in high\u2010income countries and the majority of the trials only included participants undergoing elective surgery. We also identified two ongoing RCTs.  We were unable to perform the planned network meta\u2010analysis due to the sparse reporting of outcomes relevant to this review.  Systemic drug treatments  We identified seven trials of three systemic drugs: aprotinin, desmopressin and tranexamic acid, all with placebo controls. The trials of aprotinin and desmopressin were small with very low\u2010certainty evidence for all of our outcomes. Tranexamic acid versus placebo was the systemic drug comparison with the largest number of participants (2 trials; 1460 participants), both at low risk of bias. The largest of these included a total of 9535 individuals undergoing a number of different higher risk surgeries and reported limited information on the vascular subgroup (1399 participants).  Neither trial reported the number of units of red cells transfused per participant up to 30 days. Three outcomes were associated with very low\u2010certainty evidence due to the very wide confidence intervals (CIs) resulting from small study sizes and low number of events. These were: all\u2010cause mortality up to 30 days; number of participants requiring an allogeneic blood transfusion up to 30 days; and risk of requiring a repeat procedure or operation due to bleeding.  Tranexamic acid may have no effect on the risk of thromboembolic events up to 30 days (risk ratio (RR) 1.10, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.36; 1 trial, 1360 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence due to imprecision).  There is one large ongoing trial (8320 participants) comparing tranexamic acid versus placebo in people undergoing non\u2010cardiac surgery who are at high risk of requiring a red cell transfusion. This aims to complete recruitment in April 2023. This trial has primary outcomes of proportion of participants transfused with red blood cells and incidence of venous thromboembolism (DVT or PE).  Topical drug treatments  Most trials of topical drug treatments were at high risk of bias due to their open\u2010label design (compared with usual care, or liquids were compared with sponges). All of the trials were small, most were very small, and few reported clinically relevant outcomes in the postoperative period. Fibrin sealant versus usual care was the topical drug comparison with the largest number of participants (5 trials, 784 participants).  The five trials that compared fibrin sealant with usual care were all at high risk of bias, due to the open\u2010label trial design with no measures put in place to minimise reporting bias. All of the trials were funded by pharmaceutical companies.  None of the five trials reported the number of red cells transfused per participant up to 30 days or the number of participants requiring an allogeneic blood transfusion up to 30 days.  The other three outcomes were associated with very low\u2010certainty evidence with wide confidence intervals due to small sample sizes and the low number of events, these were: all\u2010cause mortality up to 30 days; risk of requiring a repeat procedure due to bleeding; and risk of thromboembolic disease up to 30 days.  We identified one large trial (500 participants) comparing fibrin sealant versus usual care in participants undergoing abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, which has not yet started recruitment. This trial lists death due to arterial disease and reintervention rates as primary outcomes.    Authors' conclusions Because of a lack of data, we are uncertain whether any systemic or topical treatments used to reduce bleeding due to major vascular surgery have an effect on: all\u2010cause mortality up to 30 days; risk of requiring a repeat procedure or operation due to bleeding; number of red cells transfused per participant up to 30 days or the number of participants requiring an allogeneic blood transfusion up to 30 days.  There may be no effect of tranexamic acid on the risk of thromboembolic events up to 30 days, this is important as there has been concern that this risk may be increased.  Trials with sample size targets of thousands of participants and clinically relevant outcomes are needed, and we look forward to seeing the results of the ongoing trials in the future.",

        "Types of studies": "We prespecified our methods for conducting this review in the review protocol (Beverly 2020). We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster\u2010RCTs if the analyses accounted for clustering, or if we were able to adequately adjust for clustering (McKenzie 2016). We included all studies regardless of their language or publication status. We excluded studies with purely experimental laboratory outcomes (for example blood tests for inflammatory markers).",
        "Types of participants": "We included adults (18 years or over) undergoing the following emergency, urgent and elective procedures. Open surgical repair (OSR) of aneurysm of the:   abdominal aorta (AAA);   thoracic aorta (TAA);   thoraco\u2010abdominal aorta (TAAA);   iliac artery;   femoral artery; or   popliteal artery.

Open bypass surgery for peripheral arterial disease of the:   aortic artery;   iliac artery;   femoral artery; or   popliteal artery.     Major lower limb amputation for vascular disease:   below knee;   above knee; or   hindquarter. Open surgical repair (OSR) of aneurysm of the: abdominal aorta (AAA); thoracic aorta (TAA); thoraco\u2010abdominal aorta (TAAA); iliac artery; femoral artery; or popliteal artery. OSR or endovascular repair of dissection of the: abdominal aorta; thoracic aorta; or thoraco\u2010abdominal aorta. Open bypass surgery for peripheral arterial disease of the: aortic artery; iliac artery; femoral artery; or popliteal artery. Major lower limb amputation for vascular disease: below knee; above knee; or hindquarter. We included adults (18 years or over) undergoing the following emergency or urgent procedures. Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) of the:   abdominal aorta (AAA);   thoracic aorta (TAA);   thoraco\u2010abdominal aorta (TAAA);   iliac artery;   femoral artery; or   popliteal artery.

Endovascular stenting for peripheral arterial disease of the: aortic artery; iliac artery; femoral artery; or popliteal artery We included participants undergoing surgery with or without aortic cross clamping and with or without use of hypothermia. We included participants undergoing open, modifications of open, and minimally invasive, e.g. laparoscopic, surgical approaches. We excluded procedures typically performed by or in conjunction with cardiac surgeons, such as those on the ascending aorta and aortic root, or those using coronary artery bypass grafting. These are the topic of a separate ongoing Cochrane Review entitled Drugs to reduce bleeding and transfusion in adults undergoing cardiac surgery; a systematic review and network meta\u2010analysis (Beverly 2019). We excluded studies involving elective endovascular procedures. We excluded procedures associated with minimal bleeding and transfusion, such as carotid procedures, arterio\u2010venous fistulae formation for dialysis, varicose vein surgery and upper limb or digit amputations. We also excluded procedures typically performed by neurosurgeons, such as repair of aneurysms or dissection of arteries in the head or neck. We excluded people with known inherited coagulation disorders, such as von Willebrand factor deficiency, haemophilia or hypofibrinogenaemia. This is because the clotting mechanisms that the drugs promote or interact with may be genetically absent, making response atypical. For trials consisting of mixed populations of participants (e.g. including children, or including procedures other than those specified), we only used data from participants 18 years or over undergoing the specified procedures, without clotting disorders. If the subgroup data required were not provided, we excluded the trial if less than 80% of participants were eligible to be included.",
        "Types of interventions": "We included RCTs of the following interventions, compared to usual care, placebo, or each other.

We included RCTs that compared one or more of the interventions listed above. We included studies using a combination of the above drugs. We did not exclude trials on the basis of the route, dose, timing, or frequency of drug administration. The comparison groups were as defined by the study, which could be a control group using placebo, standard care, or one of the included drugs, if a second additional drug was being investigated.",
        "Types of outcome measures": "We were primarily interested in postsurgical outcomes, and especially the need for blood transfusion. We did not include intraoperative outcomes, such as time to haemostasis, because these outcomes are prone to measurement bias and are of limited clinical relevance or interest to health services. Our primary outcomes were: Red cell transfusions (units per participant*) at up to 30 days post surgery   All\u2010cause mortality at up to 30 days; and between 31 and 90 days Red cell transfusions (units per participant*) at up to 30 days post surgery All\u2010cause mortality at up to 30 days; and between 31 and 90 days *If the red cell transfusion outcome was reported in mL, we converted that into units, according to any local mean unit volume data given in the study, or as per the Guidelines for the Blood Transfusion Services in the UK mean stated volume per unit of red cells of 280 \u00b1 60 mLs (JPAC 2013). Our secondary outcomes were as follows. Risk of receiving any allogeneic blood product at up to 30 days post surgery   Composite: packed red cells (PRC), fresh frozen plasma (FFP), platelets (PLTs)   Components: PRC, FFP, PLTs     Risk of reoperation or repeat procedure for bleeding within 7 days   Risk of a thrombotic/thromboembolic event   Composite: myocardial Infarction (MI), cerebrovascular attack (CVA), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolus (PE) at up to 30 days and between 31 and 90 days    Components: MI at up to 30 days, CVA at up to 30 days, DVT at up to 90 days, PE at up to 90 days      Risk of a serious adverse event (SAE) at up to 30 days postsurgery   Length of hospital stay (days) Risk of receiving any allogeneic blood product at up to 30 days post surgery Composite: packed red cells (PRC), fresh frozen plasma (FFP), platelets (PLTs) Components: PRC, FFP, PLTs Risk of reoperation or repeat procedure for bleeding within 7 days Risk of a thrombotic/thromboembolic event Composite: myocardial Infarction (MI), cerebrovascular attack (CVA), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolus (PE) at up to 30 days and between 31 and 90 days Components: MI at up to 30 days, CVA at up to 30 days, DVT at up to 90 days, PE at up to 90 days Risk of a serious adverse event (SAE) at up to 30 days postsurgery Length of hospital stay (days) We commented on any cost data, if presented, in a narrative form (Ryan 2016). Cost information was provided as useful additional information, but was not intended to be a formal economic evaluation.",
