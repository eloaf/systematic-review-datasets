    "title": "Experiences of conditional and unconditional cash transfers intended for improving health outcomes and health service use: a qualitative evidence synthesis",
    "abstract": "Background It is well known that poverty is associated with ill health and that ill health can result in direct and indirect costs that can perpetuate poverty. Social protection, which includes policies and programmes intended to prevent and reduce poverty in times of ill health, could be one way to break this vicious cycle. Social protection, particularly cash transfers, also has the potential to promote healthier behaviours, including healthcare seeking. Although social protection, particularly conditional and unconditional cash transfers, has been widely studied, it is not well known how recipients experience social protection interventions, and what unintended effects such interventions can cause.\u00a0\u00a0    Objectives The aim of this review was to explore how conditional and unconditional cash transfer social protection interventions with a health outcome are experienced and perceived by their recipients.\u00a0    Search methods We searched Epistemonikos, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Social Services Abstracts, Global Index Medicus, Scopus, AnthroSource and EconLit from the start of the database to 5 June 2020. We combined this with reference checking, citation searching, grey literature and contact with authors to identify additional studies.\u00a0We reran all strategies in July 2022, and the new studies are awaiting classification.    Selection criteria We included primary studies, using qualitative methods or mixed\u2010methods studies with qualitative research reporting on recipients\u2019 experiences of cash transfer interventions where health outcomes were evaluated. Recipients could be adult patients of healthcare services, the general adult population as recipients of cash targeted at themselves or directed at children. Studies could be evaluated on any mental or physical health condition or cash transfer mechanism. Studies could come from any country and be in any language. Two authors independently selected studies.\u00a0    Data collection and analysis We used a multistep purposive sampling framework for selecting studies, starting with geographical representation, followed by health condition, and richness of data. Key data were extracted by the authors into Excel. Methodological limitations were assessed independently using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) criteria by two authors. Data were synthesised using meta\u2010ethnography, and confidence in findings was assessed using the Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research (GRADE\u2010CERQual) approach.\u00a0    Main results We included 127 studies in the review and sampled 41 of these studies for our analysis. Thirty\u2010two further studies were found after the updated search on 5 July 2022 and are awaiting classification. The sampled studies were from 24 different countries: 17 studies were from the African region, seven were from the region of the Americas, seven were from the European region, six were from the South\u2010East Asian region, three from the Western Pacific region and one study was multiregional, covering both the African and the Eastern Mediterranean regions. These studies primarily explored the views and experiences of cash transfer recipients with different health conditions, such as infectious diseases, disabilities and long\u2010term illnesses, sexual and reproductive health, and maternal and child health. Our GRADE\u2010CERQual assessment indicated we had mainly moderate\u2010 and high\u2010confidence findings. We found that recipients perceived the cash transfers as necessary and helpful for immediate needs and, in some cases, helpful for longer\u2010term benefits. However, across conditional and unconditional programmes, recipients often felt that the amount given was too little in relation to their total needs. They also felt that the cash alone was not enough to change their behaviour and, to change behaviour, additional types of support would be required. The cash transfer was reported to have important effects on empowerment, autonomy and agency, but also in some settings, recipients experienced pressure from family or programme staff on cash usage. The cash transfer was reported to improve social cohesion and reduce intrahousehold tension. However, in settings where some received the cash and others did not, the lack of an equal approach caused tension, suspicion and conflict. Recipients also reported stigma in terms of cash transfer programme assessment processes and eligibility, as well as inappropriate eligibility processes. Across settings, recipients experienced barriers in accessing the cash transfer programme, and some refused or were hesitant to receive the cash. Some recipients found cash transfer programmes more acceptable when they agreed with the programme's goals and processes.\u00a0\u00a0    Authors' conclusions Our findings highlight the impact of the sociocultural context on the functioning and interaction between the individual, family and cash transfer programmes. Even where the goals of a cash transfer programme are explicitly health\u2010related, the outcomes may be far broader than health alone and may include, for example, reduced stigma, empowerment and increased agency of the individual. When measuring programme outcomes, therefore, these broader impacts could be considered for understanding the health and well\u2010being benefits of cash transfers.",

        "Types of studies": "We included primary studies that used qualitative or mixed\u2010methods study designs. The qualitative designs in this study included different qualitative study approaches, including ethnography, phenomenology, case studies, generic descriptive qualitative studies and qualitative process evaluations. We included studies that used qualitative methods for data collection (including focus group discussions, semistructured and in\u2010depth individual interviews, observation and open\u2010ended web surveys) and that used qualitative methods for data analysis (including thematic analysis, grounded theory, framework analysis, and content analysis). We excluded studies that collected data qualitatively but analysed them using quantitative methods (e.g. open\u2010ended survey questions where the response data are analysed using descriptive statistics only), as qualitative approaches are considered the most appropriate to understand the perceptions and experiences of recipients. We included mixed\u2010methods studies, where it was possible to extract the data that were collected and analysed using qualitative methods, and we used only the qualitative component of the study for analysis. We included studies published in any language. We included studies regardless of whether or not they were conducted alongside studies of the effectiveness of cash transfers included in\u00a0Lagarde 2009\u00a0and\u00a0Pega 2022. We did not use a quality threshold and we did not exclude studies based on our assessment of methodological limitations. We used the information about methodological limitations to assess our confidence in the review findings, using the GRADE\u2010CERQual approach (GRADE\u2010CERQual 2022). We searched databases from their inception to 5 June 2020 and the search was updated in July 2022. The new studies found are awaiting classification.",
        "Topic of interest": "We included studies that reported on experiences or perceptions from recipients of cash transfer interventions provided by governmental, non\u2010governmental or international agencies, or private non\u2010 or for\u2010profit agencies targeted for improving health or health behaviours or that were assessed for health outcomes. We included different types of cash transfer interventions, which we categorised as unconditional cash transfers (UCT), conditional cash transfers (CCT), or cash\u2010plus interventions that could include either a conditional or unconditional cash transfer component.\u00a0 We defined a UCT programme as non\u2010contributory monetary payments to individuals by governmental, international or non\u2010governmental organisations to help them meet minimum consumption needs (Garcia 2012). A CCT programme is defined as similar non\u2010contributory monetary payments to individuals if a condition, typically a behaviour requirement, is fulfilled. We defined cash\u2010plus interventions as programmes where either unconditional or conditional cash was given together with additional services, such as health checks, training or education sessions, psychosocial support or referrals to social services The types of participants in the studies included recipients or carers of recipients of conditional or unconditional cash transfers or cash\u2010plus interventions.\u00a0 We defined the recipients or carers as people who received a cash transfer as part of a government, non\u2010government or project\u2010based initiative.\u00a0 Participants could be: adult patients of healthcare services;   the general adult population where the programme was assessed in terms of health impact or provided for purposes of initiating, maintaining or increasing preventive or curative health behaviours (e.g. vaccination, treatment adherence, contraceptive use or testing or screening for diseases) or the avoidance of unhealthy behaviours (e.g. smoking cessation);    adult caregiver recipients where the cash transfers were intended to benefit those receiving care, including but not limited to, children. adult patients of healthcare services; the general adult population where the programme was assessed in terms of health impact or provided for purposes of initiating, maintaining or increasing preventive or curative health behaviours (e.g. vaccination, treatment adherence, contraceptive use or testing or screening for diseases) or the avoidance of unhealthy behaviours (e.g. smoking cessation); adult caregiver recipients where the cash transfers were intended to benefit those receiving care, including but not limited to, children. We conducted a global review, which was not limited to any particular setting or geographic location. Participants in the studies could come from any healthcare setting, primary, secondary and tertiary, or they could be outside the formal healthcare setting. We included any physical or mental health condition of participants. We included studies focused on conditional cash transfers, unconditional cash transfers, or cash\u2010plus interventions, where cash was paid to individuals by governmental, international or non\u2010governmental organisations in connection to national or local social protection programmes or research studies.",
